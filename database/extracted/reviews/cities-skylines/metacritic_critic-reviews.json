    "comments": "Over a decade old SimCity 4 has finally found its challenger. He is young, nimble and not afraid to go into the ring in cheap shorts without a sponsor sticker. Even where the game stumbles, it is more functional than the recent attempt to restart once sovereign SimCity brand. Someone can say it’s a copycat of SimCity but they did a better job, so what.",

The Finnish team has created a complex and varied game, that\u0027s also full of possibilities and without the boredom that emerged after only a few hours in Cities XXL.",

While Skylines doesn’t offer any groundbreaking novelties, it does genre’s basics very well and tries to make city-building interface as user-friendly as possible. [May 2015, p.60]",
