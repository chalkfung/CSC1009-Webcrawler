Starcraft helped catapult Battle.net to THE place to go for online gaming at the time. The visuals, music, gameplay and story is masterfully done. Blizzard during the late 90\u0027s was unstoppable. This, Warcraft 2 and 3, and Diablo. Starcraft is considered to be the pinnacle of pure RTS gameplay. There are other titles out there (most notably Command and Conquer) but Starcraft stands head and shoulders above the rest.

And what modern gamers need to understand, is that discussing Starcraft in this way is a bit like trying to explain to young boxing fans why fighters likeStarcraft, as almost anyone who grew up playing it will tell you, is one of the most important RTS games of all time. In this reviewers opinion, it is one of the best and most important games of all time across any genre, or platform. And what modern gamers need to understand, is that discussing Starcraft in this way is a bit like trying to explain to young boxing fans why fighters like Floyd Mayweather Jr would never stand a chance against legends like Rocky Marciano from the past. The reason is simply that games like this one were successful in a time where the competition was intense. In the 90\u0027s, gaming graphics were overall still pretty terrible. 3D gaming was limited in its capabilities, and still mostly relegated to the FPS genre. As a result, the decade produced some of the finest RTS games to have ever been designed before or since. Games like those in the Civilization franchises, the Red Alert Franchise, Warcraft, and others all were incredibly popular, and innovative for the time. So when I describe Starcraft as the king of RTS, I say that will the weight of a champion who has bested not only its peers of the day, but those who are considered among the best that have ever been. Frankly, this game is 20 years old, and I feel a review on the nature of its play is virtually irrelevant at this point. But I will say that despite its age, it continues to feel enjoyable to play even now. The greatest bulk of this game\u0027s design was in the replayability factor. It\u0027s simply off the charts. It is still played around the world to this day, professionally and there is ample reason why. As a young gamer, I knew what Starcraft was. Starcraft was the modern day Chess...except there were 3 unique armies, instead of one. In this way, and on a cubic scale, Starcraft will continue to be important in the same way Chess has been for centuries, for years to come. It\u0027s no coincidence that the re-mastered edition has only just come out, and in time I predict we will see that that release is just the first of many re-releases of what is unequivocally the best RTS ever made. Why do I keep saying that? Its re-playable, yes. But why? Simple. It\u0027s the most balanced game to ever be built. In any game system, in any genre, anywhere across time, you will see flaws in any system wherein differing groups are sent to face one another. Whether you look at games like Street Fighter or Tekken, or others like Call of Duty or even any given pinball machine, there will always be an *optimal* approach, race, character, or design which is simply superior to all others in the game. Inevitably, the game becomes more of a competition of who is the best at using that particular configuration to win. But Starcraft proved that games *could* be made which lacked this fatal flaw. While many players on the professional level seem to believe that the Zerg race offers an overall slight edge, this may be more about the likely psychological preferences of the kinds of players who are the best in the world, rather than a true edge inherent in that species. Moreover, outside the realm of top 1% of professional gamers, the rest of us will gladly be able to enjoy a seamlessly perfect warfare, with each race inhabiting unique advantages and challenges to overcome, as well as intricate and various means by which to counter any given enemy assault or defense. In spite of all the complexities the game offers though, the end result is the same: A simple to pick up, difficult to master, masterpiece of RTS perfection which will forever be the yard stick by which its successors will be measured. As a fan of all races, but one who\u0027s heart will forever belong to the mighty Terrans, I will finish off this review with a \"Shields up, weapons online!\" \"Awwww yeah!\"… Expand",

To be amazing at it isn\u0027t simple, and I think that counts for something.",

Great story, awesome \u0026 atmosperic music, strong and unusual characters, unexpected plot twists, hard missions, instresting units \u0026 strategies. Ah, those days when Blizzard actually cared about quality of their games!",
