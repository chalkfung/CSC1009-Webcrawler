The gameplay, both combat, building and just exploring, feels great, and when it does start to get harder it becomes really exciting defending your forts with other players. The basic ways to improve your character, skill points and xp, are given out to you by playing the game, (and research points are given out over time, even while not playing, one thing I really enjoy in the game is going to work and knowing that research points and heroes I sent out on resource gathering expeditions will be waiting for me when I get back :D) not just from loot llamas. However, when people says its grindy, that is completely fair, there is grinding involved, and I am rating this 10 because I\u0027m a big fan of diablo style games and grinding is something I\u0027m fine with, so what I would say to anyone on the fence about this game, do what I did before buying - watch some let\u0027s plays, I watched several before buying and that gave me a perfect idea of what the gameplay is like and that it would be my sort of thing.

The advantage of this game is that it is based on TPS Defense. You can join a party, defend a specific place, or attack. There are various characters and different abilities. Building a building and using it to defend is very good. There are three major drawbacks. First, there are too many factors involved in growth. Once you have selected a player hero card, you can choose another card from the [Squad] item and create a party to increase your hero card\u0027s abilities. Of course, each card has a variety of rare and abilities, and you can level up. This puts a lot of strain on the player. Second, a game that is extremely slow It takes a tremendous amount of time and effort to raise the level of the card I mentioned earlier. This game can become poisonous if you hate repetitive progress. You have to level up each card, but there are four kinds of cards. Hero, Auxiliary Survivor (including Defender), Weapon, Trap If you have to level up all four of these, you will have to spend a lot of time. And the skill tree is also very large and extensive, and there is something that can be taken over time. Third, the billing element I purchased Limited. For $ 16.99 .... Objectively, it does not cost much. You need to get a card and a schematic, which is all from drawing and not likely. I promised to give me a total of 100, but on the first day I will have to pay 70 times a day for the rest of the game, except for 15. There are only legend hero and weapon available right from the game. Those who have purchased a standard pack can be very hard to play early on. If you do not get a card at first, there is nothing you can do, so you need to get your card quickly, but there is nothing you can do. The bottom line is that the game is very good. I am very satisfied with the system or graphics, but the convenience of the users who play the game is not so good.… Expand",

It\u0027s always difficult to live up to years of hype, even if there wasn\u0027t a ton of it. Knowing that you waited to release the game solely because you wanted the experience to be great sets the bar pretty high, especially for first impressions. If I were writing this review based on my true first impressions, the moments I first began playing the game, I\u0027d likely give it an 8, maybe even a 9. It\u0027s an interesting take on the survival/crafting genre that\u0027s executed well enough. A few things might need some simplification, but the gameplay was solid enough and my experience was, at first, very enjoyable. That was until I realized how much of the \u0027fun\u0027 gameplay was gated behind mechanics that are more suited for dull, shallow mobile games, all revolving around the \u0027loot\u0027 system. The in-game drops are heavily-weighted (not in your favor, of course), time-restricted and overall just distasteful. It\u0027s the gimmick of flashing the shiny toy in front of you and doing as much as they can to make you want it, without actually giving it to you. If you really do want it, however, you can up your chances by paying out of pocket for the same random loot drops with different weighting. This kind of gameplay isn\u0027t necessarily damning in itself. Many games have done similar and still maintained a fun, free to play experience. The problem is that the rewards you get from the loot heavily affect your ability to play the game in the fun, exciting ways that you\u0027d like to. The experience is already a little grindy, which has its pros and cons, but adding a layer of pay-to-win gambling on top of it is a bit of a slap in the face to players who want to enjoy this to its fullest. I can\u0027t rightfully give the game a 0. It\u0027s not the worst thing I\u0027ve ever played. But it joins a growing pool of games that could have been great, but fell to the temptation of microtransactions and greed. No matter how many times I see it, it\u0027s still sad to watch. I\u0027d also remind you to be wary of reviews that are overly-friendly toward the game, especially when others have taken to criticizing it. They seem to be pretty professionally-crafted messages of praise, likely from the developers themselves or people paid to endorse the product.… Expand",

I\u0027m current at level 20 that mostly main soldier with a maxed out hero, have put over 60-70 hrs into this game and uninstalled. You will be in a constant state of farming for basic materials just to \"play\" the game. I keep sinking hours into it thinking at one point the game will get better but it doesn\u0027t. 1. Horrible grind. I had to create many private games just to farm nuts and bolts for my guns and traps. Some missions require me to burn through 3000-4000 light ammunition. Basically at the start of every game you will see players spend the whole 5-10 min just mining materials. Welcome to being an SCV in SC2. 2. Guns break and you have to recraft them. Constantly. Guns will break after 1-3 games depending. If someone leaves, be prepared to spend 2000 rounds of one ammo and 1500 of another. With that many rounds, your gun will be done with 8/10 of its lifespan. I recycle all my guns to get materials back but its not enough craft new guns. 3. You will always be short one material or another. Despite being level 20 already, i\u0027m still short on charcoal to make blast powder to make guns. So I have to now go create a private game to mine charcoal. Out of nuts and bolts? Mine cars in a private game. Out of silver? Go play games with silver as the rewards. But then that breaks your guns. Which you don\u0027t have anything to craft new ones with. I have two tiers of guns and avoid even upgrading some guns just so I can still use lower tier crafting material. But then you will just have to grind for nuts and bolts by destroying cars. It is endless nonfun gameplay. This isn\u0027t even grinding for levels but purely miserable. 4. The only character that doesn\u0027t have ammunition issues is the ninja. They are melee and often have maxed out ammo so you can ask them for some ammo on games. 5. Found a chest that glows? Surely you will get something good. Instead you get 20 light ammunition (that\u0027s not even one magazine full of a assault rifle that require 30). Traps? Low powered than you will need and does nothing to enemies. 6. All powerful traps are crafted. You have to find schematics which allows you to craft. Good luck crafting them when some of them require 10-12 nuts and bolts, which you need for your ammo. You can only carry a max of 999 wood, brick, metal. Just to mine cars to get 999 metal for example will take you close to 10 minutes, and this includes me critically hitting the blue dot. And yes I leveled my pickaxe to max. Its the first thing I level. 7. Epic level 20 solider. Bonuses include 16% chance to recover ammo, 10% ranged weapon bonus, 24% assault rifle bonus damage. I use an epic slug gun assault rifle (shotgun ammo), epic assault rifle, and a epic LMG. Those 3 are my main guns that uses different ammo but all count as assault rifle just so I can get the 24% extra bonus damage. Despite all that I still have issues with ammo, and crafting. Constant mine and grind. 8. Too much luck. 50 hours of gameplay and the only time I got good items was from the free 15 llama loot from the founders edition of the game. Despite finishing missions over and over I got some usable rare items once via mini llamas (that are awarded doing regular missions). 9. Premium V-bucks pay to play. Daily quests gets you 50 vbucks a day and you can swap out a daily quest if you dont like it once a day also. You can get vbucks via Challenge Quests. A lot of players even with 50hrs in don\u0027t realize that these challenge quests only go up to Stage 10. At the start you will complete these missions without even trying to aim for them. For example, I have a Eldrich Abomination - Stage 9, which requires killing 45 mist monsters for 50 vbucks. Once i completely it to Stage 10 I dont get it anymore. After which your account can only buy vbucks or get them via daily quests slowly. Painfully slowly. 10. This game reeks of microtransaction design. Allowing players to gain vbucks early on but slow it down midgame. This basically lets players feel good at the start but start to feel pain later. Why? People are willing to spend $ to remove the pain. Every microtransaction based game does this. There are amazing articles on microtransaction game design and studies show players will spend money to remove pain more so than to gain an advantage. This game is painful to play. 10a. All your FORT (health, weapon dmg, shields, traps dmg) stats require you to get these survivors. These survivors can be gotten via llamas. I use all my survivor exp, and fully understand the system via reading on reddit and i use all survivor exp. Its just another way to over complicate something and add an RNG so that you can buy their llamas. A nonmicrotransaction game wouldn\u0027t have this sort of system. 11. Many more issues such as HORRIBLE UI. One of the worst for a modern game. People botting and griefers who ruin the game. At the end of the day I ask, am I having fun. Answer is no.… Expand",

And the normal llamas, as well as the rare llamas are containing a lot of trash. I opened, thanks to the Founders deluxe editions hundres of llamas. So far not one single legendary character or weapon. Just normal stuff. The biggest problem of this game is, that there is no sense in doing all that. The zombies don\u0027t drop loot. The treasures in the world are only for the next games, no chance to find any schematics. You do the same over and over again for nothing.

It\u0027s actually more like a third-person Diablo clone, where you go through repetitive random missions doing the same thing over and over again (mine, scavenge, shoot some zombies at the end). Not only is 80% of your time spent on scavenging and only 10% building and then 10% fighting, *everything you build disappears after the round*. Your namesake fort is not permanent. It only lasts about 5 minutes, and then you have to play another mission, spend another 30-40 minutes gathering, and then build another 5-minute fort. You don\u0027t get your resources back either. That\u0027s the gameplay, which by itself is already overly grindy and tedious. Add in a gamble-to-progress and deck-building system and it soon becomes obvious that the gameplay was completely sacrificed in order to make room for a mobile-like pay-to-progress system. When you play the missions, the only loot you get are some crafting supplies and low-durability weapons that last only a few minutes of active use. To get weapons and traps that you can keep, you have to gamble with loot boxes ($1 each, or you can earn them in game at the rate of maybe 3-4 a week) and pray that you get \"schematics\", which let you craft them with the resources you\u0027ve scavenged. Even the crafted weapons have limited durability. To give you an idea of the progression system, this is how you actually gain power: * Gamble for epic, legendary, or mythic ranged weapon schematics and then level them up by recycling other schematics. Keep in mind that even rarity is not a guarantee of quality, because the same item could spawn with different random bonuses, so even a legendary could potentially have bad bonuses. * Gamble for epic+ trap schematics and then level up them by recycling other schematics. * Gather enough crafting materials by repeating missions and quests over and over in order to craft any of the above. * Gamble for epic+ hero schematics and level them up by recycling other heroes. Although you only play one hero at a time, you can choose up to 2 other heroes to add to your \"squad\" to provide passive bonuses, like a health or armor boost. You have to level up the other heroes in your squad, too, in order to maximize your bonuses. * Gamble for epic+ \"survivor\" schematics and level them up by recycling other survivors. The survivors do not appear in game at all, they just give you passive bonuses like your extra squad heroes. However, whereas you only need three heroes, you need several DOZEN survivors, each assigned to a squad like \"The Gadgeteers\" or \"The Engineers\" or \"Fireteam Alpha\". You have to mix and match survivor jobs AND personalities to maximize their effect, and that\u0027s in addition to the rarity system and the level system. By estimation, you\u0027ll probably need several hundred dollars of llamas to get anywhere near completion... or if you\u0027re playing for free, probably several lifetimes. Epic+ survivors drop very, very rarely. * Wait real-world time for research points to accrue, and then spend them on really boring upgrades (like + a few points to health or damage). To make matters worse, research points are also used to \"transform\" weapons (Fortnite\u0027s equivalent of the Horadric Cube in Diablo, which lets you transform unwanted items into something else). So you have to wait for several days worth of research to either gain some tiny passive bonus or use it to transform several of your items into ONE random item. * Gain XP and skill points to level up your skill tree (different from research), which is a mix of passive buffs and the occasional active skill. Something as simple as melee heavy attacks is buried deep in the tree, accessible only after 10+ hours of XP grind. Other much-needed game mechanics, such as the ability to recycle or transform items, are also buried in the skill tree. After 20 hours played, I still have not yet finished the first tier of the skill tree. It reminds me of Path of Exile, and not in a good way... when active game mechanics (i.e., the skills and abilities that add variety and gameplay challenge) are locked behind stupid passive buffs, there\u0027s only one real explanation... they want to lengthen the process to keep you paying. * There\u0027s also a \"Collection Book\" that requires you to sacrifice schematics and personnel for rewards. Once you sacrifice something, they\u0027re gone forever and you have to re-collect it from a llama if you want to keep using it. This is on top of the already insane need for recycling and gambling. Fortnite is a great idea sadly destroyed by greed.… Expand",

Fortnite has a terrible, predatory, monetization-based progression scheme surrounding a potentially fun set of core mechanics. It discourages cooperation and has unbearable amounts of grind involved. Do not buy this game. Do not support the development of games using this model. Spend your money somewhere else. If you must get it, then play it with a group of friends and try not to out level each other. There\u0027s no meaningful way to catch up. First things first: Gearbox has nothing to do with this game. Gearbox published the physical discs, but this game was developed and produced by Epic Games, which was bought by Chinese Tencent during production. Gearbox is to blame for supporting this terrible game model, but it\u0027s not their fault that it\u0027s this way. Second: The game is early access, but it deserves all the criticism it\u0027s getting. It\u0027s on store shelves, you can pay to play it now, so it\u0027s out there. Epic games isn\u0027t a small studio either and the game has been in alpha for two years. This is likely close to a finished product. The actual review: The core of this game is pretty exciting: fort style zombie slaying action. Players are supposed to work together to build a fort and protect an objective against a zombie horde. When that happens, it\u0027s a pretty sweet game. The problem is that the game doesn\u0027t encourage that kind of behavior and there is a massive monetization model laid over top of it. Progression is gated behind a number of mechanisms - which are either paywalls or time mechanics reminiscent of mobile games. There are multiple, independent systems required to progress in this game: 4 types of XP (commander, weapons/traps, heroes, survivors), 4 different core mechanics (weapons, traps, heroes, survivors), a skill tree (based on commander XP), and a research tree (gated by a passive time mechanic). There\u0027s nothing wrong with complicated mechanics, but the problem is that progressing on most of these fronts requires purchasing a reward known as a loot llama. You can only buy the lowest level llama, but it has a chance of upgrading to a tier 2 or tier 3 llama with better rewards - rewards you can\u0027t get by playing the game. The only way to get a llama is to buy one with 100 V-bucks, which you can either pay for with real cash or farm 50 V-bucks a day doing your single daily. That means you only get tangible progress every other day, regardless of how many hours you actually put into the game. The rewards from llamas are completely RNG though, so most llamas are actually worthless anyways. This model feeds on gambling addiction to milk players willing to spend cash on rewards they might never see (or maybe they\u0027ll get right away). Fortnite also punishes cooperation. Want to play with your lower level friends? Well, you won\u0027t get XP for playing with them, you get leveled down so you need to waste more materials and durability to have an impact, but because you\u0027re in a lower level area, you won\u0027t get the materials you need to replace the ones you use. Okay, what about playing with other people at your level? Because of the resource grind, many players (~20-30%) aren\u0027t interested in cooperating and instead spend the entire 20 minute games farming materials solo and ignoring the objective. Players interested in building have to spend huge periods of time farming just because other players aren\u0027t willing to share their hard earned materials with them. This game has so much potential, but it\u0027s being squandered under monetization and poor player incentives. Hopefully the dev team will change things during the early access period, but the alpha players have been making these demands for two years already. I doubt we\u0027ll see any real improvements. Vote with your money, don\u0027t buy this game. Don\u0027t let Epic Games get away with this kind of model in the US.… Expand",

In my eyes, at least 8/10 rating just because of how unique it is, its humor, and just the smoothness of the game. However, at its current state, I would not recommend it to ANY of my friends. Bad loot system: It\u0027s a game about finding loot, except the most desirable loot are behind a gambling system (think loot boxes). A player will only be able to get about 50vbucks (on average), this equates to half a loot box a day. While players who choose to spend money, can buy any amount of loot boxes as they so desire at $1 a pop. I could be higher \"power level\" than a player who has played for months, within 1-5 days if I spend enough cash. However, if you don\u0027t care how strong other players are, there are also OTHER bad implications of this system. The game has 4 general classes with about 6-8 subclasses beneath that. On top of that, each subclass can be different in rarity (commons and rares have about half the abilities of legendaries). So if you were to want to play the ninja class, you may not be able to. It would depend on what loot you got because heroes are loot too! And some may argue that you can easily find a common hero of any class. But let me tell you, the weakness of a common hero versus legendary/mythic will be significant very quickly. Poor Co-op In a team game, where you defend a fort TOGETHER, it would make sense that you are rewarded for team work. Not here. This game rewards selfish play. There will be many games where your teammates won\u0027t help you complete the mission. Either off doing their own side missions, afking, or just looking for chests. So it is not uncommon for one player to have to spend their resources completing the mission while the scumbags who don\u0027t help, get exp for the mission (same as the person who spent all their resources), gets whatever look they found while you were doing the mission, and gets to save/build up their resources because they were leeching off of you. Also, people who decide to be \"griefers\" can actually destroy the core of your base and make everyone lose the game on their whim. That\u0027s INSANE! There are numerous other ways to ruin a game too, but there are too many to list and VERY easy to do. Insane number of bugs By insane, I mean insane. This game is in early access (although it really wasn\u0027t marketed that way), but there have been so many bugs, that many players haven\u0027t been able to play for weeks. There was a bug on release week that many players couldn\u0027t play. Once they fixed that, there was performance bugs the following weeks where players still couldn\u0027t play. After their big bug fix patch earlier this week, many players lost their bases that they spent hours working on AND there were new bugs not allowing players to play! If you need a source, you can look at the game\u0027s subreddit. Every day, there is a new bug complaint about how PS4, xBox, or PC players can\u0027t play the game (although mostly console players). There are a sh*t ton more complaints. The only evidence you need is to look at the Fortnite Subreddit or forums. The majority of posts are about people being EXTREMELY upset and many players quitting the game. A recent poll on the subreddit showed that 48% of those who answered do not play anymore or only log in for daily rewards. This is only weeks after the initial release! However, you do not need to take my word for it, most video reviews and gaming reviews will tell you very similar to what I have. My best advice: Wait 6 months to see if the developers are actually listening to their players. The game will be free then and if improves are implemented, then the game would be worth checking out by then. But for now, buying the game for any amount of money is basically the same as paying some random guy to slap you.… Expand",

You have to pay to get into the Early Access, and by doing so you get some bonuses such as founders items etc. And overall the gameplay is fun and relaxing. Right now the gameplay is generally speaking built for a F2P model with P2W mechanics built alongside, which in the current climate doesn\u0027t make that much sense considering the majority of players right now have payed an upfront price for the game. I would have expected more leniency on those who had paid for the game but if I am honest it doesn\u0027t aggravate me as much as it does with others, mainly because I am happy to grind my way along the games progression, I am also happy to understand that it doesn\u0027t take a day to complete the game. If I could compare a model to the system that Fortnite will use it would be that of Hearthstone, you can play every day and get free cards and decks, or you can pay to get a bunch of free cards. Right now as it stands that price can be VERY steep if you go the paid route. But here\u0027s the thing, although you might have some very good cards it actually doesn\u0027t work in your favour very well as a P2W system, let me give you an example. You have 4 cards of same type of varying different qualities, lets say very bad, bad, good, very good. Now we take those different qualities and we try to level them up. Well the very bad quality is taking around 200 points per level, the bad quality is around 500 points per level etc etc (you get the point). The only way to get any serious points is by playing matches, you see where I\u0027m going with this, you can\u0027t actually use your high level cards effectively without also grinding out the game. It\u0027s not like World of Tanks where you can buy a premium tank/ammo and off you go, the base game cards and equipment all have to be levelled via grinding the game out. So you can level your cards, you also have to level yourself (The Commander) which again is ONLY done by grinding the game out, the other routes of getting levels are so marginal they barely count, if you go the route of filling out your collection book you will get around 10 points for a quarter filled book. Fortnite really doesn\u0027t give much in terms of options when it comes to levelling you just have to do the quests and missions, you can also recycle/retire old or duplicate schematics, survivors and heroes which will give more xp for their respective areas but it\u0027s very minimal in the grand scheme of things. In the end this game is about grinding, it doesn\u0027t even matter entirely if you do drop the occasional splash of money it will have the same effect as any randomly generated card game, you may or may not get what you want, I think this is what annoy\u0027s most P2W players out there if I\u0027m frank about it as it\u0027s more of a gamble rather than a dead set \"I\u0027m now better\". To me it\u0027s definitely fun and the game doesn\u0027t really start till you get past the tutorial and early starting missions, it doesn\u0027t challenge you early game which makes sense because once you start getting towards around the level 15 mark it starts to pick up. And trust me when I say level 15 is less than a quarter of the game, its probably around 10% of the game. For me I treat it like a fun bit of gaming to do every day for 30 minutes, I log in get my rewards or missions that I set over the course of the evening (you can send heroes away to collect stuff for 16 hours etc) and ill do a few quests and missions, if a friend is around we can do it together. A note on the other reviewers (just in general) I see a lot of players who clearly haven\u0027t gone past the early gameplay, I would warn those of you who know what kind of game this is (a Hearthstone card game with tower defense and loot mechanics) give it a chance, if you aren\u0027t bothered about paying wait for the F2P and just grind past the early game. I\u0027ll give some common complaints/answers: I haven\u0027t got any high level cards, paid or not paid. ^^ Yeah because in any game you jump into the fun bit is jumping to the end? Come on folks we all love shiny\u0027s but if you got them consistently they wouldn\u0027t be end game content anymore, you have to get the end game content by playing through it and the only way to get consistent high level cards is to trade in lower value cards. The loot in levels is low level. ^^ Yeah it gets higher level as you get higher level, if you consider after 20 or so hours you are still very low level, you start to get how much grind it takes to have decent drops, for example as a low level after completing the first set of Commander levels (i.e. stage 1) you only just start getting blue\u0027s drop. Overall I would say if you are on the fence just wait it out, it will be F2P soon enough.… Expand",

But apparently that was a \"bug\" and the devs then removed the ability for players to cross play. *It has a cash shop *Grinding is the key part of the game other key part being the cash shop I have played many f2p games over the years. But those games did not try to hide what they were. They knew what type of pay model and gaming model they were. Fornite on the other hand is pure greed. The game itself is focused on the cash shop in order to get better gear and heroes. You cannot get better gear or heroes unless you spend money in the cash shop on loot boxes. You might be asking, do they at least drop good gear in game at a lower rate. No they don\u0027t drop better gear. The loot boxes them selves are horribly unbalanced in terms of getting legendary\u0027s. Take it from a guy who spent hundreds of dollars on the game and only got one legendary gun. One just one. The game play itself is fun, in between the bugs and crashes. But after a while you start to understand the game is about pure grinding. Everything in the game needs to be grinded for. Guns,heroes, survivors traps and resources. The items needed to upgrade and move up are a bit rare and makes the grind even worse. You will rinse and repeat doing the same thing. Gather resources build your fort and defend against waves of zombies. The zombies rarely ever change in terms of looks of design even at higher levels. I cannot recommend this game. It is pure cash grab. All they want is money. They have the nerve to want people to pay for an unfinished game still being developed. Still having resets. But the cash shop is in full working order and takes all kinds of payment methods. For over priced loot boxes that give you 95% commons and uncommons no matter how much you spend. If you cannot spend money in the cash shop. Then good luck at higher lvls with your weak weapons and traps to defend your fort. You will be tickling the zombies and running out of ammo fighting those bullet sponges. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY!!! STAY AWAY!!… Expand",

The level progression system takes some getting used to, and it -does- take work to get some better items, but it\u0027s very possible without paying. For example, I just saved up my v-bucks (used to purchase llama\u0027s, which are basically loot pinata\u0027s) to purchase a high-end llama, got 5 legendary items in that one batch. This is all without paying a cent between my original purchase of the \u0027early access\u0027. The community is pretty good so far too, helpful and informative. People are generally pretty helpful and haven\u0027t seen too much hate in the chat box. Other than your run of the mill internet crack-pot. You know who you are! Maybe people are upset it can take so long to get certain items they want. And I admit, it\u0027s been difficult for me to get good traps.. But have been getting good everything else. Yet that can be half the fun of the game. There\u0027s really no need to pay, you just.. well.. play... Even with some of the basic items you can still do pretty well. Make sure to always play in PUGs. They -constantly- update the game as well, adding new events every month, which are different ways to get some good loot.. Which you don\u0027t have to pay for. I don\u0027t know. All these comments about pay-walls baffle me. It seems like a pretty standard game. And the PvE component is very long.… Expand",

As the game is right now, there\u0027s duo and regular (a group of up to 4 players) queue and you can choose whether to fill or not. When you find a game, you spawn onto an island just off the main map while you are waiting for the other players. Admittedly it\u0027s essentially only the waiting room, but feel free to loot and emote your heart out. Once there are 100 players in the game the bus leaves; yes – I said bus. You are dropped off onto the main island by a hot air balloon bus. When you drop you need to find weapons as soon as you can, you don’t want to be bringing a pick axe to a gun fight now. Your pick axe: probably the most unique thing about Fortnite. This enables you to be able to destroy things for resources, and thus build. Being able to build is a marvelous feature, it allows you to get cover wherever and whenever (given you have materials) and can also be used to get to places to loot or to gain high ground – just make sure you don’t build too high as if someone destroys one of the stairs, the rest will fall. You can even find traps to build, not that I\u0027ve found much use for them as of yet. As in all battle royale games, you have to keep moving to a certain point, Fortnite is no different. After a certain amount of time the circle shrinks, what follows is a pink mist called the \"storm\". Being outside of the circle is fine, just make sure you don’t get caught in the storm as it will outrun you and deals quite a lot of DPS. The rarity system for weapons is pretty cool, although you might have a different opinion if you find yourself on the wrong end of a legendary scar. Common is grey, uncommon is green, rare is blue, epic is purple, legendary is orange, and mythic is gold. As I\u0027m sure you’ve notices, Fortnite has a very different tone compared to its competition. Its cartoony graphics and relaxed environment gives the battle royale genre a light-hearted feel which is one of the reasons why it is unique. This may or may not be your cup of tea but it did the trick for me. Fortnite is by no means polished, but it\u0027s being updated regularly, just this week, duo queue and supply drops were added and soon there will be leader boards and plenty more. The combat system is pretty fluid, satisfying and quite enjoyable; however, movement is not. Movement is very choppy, it\u0027s really not easy to move unpredictably to avoid shots and feels quite unnatural to jump. Map interaction is also pretty poor, sometimes you get stuck and have to break yourself out, other times you think you can walk through an open gap but cannot. Fortnite is fun alone, however it is tailored for you to grab a few friends and experience everything Fortnite has to offer together while going head to head with other teams. Overall the guys over at Fortnite may not be able to spell, but they sure can make a great game with such low funding. Since its free, I believe everyone should give it a try, whether you\u0027re a die hard PUBG fan or have never played a battle royale game. Fortnite is a ton of fun and for a free to play game I\u0027m especially excited to see where it goes.… Expand",

I also feel like they have \"ghost patches\" where they change the gameplay without announcing it, or withholding information in the actual patches. Every patch something is hugely different without benefit, and new game-breaking additions are introduced. Gun-play is constantly being screwed with and is so far from being ANY good.

There is only any tension for a small fraction of the game and gunplay for an even smaller fraction of the game. Worse is that when you find another player and engage them in combat, nothing interesting is going on. It\u0027s the generic FPS fare, with strategy that involves jumping up and down while shooting at another player. Player health is low enough that the few interesting conflicts that pop up never last long. Some people can actively use the building mechanic as a tool, but this does not make the combat much better unless you\u0027re willing to master it. Wandering around the map and looting feels boring when there is too much loot and none of it (besides maybe the legendary weapons) feels both rare and useful. You can either try to win by doing nothing the whole match or risk losing by running into the action if you want to have fun. The game is only enjoyable when playing with friends, but only because it makes for a basic talking point when something actually happens. You have to be alert for other people the whole time and stay increasingly near the center as the match goes on, so it\u0027s not a very passive experience. However, if you want to have an active experience playing a video game, you\u0027d be better suited playing something like Paladins, Overwatch, Siege, Splatoon 2, CSGO, or CoD. Even Minecraft Hunger Games is better than Fortnite because of smaller maps that often have interesting design quirks, more health so that conflicts last longer and feel fair, and there is a variety of interesting loot that pops up. Anybody could just ignore the game and move on, but if you\u0027re a fan of Paragon (a much more artistically inspired and fun game in comparison) it means that your favorite game is being cancelled because of Fortnite\u0027s mainstream popularity. As a game, it\u0027s not as offensively bad as I\u0027ve made it out to be and at the very least it\u0027s free (unlike another battle royale game), but it\u0027s worthy of its current user score.… Expand",

And that is whereThis is going to be my honest opinion on both Battle Royale and Save the World. I think that Epic Games has so far done such a great job on everything for both sides of the game. From server maintenance to keeping the player database happy, the development team is constantly working to be able to make sure that we can get on in the morning and jump off the battle bus. And that is where things go down hill in my opinion. Don\u0027t get me wrong when I say that the game is very fun, and some can even say that it is addicting. It really gets fun when you go in with a friend or three. It is also very fun to be able to participate in the limited time modes, such as sniper shootout, solid gold, and teams of 50, all things that I wish were brought back to life. However, you would think that Epic Games would be as proud with the battle royale portion as they would be with Save the World, but the harsh truth is that they aren\u0027t really. You would think that spending over 6 years of development on the save the world part of the game would get more attention, but there are only a small chunk of players out of the 10 million plus players that own save the world. Being on of those people, I can definitely say that Save the World lives up to its name. Save the World is more realistic than Battle royale is, as you are able to craft your own weapons, and you need to craft ammo because if you don\u0027t then the missions are so impossible. I really like how intuitive the story line is, and it is something that I felt Epic Games worked on and wanted to make sure that the game was very lovely before it was brought out to the public. Some people may argue that the main part of the game, as you go in, collect materials, build a fort around the ATLAS, and then you kill as many enemies as you can in the fixed amount of time, and that is basically it. I am not one of those people, as I think that it is fun that you can take your time when it comes to collecting materials or simply exploring each and every nook and cranny of the map. Save the World also got the part right of being able to have different characters that you are able to use, and I think that is very interesting, as each and every one is different, as they have different weapons, health, special abilities, etc while Battle Royale does not. I do hope that save the world will be coming out for free to those who do not yet have it. Overall, both parts of the game is very exciting, besides the occasional server down times, bugs and lag, the game is very fun, and I do believe that it shall continue to go within the coming months and within the following years. I do hope that this will be one of those games that will not be forgotten, as the magic of the game is something that I do not think shall be forgotten. I am also going to ignore the 3.2 score for this game, I have not read any of the reviews yet, and I think that it will be very interesting to do so. Also, if you have made it to the very end of this review, then I truly bless you, as I do not really know why you would want to stare at a review that is over 3,000 characters long. See you guys on the battle bus! ;)… Expand",

Graphics are lackluster, an eyesore, and lazy. A cartoony art style means practically nothing if the animation and designs are unpolished and need I say, ugly. The designs of the weapons are nothing to write home about, along with the buildings practically being copy and pasted across the map that is already baron and just a bore to run around. Music is limited to about 2 or 4 tracks, and they aren\u0027t very good ones, I simply can\u0027t stand the loading screen because of the music looping every 45 seconds. Sound design is average, bullet sounds from both receiving and delivering sound fine, but some of the creative choices with the sound leave a lot to be desired. Gameplay? Is a chore! As stated before the map is open and empty with the occasional city with copy and pasted buildings with one or two unique variants, exposing how quickly the battle royale mode was tacked on due to the huge success of PUBG. Did you even know that this game was supposed to be a zombie survival game? I bet a lot of you didn\u0027t even though it\u0027s on the box art. Fortnite was hyped up as a co-op zombie survival game, but Metal Gear Survive was announced and the marketing as well as the game flopped.

There\u0027s a campaign, but the story is fairly lack luster. Most of the content in this regard comes in the form of characters with colorful personalities talking to you. Whether you find them charming, annoying or bland comes down to preference. There\u0027s really only a handful of different mission types and a couple dozen different maps, (some of which look extremely similar), that you unlock as you progress. The campaign missions basically give you busy work type tasks like fetch quests, kill X amount of baddies, win at playing X game mode in X district, stuff like that. Every map has a small number of different side quests you can do for random rewards and experience, though the rewards are often mundane. Most of your time spent on these worlds, in the early levels anyways, involves everyone completing these side quests until they\u0027re done or someone gets bored. The main mission can often be started at someone\u0027s choosing, but is sometimes on a 20min timer. The world is littered with lootable and farmable resources you can use to craft traps, weapons, ammo and buildings. The game has changed substantially so that attaining these resources isn\u0027t very grindy at all. Baddies now drop resources, mainly the sort for building structures. Once you\u0027ve upgraded your pick axe a couple times you can farm really quickly if needed. The main objectives almost always involve defending something. This is where you can construct a base, lay traps and gun down monsters or use various special abilities you can unlock. Bases tend to look largely the same, as you only need them for a short amount of time (under 10 min). Once the mission is over, they\u0027re gone. There are home defense missions that allow you to keep your base, but you can only play these missions every so often as you progress. There\u0027s a wide array of various traps, but they often aren\u0027t a necessity for defending. People will sometimes build a bunch of traps, but they won\u0027t get used because most people don\u0027t want to sit around watching cartoon zombies walk into them for 10 minutes. My understanding is that traps become more useful in the higher levels, (which take dozens of hours to get to). From here the game is basically just repetition. You play on the same maps, completing the same objectives, doing the same generic campaign missions to level up your heroes\u0027, traps\u0027 and weapons\u0027 stats. As you level up, you\u0027re able to play in higher level ques, but the maps are still the same; the baddies are just stronger. You do eventually unlock new worlds with their own unique maps, but the maps are still largely similar throughout. In essence, you progress so you can play at higher levels so you can progress in order to play at even higher levels. Get it? And that\u0027s the game. It\u0027s a massive progression machine filled with a never ending onslaught of dopamine releasing sounds and animations that make you feel like you\u0027ve accomplished something. For some people, this is all they need to have fun; because for them, progression is the fun. But as far as novel gameplay goes, the game gets old fast. If your friends play more or less than you do, it\u0027s hard to play together because of the discrepancy in power levels. Overall, the gameplay is either too hard or too easy depending on how strong you are compared to the world difficulty. If it\u0027s too hard, you\u0027ll simply die super fast to things and do no damage. If you\u0027re too strong, everything will drop like flies and you\u0027ll be considerably tanky. So typical RPG mechanics. The game actually has a diverse array of different baddies, but you only unlock them as you make your way through the campaign - which progresses ridiculously slow. Meaning the game is excruciatingly dull for a dozen hours worth of gameplay. It\u0027s like a really long, drawn out tutorial that never seems to give way to an actual story. There\u0027s a ton of interesting weapons to use, (though you need to randomly unlock schematics to craft them yourself), but you\u0027ll likely mainly use the few weapons you\u0027ve been upgrading. I haven\u0027t had an issue with the loot system and I haven\u0027t put a single penny, or V buck for that matter into buying lamas (the game\u0027s look box system), as I spend whatever V bucks I make on battle royale stuff. My hero and weapons have pretty much been absurdly over powered for the entirety of my play. There\u0027s a shop you can buy some high tier rotating items in for a limited time using money readily gained from doing missions and side quests. So getting a decent hero and gear doesn\u0027t seem to be a major issue right now, though getting the exact loot you want always comes down to really long odds. I\u0027ve put a lot of time into the game, as I find the basic formula relaxing and somewhat satisfying. But it\u0027s getting harder to play because of how uninspired and tedious the game is. Just a giant progression machine...… Expand",

The Battle Royale game has building to defend yourself and build forts, which is extremely exhillarating. The use of bloom adds some randomness to gunplay, but the shotguns are better than PUBG shotguns and the sniper play is pretty difficult. Epic games is a very benevolent developer that truly cares about the games they make unlike EA, and Fortnite is still Early Access so they are fixing it up to prepare for its full release once it is complete with their updates. Until then, this early access allows players to test weapons and gameplay, allowing Epic to fix their updates accordingly, which take barely a week to finish, unlike the 6 months taken by EA to fix up their problems. Fortnite gets many points for being fun and amazing at Early Access, and having its amazing developers working on it every day.… Expand",

It started out as great fun but that soon ended. So here\u0027s my review for this game. INTRO [0/10]: So first of all this free2play game costs money, why? I don\u0027t know, the only reason I can see is pure GREED. However, you are able to earn a LOT of vbucks and I mean a LOT, in those 25 days I gathered over 7500 v bucks, so that is really nice. But since you\u0027re (epic) charging money for a f2p game I\u0027m gonna be extra harsh, it\u0027s a horrible business practice that gets no respect from me, especially with all this money going to fund BR and none of the BR success goes back to actually finishing this game in a decent timeline. DEVELOPMENT [0/10]: The devs clearly do not care about the game or it\u0027s community as BR gets all the updates. The only updates STW gets are some to keep the fanboys with no back spine happy. Like the recent \"change your gun stats\" update, praised to heaven and back but really it\u0027s just terrible when you consider after roughly 30 boring quests there are none and after seeing the first zone you\u0027ve seen them all, just terrible. 7 YEARS it took EPIC to develop this EPICLY POS grinding simulator, no offense. The events are GREAT fun but should NEVER be the focus of the game, which it clearly is now. I don\u0027t feel like buying any llamas or skins anymore actually I feel like avoiding EPIC games now for many reasons. Saying there are 2 different dev teams is like saying there are 2 different teams for Wow PVE and PVP, I\u0027m sure there are, and it\u0027s no valid excuse ESPECIALLY after an laughable 7 years of development already. PROGRESSION [2/10]: You basically progress through llamas and llamas only, your alternative? well grinding your ass off, even Vanilla wow was less grindy, a game that had actual content offer besides the boring grinds it had. You don\u0027t level by playing a lot, naah course not this is 2018 you level by grabbing your moms credit card and buying llamas in hope for some sweet survivors/heros or that recycle xp. It\u0027s a terrible system and one of the many reasons STW failed EPICLY (pun intended) so far. Due to this system you\u0027ll out level your missions very quickly if you don\u0027t buy llamas. With me and one friend getting 200 llamas and 2 others none, we got to level 40 and they we\u0027re left at ~20 whistle end plank. One of the others is now 35 and another quit the game because he didn\u0027t feel like the game was rewarding enough and he\u0027s actually right, but than again we\u0027re all sub 30 we grew up with GOOD GAMES not empty **** GUNPLAY [2/10]: The gunplay is just terrible, just like in BR we are dealing with legendary guns that shoot bullets EVERYWHERE but straight, unless you zoom but even than it\u0027s just terrible. The gun sounds a terrible compared to BR, on a distance you can\u0027t even hear the difference between any assault. Such a shame. I\u0027m sure some \"huge\" update will fix it. GAME CONTENT [2/10]: After the first 5 missions you have basically seen the ENTIRE game, it will not change, there are no new missions, no new biomes except for your home base plot that you can ONLY use 10 times (there is no elite or infinite mode, after 10 invasions all of your work and resources are wasted), mobs will not really change, just in lvl and hp, it does not become much harder, going back to low levels is not really satisfying thanks to scaling, from 50k hp you\u0027ll get 7k, same for firepower etc. On top of that the already HORRIBLE story line just STOPS after plank, it just flat out stops and really there is no excuse for it to stop.--After 7 years of development time they couldn\u0027t be bothered with finishing their quest line.--So you\u0027re greeted with place holder quests that really nobody except for fanboys will want to do. Do 3x this boring mission again and again and again for no actual rewards. It\u0027s the No Man\u0027s Sky of today. FUN FACTOR [8/10]: Is the game fun, yes absolutely, it has such HUGE potential and it\u0027s such a shame the devs are basically not fit for the job. By the time it goes f2p lots of people will have interest but will be turned of because well there is no content, there simply is none besides grinding the same mission over and over and over until your cry your eyes out. GRAPHICS [9/10]: Like it or not the graphics are superb and we we\u0027re often impressed by them. It looks really cute which is one of the only reasons our female gamers wanted to give it a shot in BR and now STW, though the core game design stops them from playing--as it\u0027s well, really boring. One negative point being that EVERYTHING LOOKS THE SAME. Except for your home base there is no uniqueness to be found in the world which is a shame and just shows how lazy Epic game developers are, 7 YEARS OF DEVELOPMENT FFS!!!!… Expand",

Lastly, let\u0027s cover one thing. The overwhelming layer of HYPE surrounding this game. Everywhere I went on the internet it was all \"Fortnite\" this and \"Fortnite\" that, and while some of it was entertaining after a while it became unbearable. Every page showed some player character in some new skin or another brandishing a pickaxe, often with a skin that logically shouldn\u0027t be able to harvest sand from a beach. It got ridiculous, it was almost overwriting the things on the internet i WANTED to see, so I decided to give it a try with a friend to try and find what all this unwarranted hype was about. and sure, it was a little fun while I had someone to play with. A LITTLE. I played it on my own computer, alone, and died several times for no observable reason. I had no clue how or why I died, or what I could do about it. I uninstalled the game, the Epic Games Launcher, removed Epic games from my browser history and never looked upon it again. I do not get anything about this game. I do not like it, I do not like playing it, I do not like it being the only thing I see on youtube anymore. I see people flip tables when they keep dying over and over again and I ask \"Well why are you still playing it?!\" It honestly confuses me! It\u0027s not friendly to new players, it doesn\u0027t give you any sort of time to learn from your mistakes without someone who actually knows how to play holding your hand like a baby, (Which makes me ask how on earth they learned to play) you can\u0027t get any good loot you want without sacrificing a goat to the gods of RNG... All I can finish this with is how is this game still running? Why do people play this!?!?… Expand",

Do YOU want a PUBG where it feels like it wants to be competitive but has none of the aspects that allow you to be competitive? Well have I got a game for you . . . FORTNITE.

Almost every single game I played for the entirety of my experience in-game consisted of people who spammed wooden walls in the situation where they\u0027re found in an open field (y\u0027know, where you should die in any other game) or they\u0027d simply hop up and down (usually with a jetpack) while firing shots at you and usually winning the engagement. The game attempts to be a Battlefield Heroes-esque type game but fails to do that as almost all fights boil down to the same mechanics that weren\u0027t even intended for that purpose. It is obvious they intended the crafting aspect to be used for creating/constructing badass forts that you can also put traps in (There are trap floors in the game) but no one bothers doing that. Everyone simply uses their resources to create walls on the fly, in the middle of combat, to give them cover LITERALLY ANYWHERE. Oh did I mention that there\u0027s almost no falling damage? You can fall from a 5 story building and MAYBE take about 15 points of damage. Just leave this game to die out in the sun where it belongs. If you want a competitive KOTH game, play PUBG or another of the variants. If you want a crafting KOTH game, there\u0027s far better games out there that restrict crafting to not be used in the middle of combat.… Expand",

Although Fortnite shares some obvious similarities with PUBG it has a lot of obviousFortnite is developed by Epic games and was originally designed to be a 3rd person co-op survival game, That part of the game is still around but when the Battle Royale genre exploded with the arrival of PUBG Epic games saw an opportunity and remoulded their game, enter Fortnite: Battle Royale. Although Fortnite shares some obvious similarities with PUBG it has a lot of obvious differences. For starters where PUBG goes for the realistic mil-sim approach Fortnite goes for bright and colourful graphics. Instead of a military plane, in Fortnite we jump from a party bus. the premise is still the same though,up to 100 players are dropped into a map which is constantly shrinking due to the Blue Zone/Storm, with the goal of looting weapons and gear in order to become the last person or team left standing. At first glance you might be forgiven for thinking that Fortnite is a kids game and that would be a huge mistake. Whilst the game is massively popular with kids there\u0027s a lot more going on than just jumping around the map trying to shoot each other. Take the building mechanics for example. Building in Fortnite can be just as crucial a skill as shooting. Out building your foe can be the difference between an early return to the lobby or that much sought after Victory. It\u0027s frustrating to learn the art of building but it can\u0027t be overstated how rewarding it is when you manage to out-build someone, knowing that your skills were just better in that encounter. Building used in this way is pretty groundbreaking and sets Fortnite aside from its competitors. Building forts and trying to get the high ground can be important but if like me, you aren\u0027t very good at it then you can for the most part get by with just using simpler structures. It\u0027s clear though that to really become good at Fortnite then building is a skill worth learning. The game is in third person and whilst you do have an inventory system it\u0027s very simplified when compared to something like PUBG. It works well though and suits the pace of the game. you can quickly manage your weapons and consumables and each item is easy to identify. Battles with other players are very different to what i\u0027m used to on PUBG. They can be chaotic and over very quickly where as in PUBG I\u0027ve had battles which last for a good 5 minutes or longer. whilst Fortnite doesn\u0027t have the tension of PUBG it certainly doesn\u0027t lack in the fun and chaotic feeling. I love the loot system in Fortnite, no matter where you drop it is possible to get yourself reasonably well kitted out and get you in on the action or keep you alive long enough to get yourself better loot. Weapons come in a variety of rarities and these rarities can turn the tide of a battle. The progression system in Fortnite is really good, especially if you purchase the Battle Pass and is the area that PUBG fails miserably in perhaps the most. In Fortnight you have challenges to complete and levelling up your tiers provides you with fun rewards or XP boosts. Cosmetic DLC can be purchased from the store and there\u0027s none of the frankly pathetic Loot box system found in PUBG where you buy a key and end up with a billion red T-shirts. In Fortnite you visit the store, see what you want and buy it. Prices for Skins are a bit steep but you can earn Skins just by levelling up your tiers during a season and as it\u0027s a free to play game I guess we can\u0027t really say much about it. I think for me though the standout area where Fortnite absolutely trounces PUBG is in the way the game runs. Fortnite is so well optimised that its totally understandable to me now why so many players are leaving PUBG behind. Don\u0027t get me wrong i will still play PUBG just as much as I always have but one can\u0027t help but admire Fortnite for how smoothly it plays.… Expand",

But in all honesty, Fortnite is not only a deeply flawed game, but also one of the most overrated games in recent memory. For starters, this game\u0027s very concept is a testament to the sheer lack of creativity on Epic Games part. When it was announced years ago, it was primarily a survival, crafting game in the style of MineCraft. Then, they get stuck in development hell for years, and now when Battle Royale games in the vain of PUBG get popular, and suddenly its main focus is early access Battle Royale. this sudden change of direction is a clear indicator that Fortnite has never been about passion or original concepts, but rather a pathetic cash grab meant to capitalize off of whatever c\u003dkids are into at the moment. Now I am aware that there still is a survival based, story mode, and it does appear to be much more original than I\u0027m giving it credit for, but this review is mainly about the Battle Royale game mode, since that\u0027s all Epic has been advertising recently. The Battle Royale aspect of this game is abysmal for a number of reasons. First and foremost, the building mechanic, which is the one feature which makes Fortnite original, is not fun or even useful in many situations. Now, the idea of a littering the map with fully destructible buildings, and letting players create their own shelters sound good on paper, but are executed very poorly. While some experienced players can come up with creative ways to build and get the edge over their enemies, the vast majority of combat situations only require two tactics, building a wall for cover, and building a staircase so you have a sniper perch. Both of them are easy to do, and essentially are a win condition if the other player doesn\u0027t have any building materials. But for all the times no building is used in combat, the GunPlay is less repetitive, but still very unsatisfying and just not fun. Epic games has put no thought into designing combat zones. Most of the premade areas are just simple urban developments and buildings. With proper design and inspiration, this setting could be very fun and make for some memorable gunfights. But, Epic seems to have assumed that simply having the building mechanics and destructible environments automatically makes the environments work, and therefore they just made some very basic apartment complexes and houses and hoped that would be good enough. But that just isn\u0027t the case. If you drop into a densely populated area, then every battle will just be two players shooting at each other while ducking behind walls to reload. This is the bare minimum required to be a shooter, and by all means there is nothing exceptional about it. Compare this to pretty much any other BR game, all of them have much more elaborate and inventive combat areas designed to produce tense, and memorable gunfights. Even Totally Accurate Battle Grounds, a game made as a parody of the BR genre has level design miles ahead of Fortnite. Meanwhile the actual combat mechanics epic built into the game are so unforgiving and unfair that they destroy any potential for fun. The combat in Fortnight is a complete disgrace. Your max health is not nearly enough to survive more than a few shots from the weakest weapons, and as the game goes on and most players have the higher ranked weapons, then most firefights will be over in a matter of seconds. the ranking system in this game is so worthless that most weapons with any rank above common will kill in one hit given how most players won\u0027t be at max health after an encounter or two. Hell, the common version of the shotgun can erase a max health player in one hit. Now, some people may assume that if the game is so unforgiving, then maybe that\u0027s because it was designed to reward skill. But this cannot be farther from the truth. Fortnite is one of the first games I have seen to use a mechanic known as \"Bloom\" in its aiming. Bloom is a system where the game will randomly decide if you hit or miss your target. This mechanic essentially makes experience meaningless, as no matter how good you are, your actual success boils down to luck. All of these flaws can be attributed to one thing. Epic Games is a shameless developer who designed this game to extract money from children\u0027s pockets indefinitely. The way the game decides victory or failure on a whim, the way you die so easily, the lazy game design, the uncreative concept, The entire game is meant to be unfair and unsatisfying, so kids will keep feeling like they got close to winning and they might win if they just try one more time. This keeps them playing for hours trying to win, all that time seeing all of the fancy cosmetics other players are using. All of these cosmetics being locked behind paywalls. All things considered, Fortnite is not just a good game. It isn\u0027t even an original Game, it only exists as a pathetic get rich quick scheme by Epic Games.… Expand",

And if you get into just 1 build battle with just 1Honestly fortnite is a great concept of a building battle royale. but the thing is the game has lots of problems and they arent handling it in a great way. First of you legit have to spend about 5 minutes of the beginning just gathering enough materials to where you feel comftorable and by that time around 25-35 people already died. And if you get into just 1 build battle with just 1 good player you spend most likely 500+ of those mats just getting highground. And everyone in the community is complaining that there isnt enough mats. So what do they do? They are proposing that they are gonna but even a more harsh material cap. But in Fortnite you have so many counters to building. They have buffed ALL explosives to where they go through walls. C4 is the most prevelent since literally if you place one C4 it can destroy almost everything in a 3x3 area. And dont even get me started on the minigun and LMG Second is and the most biggest problem is the Gunplay. The Current Meta in Fortnite is to get the higher ground and use the pump, tact, or heavy shotgun to kill your opponent. Now me and a lot of players dont really have a problem with that because it kinda makes Fortnite well \"Fortnite\". The problem though is that the inconsistencies with guns is so terrible. You can literally be point blank with with a Tact or Pump Or Heavy shotgun or other weapons for close range. And hit their head or torso. But for some reason (my guess is the tickrate of fortnite being pretty low) it has a pretty good chance to either 1 do no damage. 2 do little damage. Or 3 do the correct amount of damage. Dont believe me? Well just go on youtube and search \"Fortnite Hit Registration\". You will find many people having a problem even professional players. Now they improved it a while back (I believe beginning of season 4 when they increased the tickrate and many other things idk it was a really big update). Also with the older update they added a replay system. You can actually go into the replay system and see where your bullets go and you can see the bullet impact where they go and how much damage they deal. And its honestly really sad to see that most of the time when you die that you have to go into the replay system just to check if they hit you or not. To add on to the inconsistencies is this mechanic that is in Fortnite and that is called \"Bloom\". What is \"Bloom\" well bloom is a mechanic that even though if you have a the rarest Scar and Average to Good accuracy it can cause you to miss your shots (except if you use another mechanic called First Shot Accuracy). To make it simple and easy to explain imagine you have your crosshair and you have it on the guys head like spot on and everything. And outside of the middle dont you have an empty space of those 4 lines on the crosshair (idk if that makes sense or not but if it does than it does if it doesnt than it doesnt) now put a circle inside of those 4 lines. Now within that circle those are all the possible outcome of where your bullet will go. Third and final reason is Epic isnt really fixing problems that many players are having. For instance there are many locations on the map where your buildings like ramps or walls will go underground (this is most prevalent in rivers). Another one that i personally been having is for some reason when for example im building double ramp double wall. I switch to a ramp after completing one set then i keep going forward but for some reason my previous build selection (which is the wall) and the location even if my crosshair is not even close to where the building has been placed (honestly if that makes sense then it does but if it doesnt than it doesnt). Honestly this is all i can think of. I dont know if this was a great review or not but i hope it helps.… Expand",

If there was anything negative I had to say about this, the learning curve is huge. Most people just get destroyed in the first minute or so. Another thing is that the servers are....to put this: weak. Regularly I now have to wait in queue about 5-10 minutes because the servers are overloaded. Please do like an update or something that makes the servers be able to handle more people (like I was saying, there are 17.5 million active PC users) and because this game has so many people attracted to it, I think you should prioritize upgrading the servers rather than...I don\u0027t know, changing the map slightly every week or so. Now you\u0027re probably wondering why I\u0027m rating this a 10 after all the negative stuff I said. To find the answer, look at the user score. Fortnite is in no way deserving of a 3.3! (The 0 people are probably salty PUBG fans.) If the user score was relatively close to the critic score, I would rate this an 8/10 (which I think this should be rated) but I want to try to bring the overall score up to a 3.4 with this review. P.S. I did say 17.6 million active users when it\u0027s actually 40 million, but 44% of Fortnite users are on PC, and 44% of 40 million is...you guessed it, 17.6 million.

Building in fortnite inPlease bear in mind that the review i\u0027m writing solely applies to the free multiplayer aspect of the game! Overall fortnite is a decent party shooter for friends. This is reinforced by its free to play and cross platform model. However many aspects of the game are extremely lacking. First off, lets start with the feature that makes fortnite \u0027unique\u0027 its building. Building in fortnite in short is a crutch. Used to create instant bullet proof barriers to avoid death, but even more so useful for players that use Macro keys. Giving them the ability to instantly build large, hard to destroy, structures while at the same time giving them a height advantage in fast-paced close encounters. I honestly hope that one day epic will start nerfing building times into a reasonable aspect of the game. Not its main focus. Secondly, the weapons. One of the largest gripes about the weapons ive seen while playing is the gun and bullet physics. Case in point, long range snipers in the game have the biggest draw backs having to contend with large bullet drop, and travel time compared to assault rifles, scoped or not with the same range but instant hit and no bullet dropping. While snipers do far more damage per shot they are utterly useless at long range outside of a lucky shot. Most players simply use them as a close or medium range burst of damage to a player before switching to another weapon to finish them off. Next is High fire rate weapons such as the Minigun and LMG. Both are completely useless in any type of confrontation. They are too inaccurate and low damage to be effective even at close range. Lastly is the hit detection latency in the game. Bear in mind, my adverage FPS in fortnite with shadows is 120 - 150 FPS with a solid connection of 40ms ping, fortnite does a fairly decent job of hiding lag in the game but its extremely noticeable in clutch situations where a enemy suddenly wipes you even though you\u0027ve done more than enough damage to kill them off. This game was an ackomplishment of advertising. Building so much hype off of the battle royale craze, but has a long way to go before becoming a solid FPS.… Expand",

Even after all that, i recommend the game if you just want quick fun with friends. This review could go on and on but just watch a video on youtube if you want more info.… Expand",

The game was fun but needed further development in later stages of the game and a bit more variety to keep it interesting. Perhaps they struggled with the concept as it was too hard to execute for them and they weren\u0027t making enough money off it. Nonetheless, beta-testers like myself saw great potential in the concept and continued to play in the hopes the developers would pull it off. Smelling their impending doom and thirsty for their souls, Satan came to the developers with a magical USB memory stick and told them that on this stick were the the blueprints to their financial success, and all they had to do was sign their souls away to have it. Happy to pay Satan\u0027s price, they jacked the memory stick into every computer in the company and downloaded the blueprints. As their souls were sucked into Satan\u0027s mouth, their collective void was filled with a new idea: a way to get people to pay for useless digital fluff instead of compelling gameplay via a fad-like gameplay called Battle Royale. They learned to treat customers poorly by ignoring customer service requests sent by players whose accounts had been hacked (all for the profits). They sell useless character skins to players to cover up the poor gameplay and actually charge money for emotes. Emotes! And so the notion of cooperatively saving the world died along with the developers\u0027 souls.… Expand",

It fits perfectly for Save the World, which is in itself is a great game, but it sucks in Battle Royale. Out of all the battle royale games, this one was the one I played the most, simply because how well optimized it was compared to PUBG and H1Z1. I always wished Fortnite had a no-building mode, yes I know it\u0027s what makes this game FORTnite, but it also ruins it. For PvE purposes, building mechanic is actually pretty good. But for fast-paced action PvP? Nope. They needed to redesign the building system before launching BR, but it\u0027s too late now. Epic Games realized how broken, OP and unnecessarily important building was in BR, so they started to introduce demolition weapons such as C4, Sticky Bombs, Mini Gun, Quad Rocket and Stink Bombs. But as long as they refuse to rework building, it\u0027s going to suck ass. There is no cooldown, no delay or penalty against spamming building, also editing wall parts is very difficult and buggy. I\u0027ve said it before, it\u0027s extremely obvious this system was designed while PvE in mind. Shooting sucks ass too. The ADS bloom is extremely high, even after all the patches. Shotguns are still extremely good at what they do, so someone with it is extremely likely to destroy someone without it in CQC. There is no damage falloff on explosions. They do the same damage with a direct hit or AoE. Save the World is a completely different game, a better game. BR is a haflassed cash grab. After coming on top as the most played game on Earth, they still charge 15 dollars per costume, and free battle pass has NOTHING in it.… Expand",

I play this game with my friends and it never gets old because we get to battle people and try to win. But that’s not the only thing Fortnite has different game modes which makes it interesting. Playing with friends can benefit your stats and can give you more xp so you can level up faster. But when you play alone you challenge yourself for more of a challenge and there won’t be groups of people trying to kill you at once. They also have updates every week which usually comes with some new items or game modes. When fortnite first released you would just fight small hordes of zombies but no there is big hordes of people playing this game. Even some celebrities play this game And this game can be played on almost all platforms including mobile phones. So this makes it easier for people to play when they are out of town or traveling. And a lot of other popular games like Assassins Creed don’t offer this same feature. Fortnite’s popularity is not really decreasing, if anything it’s increasing; around 40 million people log on to play this game every month. When a certain gamemode gets boring there is always another one so you can have more fun. In conclusion Fortnite is the best game because of its unique features it’s a game that’s fun for everyone to play alone or with friends.… Expand",

It isn\u0027t even a legitimate video game, just a toxic candy-crush-like game that is an excuse for a corrupt company to take other peoples money. I have only played for less than 38 minutes, thank God, and watched hours of videos and research on the game but I know enough about it.

First off, WTF happened to the singleplayer mode? If you\u0027re going to make a game that is pretty much solely battle royale, then ditch the single player mode and stop using it for game descriptions. Second, the battle royale gameplay is boring, either on Android or PC. If it\u0027s on PC, the game rewards those who can build the fastest and who can throw the most bullets and/or explosives at their opponent. And the mobile version is abhorrent. If PUBG Mobile can have a solid framerate with decent graphics, then why is Fortnite relegated to having either 30 FPS with graphics that look like censorship in a porn game, or 15 FPS with graphics only slightly better. Granted, I don\u0027t know anything about the IOS version, and the game constantly hyped that it was optimized for IPhone X, so maybe someone will get a kick out of it, but then comes the market and the Battle Pass. The free BP has rerwards only up to level 50 out of 100 levels. Basically, the Battle Pass is saying \"Thanks for playing, but if you want to have more fun You\u0027ll need to cough up at least 10 dollars.\" The market isn\u0027t any better, with everything there also costing at least 10 dollars, and the few things that don\u0027t cost that much, such as a 200 V-Buck emote, is locked behind either grinding the game\u0027s free battle pass for that one emote or spending at least 10 dollars. There is no amount of V-Bucks that costs less than 10 dollars. However, I will explain why I gave Fortnite a 1 instead of a 0, and that\u0027s because the console version is alright. There is slightly slower reaction speed from everyone and the game is at a manageable pace so that it is easier to not get steam rolled in the first several seconds just because someone gets some materials or weapons first. Other than that, the hype surrounding this game is utter garbage, and shows that not even thee memes that people cherish online are safe from pay-gating. And this game is from the same developer that made the excellent Infinity Blade 1 and 2? **** off.… Expand",

I like the concept, but they made the missions boring. Even if you complete all the objectives in the map, you still have to wait forever to finish. (timer has to run out first) Matchmaking is broken and slow. When you find a group and enter the mission, there will always be 2 players that just stand there AFK while the other 2 players do the mission for them. This is happening because of how the missions are made and the fact that you get full mission rewards for not doing anything. You can\u0027t find your own team because there is no chat in the lobby. Compare this to Warframe where you have to whisper people to find a team, this makes it much less likely for anyone to AFK. Also, in Warframe there are actually incentives in some missions to finish quickly, and i think if you die you don\u0027t get some rewards. Meanwhile in Fortnite you can die 20 times and still get full rewards. Not that you would die even 1 time while AFK because there is no threat unless you seek out enemies... I\u0027m not able to understand why they don\u0027t fix this stuff, it\u0027s much more important than putting in new heroes and weapons... I guess selling loot boxes to fans is more important?

Yet, it\u0027s not that great. Fortnite\u0027s entire success revolves around the in-game purchases you are constantly reminded to restock on. \"Hey! There\u0027s a new Fortnite skin out! I guess I\u0027ll have to spend 10 dollars on each one they add!\" Since this game\u0027s target audience is on the edge of the premature, Epic Games has no problem displaying their corporate greed for all the world to see. They have made billions feeding off of 5-year-olds\u0027 parents\u0027 debit cards. Fortnite\u0027s childish mechanics and graphics make everything seem innocent and harmless, and since it\u0027s free, your first impressions on Fortnite are mild. You don\u0027t really see any problem with the game. Then you discover its toxic community and desire to devour your bank account in one gulp. The reason I\u0027m not giving this game a straight 0 is because the devs clearly put a lot of work into this game, and, this should go without saying, you need an amazing game and marketing team to make a free-to-play game the highest grossing game of all time, so huge props to the Epic Games team. But, there\u0027s one thing about Epic Games. Their workers have been in studies showing that most of them do 50, sometimes 60 to 70 hour work weeks. Fortnite\u0027s massive success has led to the hundreds of workers at Epic have depressing lives and are eternally stressed out. If there\u0027s a bug in the game, they fix it immediately: they don\u0027t milk their customers into buying the game once and then not doing anything about it, they (I can\u0027t believe I\u0027m about to say this) care about their players. So, if you plan on playing Fortnite, be warned of this company\u0027s greed for money and not to fall into the trap of no longer being a \u0027lonely default skin.\u0027 This game can be fun at times, but I just lost it when they added a \u0027story\u0027 to Fortnite, which may be the dumbest thing that has happened to any AAA game.

Screwed it up again - Half way through the first season of it. They should\u0027ve just made Fortnite as a Save The World campaign and not a Battle Royale. Because all you get from Battle Royale, it\u0027s more of a bloody LAG AND PING Royale. It doesn\u0027t matter how beefy or strong your computer, console and Internet is, their servers just cause lag constantly. The main issue of it is that they keep trying to make their game stand out by adding promotions into their game like Avengers and Star Wars, it\u0027s pathetic. They add Lightsabers and First Order weapons and make them overpowered and for what? Just to give toxic kids an advantage? I don\u0027t even know why Lucasfilm is allowing for these greedy pillocks to do this. To me, Epic Games just don\u0027t know how to work their own game, my message is to them is that if they can\u0027t keep it stable and working, shut it down. It\u0027d be a wise choice. So altogether, if you consider downloading and playing this crap of a game, go for it. I mean it\u0027s not illegal to play it but I\u0027d consider saving your money and dignity from these type of stupid games. But I\u0027m gonna tell you, all you\u0027re gonna get from this game is: Lag, Broken Aim, Broken Weapons, Ridiculous Gameplay - Oh, and a toxic community. I\u0027m disappointed actually, it\u0027s just that Epic gets a billion dollar budget but yet don\u0027t use it to satisfy anyone\u0027s needs and support. They just flip you off and take your money. I\u0027m not gonna lie, that game had potential and I mean it, but it\u0027s unfortunate that it had no choice but to be dragged down by the company itself and the toxic kids who play it. It\u0027s just not worth your time and effort, Apex is more likely to satisfy their customers.… Expand",

Итог: игра была крута в 17-18 годах, но сейчас это донатерская контора для кошелька родителей - 0/10. EN: The game has now become boring, in the rinks some students from 5 to 10 years and more ages. In 2017-18, the game was great, but now it\u0027s just a donut shop. Epic Games do not want to do anything to promote the project so that those who do not have money could play at least with some skins than usual. In short, if I had registered in 2017-18 on Metacritic, I would have put this game 10/10, but now it\u0027s a game that brings developers a lot of money, but they are too lazy to do anything new and their own to other Battle royale games envied their originality. Bottom line: the game was cool in 17-18 years, but now it\u0027s donarska office to the purse of the parents is 0/10. (Sorry for my English, I translate with the help of a translator :) )… Expand",
