The three negative reviews expected something other than Counter-Strike. I could never get into Counter-Strike because of how you are either a total noob at the bottom of the scoreboards or a pro who can kill the entire team in 5 seconds. And it takes hundreds of hours of boredom to get good. In CSGO, that all changes. I\u0027m actually having fun. The graphics are the best Valve has done, the UI is very clean, and the new voice acting is actually pretty good. The recoil and hit detection changed, and now instead of dying as soon as I see an enemy I actually use cover, throw grenades, and more. It\u0027s a much more active game. The new maps are the best ever made in Counter-Strike. They are very vertical, which encourages flanking, tactics, risk vs reward, and more. The Arsenal Demolition mode is possibly the best idea ever for a game. The inexperienced have a chance of fighting back against pros, because AK47s and P90s deals more damage than a P2000. The pros feel a sense of accomplishment and play just to see how far they can go. I don\u0027t care much for the gungame (A CS original, CoD stole it), but it\u0027s rather well done. The new weapons and balancing really make the 12 year old game feel brand new. I didn\u0027t care much for the casual mode, as it is only very small changes. And, IT\u0027S $15. IT\u0027S 1/4 OF THE PRICE OF A NEW CALL OF DUTY GAME, AND IT OFFERS SOMETHING THEY DON\u0027T HAVE (GOOD CORE GAMEPLAY). If you want Counter-Strike, don\u0027t hesitate to buy it.… Expand",

The graphics COULD be better, but again its $15 and they targets multiple platforms and markets, they want the game to play for everyone and thats what it does, everyone in CS world wants huge amounts of FPS, so they get it with a bit less detail here and there. The main thing lacking I would say is tessellation or parallax mapping. Apart from that it\u0027s a much nicer looking game over CSS. $15! its a steal for such fun multiplayer action, now with more game modes added in and maps.… Expand",

This combined with bullet spray mechanic when moving makes aggression a weak and stupid tactic. I don\u0027t like playing this style game, but gave it a chance when valve released cs:s. Again, the same, but bullet spray and poor hit detection seemed amplified and I gave it up fairly quickly. Now we have CS:GO. To begin, the game is gorgeous and has more infrastructure to it than any CS before. It DOES have matchmaking which is annoying, but there is also the option to play dedicated so who cares? The bullet spray is either tighter or the netcode better, I dunno which. Overall it\u0027s still the same gameplay. The purchase interface is wanky, but most players will bind the relevant options and never use it anyway. If you love CS of any flavor, there is no reason you won\u0027t like this one. On the other hand, if you think CS gameplay is stale and want to see it mixed up so that aggression and and precision are rewarded rather than penalized, look elsewhere. This is classic CS with a beautiful engine on top. I think the game is a 4 gameplay wise, but I give it a 7 as most people reading this are probably CS players, and I think it\u0027s an accurate representation of what a CS player would award this game.… Expand",

New weaponsCS:GO may seem too familiar to those who have played Source, but £11 for a new title is a bargain, especially given the quality. Source felt a bit wishy-washy, with no official modes and servers. CS:GO is not only well-organised but more catering to less experienced players whilst still retaining the essence of what makes counter-strike a proffessional gamer\u0027s shooter. New weapons may seem more like reskins but I prefer the simplicity of having no silencers and the properly working stats and decent achievements right from the game\u0027s release as oppose to an update 5 years after the game\u0027s release or something. Global Offensive\u0027s graphics aren\u0027t vastly different, but it is certainly the best looking shooter on the Source engine to date, and doesn\u0027t look as outdated as it should do for a 2004 game engine. The game seems well balanced, snipers are impressive, the Scout/SSG is no longer terrible and genuinely viable in competitive matches. Blur is added to sniper scopes while moving to balance them too. WWeapons do seem balanced and people use more than just AK, MR, Deagle and AWP. The 4 game modes - Casual Competitive, Classic Competitive, Demolition and Arms Race means there\u0027s something for everyone. Sure there\u0027s no Capture the Flag but in a game where there\u0027s no sprinting, health regen, killstreaks, aim down sights or ability to revive or heal teammates, it\u0027s probably for the best. Gun game is finally officially supported, and Demolition simplifies the game by removing the need to buy weapons. I\u0027ve always wanted to try counter-strike properly but Source was just far too disorganised and had other distractions. Global Offensive brings the classic game into a modern setting without falling into the trap of being a Call of Duty clone. It\u0027s still counter-strike, with exactly the same gameplay mechanics as the original, but presented in a more appealing and fun package. It certainly feels more welcoming for newcomers than Source, which is a big plus not only for competitive gaming but for the franchise as a whole. The only thing lacking is Team Deathmatch, however this would require a \"Create a Class\" which would turn it into CoD. Arms Race fills that spot, and Demolition combines Classic CS with Gun Game. The primary reason why this game is more accomodating is because it was meant to be a port of Source to Xbox LIVE, so obviously some things needed to be changed or added to broaden its appeal. And for the most part, Valve have done a great job. Matchmaking is efficient, bots for offline play are exclellent with decent AI programming rather than the predictably linear Source AI and the package as whole is much more modern as oppose to Source, where it was a case of \"too little, too late\" when they decided to update it. If you haven\u0027t played CS before and want to give it a go, this is the best game. Equally if you are a seasoned Veteran it might make for a refereshing start if you are looking to get back into it.… Expand",

Global Offensive brings a range of new features that makes the game easier for those who want to learn how to play, the new \u0027Weapons Course\u0027 mode will help newbies get the hang of the very basics of the game while new modes such as \u0027Arms Race\u0027 and \u0027Demolition\u0027 is targeted towards the more casual player. For anyone who is yet to play, this game is not your generic shooter and practice is a must! One of the huge disappointments to CSS and 1.6 is the fact that you had to use an external website to have a competitive match, this is not the case with GO as Valve has implemented a new 5v5 competitive mode which allows more experienced players to enjoy the Counter Strike series as they know it. Graphically the game has taken a huge overhaul and now looks better than ever with new lighting effects, an intuitive new buy menu and a hud that is more efficiant than any of the previous games. However in comparison to other modern shooters, the graphics are not perfect but who has ever played CS for its graphics? The movement speed is different to previous games and will take a little bit of time to get used to as well as the new hitboxes which I used to disagree with but after many patches in the beta, Valve have constantly tweaked the game to what the community want to see. Your old favorite weapons are still there including the AK, M4A4 (don\u0027t worry its pretty much the M4A1) and the AWP as well as new weapons such as the Nova, Tec-9 and Molotov/ Incidinary grenade all feel at home and take little time to get used to. As usual, the map design is incredible and it is a pleasure to see your old favourites re-designed to suit the game. Barely any important locations have changed but Valve are still able to give them all a new fresh feel. The new maps that are featured in Arms Race and Demolition are not my scene but suit the style of game mode that they are for. During the beta there were invisible walls above the maps which prevented players from using the old nade spots however I believe that Valve has now patched this. The game servers are solid and over the 100+ hours that I have already played, I have disconnected very little and to be fair it was probably my fault not theirs. The only critisism I have is that I have seen no evidence of servers matching your skill level with others, this creates a problem when professionals with plenty of hours of play are joined with a team of beginers who think it is a great idea to join a \u0027Competitive\u0027 game. This causes a lot of rage quiters and when you end up playing a full game, you will notice your team emptying for a few rounds before others join. Valve has left the game highly moddable for the community to create their own servers and game modes if they so please and I look forward to seeing what modders can do with the game. Zombies is already confirmed as a mod for the game. Overall the game is awesome and I know that I will play 1000+ hours for the next few years. It is definately still a Counter Strike game and anyone that is a little sceptical is either a 1.6 player who refuses to change the way they play or you need to give it a little more time. And for $15 how can anyone go wrong?… Expand",

People may complain about CS having no iron sights, but the fact is all these so-called \u0027realistic\u0027 shooters are only using mechanics like head bob and iron sights for immersion. What iron sights actually do is slow down the pace of gameplay, it\u0027s an unnecessary complicating mechanic that would never work in Counter-Strike. At the end of the day, how \u0027realistic\u0027 can first person shooters be? Every shooter has tried to copy CoD after its inception, and even other non-first person shooter multiplayer games like Uncharted. It\u0027s the whole ranking up system, perks, killstreak rewards and airstrike crap. Someone who spends more time than you is going to own you and then you get to see their flashy personalized \u0027banner\u0027. That\u0027s not competitive.

Also spawn camping in Arms Race is too easy and the regular modes are one death and game over per round. Pretty boring. Waste of 15 bucks IMO.… Expand",

The good things are that the game looks great, feels great, and the weapons feel like they have a purpose. There feels to be a little more variety to this game than source, I felt that source ended up an ak/m4 war with the occasionally awp/scout. I feel like all of the guns are priced to the point that each gun has a purpose (besides maybe the pistols, why blow 400$ on a tiny upgrade in pistol when you could have grenades of all sorts). Besides the zues failing to show a purpose, it all feels right. The matchmaking works really well, and the serverbrowser is classic, they know to keep that the same. The cons arent enough to shy this game away from great but they are there. As with all counterstrike games, stratagy such as positioning and purchasing is almost always far less important than aim. Thats why there is a learning curve, most of the game is based on your ability to get that headshot. Dont get me wrong, this isnt the worst thing, because its much worse when its like CoD and all you have to do is use the same loadout. At least it takes skill, but your fun time can get ruined by one guy having godlike aim, but I digress, it can happen in every game. Other Cons include, which I guess this one is more for console versions, the maps. Theres only about 10 for classic gamemodes (but servers are already up with user made maps) and 4 for the new gamemode Demolition, with only 2 for gungame. The classic maps are good, the demolition maps are actually really good, and the gungame maps just dont feel right. The main con here is the underwhelming amount. That brings me to another pro (i know, outta place), Demolition. This gamemode has only one thing I dont like about it: its really simple. All it is gungame with stratagy. But it works, it feels different and skillful in its own respect, such as awarding really good rounds with grenades and flashbangs. This is not to mention that the maps they made for it are pretty good for the one-bombsite purpose they were aiming for. TLDR: Good game, GREAT game for the measly $15 price tag, if you have the choice, PC is the way to go to get the most out of it, but console players will still enjoy the experience presented. 1.6 fans will be dissapointed because of thier hardcore attitude, but casual and pro source players will probably respect the game, and remember, source and 1.6 will still be there.

The art style is a mix of Counterstrike Source and maybe TF2, not sure but it strikes me odd and doesn\u0027t look good at all. Also, adding bloom to everything does not equate to better graphics. Simply replacing textures in Counterstrike Source with high-res ones will make an older game look better than this one. Onto gameplay, very bad. Hit detection is bad, gun balance is not there, hitboxes seem to not work often enough. The radial buy menu is horrid for quick navigation and a total time waster. I played on low-ping servers but have to say this game took the lessons learned from Counterstrike Source then threw them away and done enough things different for only the sake of change. The maps are proof of this, they are either the same but with bloom added to hurt your eyes or they are worse with little changes meant to spice things up but actually tone things down. Many people who never played CS 1.6 or CS:S before will probably find this game alright at $15, I find it a waste of $15. Put the money to something better, catch BF3 on sale at $30 and you will get much much more.

Pros: 1) Nice graphical tweaks to old and tired maps give the game a fresh feel. 2) A nice jump in and play system which makes it easy to get a server without the hassle of having to find one. 3) 2 new game modes off the bat, \"Arms Race\" is a simple gun game type scenario where as you kill, you get a new weapon, this is using a deathmatch system as well, so you will instantly respawn. \"Demolition\" changes this by setting out guns you unlock by killing enemies with your current weapon, and you can get bonus grenades by performing well in the round. Both new games are fun, and I have spent most of my time in GO playing them! Cons: 1) Locked down netcode! - Anyone who has played CS of any type in the past will have tweaked the netcode to suit their specific connection/computer/taste. Valve has locked the netcode down so much in GO that you cannot really fine tune your system. This is a big no no to me! 2) Lack of maps - This may be something that will be addressed in the future through patches, but its the same old maps, and not many of them. You have Italy, Dust 1 \u0026 2, Aztec, Office, Nuke \u0026 Train. In standard game play scenarios you will get bored of these pretty quickly! That said, the new game play modes have added rehashed versions of old maps (i.e a short version of train), but to me it feels like there isn\u0027t enough content on launch to keep the audience entertained. 3) Ever changing models - As an old player of source, I got used to the colours of CT \u003d blue, Terror \u003d red (or brown!). However, with CS:GO each map changes the models, which isn\u0027t so bad in itself, however on some maps the models are so close in colour, you cannot tell them apart from any reasonable distance, which leaves me hovering over a player to ascertain whether they are on my own side or not....very frustrating!! 4) The cross-hair - I like the old cross-hair, however I tried to use it and it seemed useless, so I now have to use the abomination that is the \"new\" cross-hair. You cannot change its colour (as far as I can tell) and it takes up so much room on the screen when your running around, its just annoying! It does seem to recognize friendlies, so that\u0027s why I\u0027m using it. Overall, very poor! 5) Clunky movement, and shocking physics - CSS may not have been the best 1st person shooter ever, but it felt fluid and smooth, however you come across GO and it seems very clunky, the players all run like they have a stick up their backsides and the physics are 10 years old (cannot shoot barrels now apparently!!). That all said, the game is certainly entertaining. Better than CSS? No, but its certainly enjoyable, and with a few tweaks of the engine, some new content I\u0027m sure it will be here to stay. For the £12 I spent, I don\u0027t regret it, but if you are happy in CSS now, I would see the need to rush over immediately.… Expand",

Largely this is true although ICS: GO ; Ultimately its lack of any ambition at all makes this a disappointing upgrade after waiting for so long however it does stay true to the Counter Strike formula - perhaps too true! CS: GO is a small fine tuning release - its clear they had a mission of taking the Counter Strike 1.6 formula and making it look a little bit better than CS: Source. Largely this is true although I have yet to be in a game where player\u0027s did not make fun of the \"mushroom head\" looking counter terrorist hats (who signed off on THAT decision?) But the over all level design quality, the lighting, the HDR effects, the model details, gun details are one notch better than CS: Source ; and I do mean ONE notch. And this speaks to the primary reason this reviewer doesn\u0027t score CS: GO higher than a 6 ; for a company as large as Valve and as popular of an online game as Counter Strike is ; to shoot for the floor for this upgrade is not impressive. Gameplay in Counter Strike is largely enshrined by the online community and the competitive community as well. However this doesn\u0027t mean that many online FPS game\u0027s haven\u0027t made clear that certain improvements are necessary for balance. In Counter Strike the team that wins the first match is often likely to win the majority (and some times all) of the remaining matches due to their demanding cash lead in the second round. The cash system which was once innovative is now punishing. Other shooters present leveling system present more persistent systems where the player can advance and earn better gear and weapons that allow the player to not be instantly dominated because the other team was able to afford AWP\u0027s across the board in the second or third round! This out dated model from the 90\u0027s would have been an extremely welcome upgrade but was utterly ignored (yet again). Players will have to either mod their own play mode or wait another decade for Valve to drink from the clue cup on this one. Similarly long over due for review was the gun balance and \"realism\" (note the quotes around realism) of the combat model in Counter Strike. I can not count the number of times players have done a jumping AWP head shot either on me, or while I watched a team mate do it to the other side. The incredible over-powered one-shot instant kill power of this weapon should have been much more carefully tempered with a little bit of realism. Any player running or jumping should be given no chance at all to hit their target with a sniper rifle, and greatly reduced chances with reduced damage when walking. Other guns suffer from an array of problems from too wide of a spread (even when crouched) to too narrow and precise of a spread in all forms (AK-47 for example). With varying ranges of damage problems such as I shot a terrorist in the back with the FAMAS 5 times to have him turn around and head shot me with a Desert Eagle! Counter Strike: Global Offensive was an opportunity to raise the bar for skilled gameplay in a team environment. Instead a minor graphic overhaul is supposed to satisfy us for 10 more years. Thankfully the entry price was low enough it is still probably worth purchasing unless you are really enjoying your current version of COD then really this game\u0027s lack of maturity and modern balance leaves it desiring a lot more attention and may be worth skipping.… Expand",

The old recoil was just great, no need to change it whatsoever. Aiming doesn\u0027t at all feel as smoothly as before. Feels really \u0027console-ish\u0027. I don\u0027t know how to explain it in any other way. When moving around, it feels like your \u0027floating\u0027. Some weapons sounds weaker than before especially the AK-47 and AWP. They definately sounds too weak. In Source and 1.6 they sounds stronger. Added special effects... If I want special effects and a realistic game I go play Battlefield 3 anyway. For Counter-Strike? No thanks. Pretty much higher system requirements in comparison to CS: Source while they both run on the same game engine (Source). *Full game* was really just released as a BETA. Not even worth its current price tag. The only good thing I can think of is the simple accessibility of game modes, but this is not enough for getting 1 point on my grade. Since I put much more weight on the gameplay itself. The map updates is allright, but not for the better... Grade: 0/10 Conclusion: A truly horrible game. That is unfortunately really overated.

Be open to changes, is all I have to say. CS have been out there for 12 years and nothing have really changed. It was basically the same game from beta to 1.6 which sponsors don\u0027t like. Why CS 1.6 are dying is because of less and less sponsors actually give something to the scene, and why? Well because of the game being OLD and UGLY and so 2000. Grow some f\u0027ing balls and start playing CS:GO. It\u0027s the players making how popular a game is going to be.… Expand",

These sounds are incredibly realistic and so satisfying to hear! Overall, the game is fantastic, and is a MUST for any Counter-Strike fan.

Many maps have been removed from the game including Assault and the physics appear to be gone completely. The character models often appear too similar making it difficult to tell friend from foe. The new weapon additions are just plain weird and don\u0027t fit in the CS world, personally the shield made more sense than a molotov **** I do appreciate it is priced low but why pay $15 for a worse experience?… Expand",

Graphics: Blur, Bloom, Dirty AWP scope all this bull...t is not possible to disable and makes aiming MUCH harder. I mean some games using this effects wise - like BF3 of COD, but in this game this is something out of place. Maps: Totally remade with TONS of details. You can throw all your map knowledge to garbage. Also this walls you sweep before not penetrable now(or penetrable but not for most weapons). Matchmaking and gamemodes: You have casual gamemode where you don\u0027t need to buy armor and map limited to 15 rounds, 50% friendlyfire. This mode is not an option for hardcore players as there\u0027s competitive. In competitive mode if you leave while game in progress you\u0027ll get 1 week of ban in any gamemodes except from those where you play with bots. Now imagine you _need_ to leave _this_ time. It happens, right? Forget about this game for a week! I\u0027m NOT kidding. It means nothing for devs that you already payed them. Seriously - ban system is just sucks. Matchmaking also can take longer than 5 minutes. Gameplay: Forget about everything you knew about counter-strike. Forget about shooting 10-15 bullets straight from sitting position at middle-close ranged enemy aiming in the head - you\u0027ll miss unless enemy is VERY close. You can\u0027t control even m4 recoil(I\u0027m not saying about ak), don\u0027t even try, it\u0027s impossible. So maybe AWP is still good choice? Not at all. All that blur, bloom in addition to \u0027dirty\u0027 scope WITHOUT middle point makes it nearly impossible to play \u0027aggressive sniping\u0027. AWP scope is not dirty blurring **** with straight 2 lines. You can still shoot \u0027no-scope\u0027 but what the point when even buy-menu looks like Christmas eve?

When I first bought the game, it wasn\u0027t very polished, but now it has very few glitches and bugs. Since it is Valve, we get free maps and content, meaning the silencer might come back whenever it wants to and new maps will pop up with time.

Also, everyone has an equal chance, not thrown off by prestiging or leveling up, which adds balance.Overall, it\u0027s a fun, challenging, and addicting game -- I\u0027d recommend it to all gamers!

GO \u003e 1.6 \u003e 1.5 \u003e CZ \u003e A kick in the face \u003e CSS A few weapons have been added/removed, but the repertoire is very much intact. I question the removal of silencers (M4A1 and USP had them in 1.6) but no big thing. Same with the tactical shield from 1.6 which I thought was a lot of fun. Decoy grenades, and incendiaries, have been added. It is very fun to throw a decoy and watch people scatter or take cover, and the incendiary is an interesting addition; it creates a blanket of flames that lasts several seconds, to stand on it or walk through it generally kills you. Knifing feels a little faster, both in terms of click-to-damage time, and cooldown on the backswing; although I haven\u0027t timed it or anything so it could just be a feeling/animation difference. In any case, knife duels still work much the same and the skills are transferable. There are two definitely negative things about GO in my opinion: - The buy menu is now a confusing wheel that looks like it should be in a console game. - The \"Quick Join\" feature, just list the servers and let people pick. Anyone considering buying should be aware that several of the reviews below are, in my mind, incredibly inaccurate to the point that I feel compelled to comment on them; \"No ironsights.\" - I think this means that the writer expected something like Mass Effect, where you can hold down right click with any weapon and zoom in a little. CS has scoped weapons for zooming, and you crouch or walk to increase accuracy. CS attempts to be realistic, and the average terrorist does not have telescopic eye-implants. \"There\u0027s no point in having the body, because they\u0027ve made it so that body shots are basically like a gentle tickle\" - A short burst to the torso will reliably kill an enemy. \"Hit reg. It\u0027s terrible. Obvious hits will do zero damage at times\" \u0026 \"Forget about shooting 10-15 bullets straight from sitting position at middle-close ranged enemy aiming in the head - you\u0027ll miss unless enemy is VERY close.\" \u0026 \"Just as bad as the old versions, with a hitbox that\u0027s just as inaccurate as them\" - I have not found this to be the case, these people are probably just not very practiced at aiming, guns in CS have significant recoil and spread. \"You can\u0027t control even m4 recoil(I\u0027m not saying about ak), don\u0027t even try, it\u0027s impossible.\" \u0026 \"Much more of an \u0027uncontrollable\u0027 recoil.\" - Recoil is very much on par with all previous CS games. \"A considerable improvement would have been to remove extinct gameplay mechanics, such as \"being dead\", because what felt okay in 2000, doesn\u0027t make sense today anymore.\" - Part of the appeal of a competitive game is that if you fail, you are punished. If you succeed, you are not. If you were the first one to die, and it was an abnormally long round, you might be waiting as much as four minutes before respawning. In this time you can watch what other, non-dead players do, and try to learn from them. \"This title has nothing to do with Counter-Strike the Half-Life mod\" - Except for the guns, objectives, maps, look \u0026 feel, player base, factions, and name. \"No real way to compete with the best players.\" - except by improving your own performance. \"Lacks any kind of single player element or even objective goals. Sure there are hostages to rescue and bombs to plant but no one ever does that.\" - As this comment itself states, there are objectives to complete on each map. I have never encountered people consistently ignoring these goals. \"Tons of HDR, bloom and motion blur, only to hide graphics bugs / glitches and make you feel like something fresh new\" - Lighting is realistic, there is no blinding bloom or anything. Motion blur is only when walking while looking through a scope, I assume in an attempt to reflect how difficult it would be in reality to run around with a sniper rifle held to your eye. \"When moving around, it feels like your \u0027floating\u0027\" - Walking feels much the same as all previous CS games. \"the guns were highly unbalanced, the only guns worth using were the AK and the most powerful sniper rifle.\" - simply not true; there is a hierarchy of gun strength that correlates to the co$t, but almost every gun has a niche in which it would consistently outperform any other. \"no matter how I put my settings I was getting about 15fps at any time.\" - get a better computer \"Maps: Totally remade with TONS of details. You can throw all your map knowledge to garbage\" - I had no trouble instantly identifying every ported map. There are a few minor changes to some (eg; stairs leading from under the dust_2 bridge up onto it) but I am yet to find any which bother me. \"Also this walls you sweep before not penetrable now(or penetrable but not for most weapons).\" - In 1.5/6 most guns could penetrate any surface, even blocks of concrete 10m thick; in GO, you can only shoot through softer materials such as wooden crates or doors… Expand",

It is also nice to not have to pay for ESEA if you want to play semi-competitively. Once you increase your rank a bit, you will often be matched with like-minded people who want to win and will carry out strategies and be generally vocal in-game. Mind the hate this game receives from 1.6 and Source players who can\u0027t fathom moving onto a new game.

This game in itself does require more skill to actually use weapons (which some players often complain about for iconic weapons) but I like how they made an attempt to refresh everything and then provide some new default modes and the ability for community game modes as well. Replay-ability: Much like the predecessors, it provides a good length of fun team based game play and a competitive challenge in comparison to FPS shooters like Call of Duty (which is prey, spray, run around, heal, killstreak reward, kill without skill, repeat). In Counter Strike, you HAVE to put effort in killing even a single player, not too much, but a good amount for the average player and more to take down the more experienced players. This is also worth it\u0027s money because would you rather pay about $50 for a game that really doesn\u0027t make any true attempt to add anything or $15 for a game that may be small, but is even considerably replayable? This game may not be a huge step up from its preceding titles, but it certainly expands on them, even by a little bit. It uses an old engine but the engine is fairly adaptive and used differently for other games. Other personal opinions: It\u0027s sad to see that some people give some negative reviews of this game. If we compare both CS:S and CS:GO, you\u0027d more likely stick with GO than S because CS:S was a complete rehash of CS:1.6 with the simplification of using the weapons in game. You can spray players with little effort. In CS:GO it attempts to go back to its routes in order to make the game more competitive and not as simple as CS:S, recoil is higher and requires more control, but still slightly more tolerable than CS:1.6. Overall: I believe people should appreciate this game in the least. It tries to bring back good memories of how I used to play Counter Strike in my younger days. Maps are too small, but think about it, that\u0027s the principle of Counter Strike games, CQC and medium range engagements. Players would be better off using weapons up close but aren\u0027t limited to longer ranges when they\u0027ve mastered even the weakest of weapons. It is also more realistic that Call of Duty as hipfiring is inexplicably terrible if you just spray all rounds. In Call of Duty, whatever is in your crosshair will be hit and killed if they don\u0027t shoot back while in CS, you\u0027re going to miss after the first few shots unless you control your aim and fire. Give the game a try, and if you still don\u0027t love or like it, at least appreciate it.… Expand",

The thing that was always **** in CS was that your movement was horrible, it felt like coordinating a piece of concrete or a sack of potatos.

Counter-Strike is a very engaging and computer-friendly game for both FPS newbies and veterans alike. It aspires to create a style of gameplay for everyone through a concise means - those wanting to get right into the thick of things can dive into Arms Race, where you progress through a chain of different weapons from killing enemies, instantly respawning if you get shot down yourself, maximising your play time. Those wanting to take a more tactical approach to their shooter can play the classic mode, where being killed keeps you dead until the next round, and the goal of the match ranges from killing everyone on the opposing team to rescuing/protecting a band of hostages to ensuring the fate of a planted bomb. It\u0027s pretty straightforward, but it\u0027s everything it says on the tin. Graphics-wise, I think it\u0027s done a great job, with the particle effects of blood and gun residue managed well but lacking that bit of \"wow\" factor. The only music in the game is in the menu (aside from a few jingles in-game signifying deaths) and that alone riles you up for your next match. The enormous multitude of achievements and desire to get better creates a remarkable value for replay - then again, any multiplayer online game you can get a lot of time out of. I think the only downside to this game is that being on the PC you can\u0027t bring a friend over to do splitscreen - the XBox version is where you want to go for that. In conclusion, this is a brilliant FPS that drops you right into the action in a comfortable yet exhilarating game environment. I\u0027ve loved every second of it.… Expand",

It is the successor to the original counter-strike in every way that source could never be. The physics are tighter. No more feeling like you\u0027re a marshmallow skating across ice. The recoil patterns are not as predictable. In source, you could spray without considering recoil, in CS:GO, much like the original counter-strike, you must understand the spread of each gun and counteract the recoil when you attempt to spray. The matchmaking works surprisingly well, especially as more people continue to get the game. In August, wait times for classic competitive were \u003e 5 minutes. Today, they\u0027re about 30 seconds. With the skill ranking system games end up being pretty even, and with punishments for leaving the game early, people are generally inclined to play to win and be good teammates. There are, of course, some downsides. I think the balancing is wrong on a couple of guns, the P90 in particular stands out as being overtuned. This version of the P90 belongs in source, with no recoil and high damage output. You also get a bonus $300 per kill - a total of $600. However, there are other guns which have been made more useful. Duel Berettas are not a joke anymore, neither are the shotguns or the heavy machine guns. There is also the lack of officially supported maps. The maps we do have were originally created 10+ years ago, and some of those original maps aren\u0027t even in the game yet. It\u0027s disappointing to me that more official maps haven\u0027t been released yet for use in classic competitive mode. Incendiary grenades are also a bit of a nuisance. The high cost of purchase is of little concern when you\u0027re raking in $600/kill with a gun like the p90, and even though you can counter the incendiaries with a smoke, it still feels too powerful. All that being said, I\u0027m more than willing to put my full faith behind CS:GO and make the switch permanently from 1.6. As I said in the beginning of my review, it\u0027s the game I had always wished CS:S would be.… Expand",

At first it is impossibly hard as you are playing against people who are experienced mostly. Once you start getting kills you will feel elated. I got to nova rank and then they updated the matchmaking. Winning a game suddenly deranked you. I\u0027ve put over 300 hrs into the game.

The reason I\u0027m giving this game the abysmal review that it doesn\u0027t deserve is because of the community. This game is incredibly easy to hack. In fact, as of late, the hacking has become of epidemic proportions. I cant go more than 2 matches without encountering someone using wall hacks. Aim bots are turned on occasionally, but the real problem is the wall hacks. If someone is preaiming and you are in an unknown position and they get a first shot headshot through the corner of a wall, they are hacking. Reporting does nothing. I\u0027ve seen no reaction from Valve. They are silent on the issue. The sad thing about this is the game, in its own right, is addictive fun. But Valve is taking a vow of silence on this, never once directly addressing the community on this issue. If you play this game already, start hacking because everyone else is or inevitably will through frustration. If you are on a mac, you\u0027re screwed. The nail in the coffin is, again, the community. THIS IS NOT AN EXAGGERATION! Every single match has someone with an offensive expletive in their name and at least two players begin spamming the voice and text chat with abusive commentary. Homophobia, sexism, textbook misogynists, racism, elitism, even abusing people on disability is commonplace. Final verdict: the game mechanics are fun It is traumatic to play… Expand",

Some of the achievements names are pretty funny too \"disruptus interruptus\" or \"freed with speed\". Some of the maps are true CQB fights and very challenging. This game isn\u0027t ground-breaking and that\u0027s probably a good thing. CS:S is a proven winner in PC gaming. CS:GO just improves upon that formula with new maps, weapon upgrades and changes, and newer graphics.… Expand",

When I first bought CS: Source, I really enjoyed everything about it, except for the graphics, which looked rather dated by today\u0027s graphical standards. This game updates the game\u0027s graphics, thus fixing the problem. As for the gameplay, it is the same as it has always been: fast-paced multiplayer action. That\u0027s perfectly fine, I don\u0027t think this needs to change one bit. Counter-Strike should stay this way in order to stop it from being like certain OTHER modern warfare games (I\u0027m looking at you COD and Battlefield). This game has the classic Counter-Strike game modes of hostage rescue and bomb disposal, however, it also adds two new modes into the mix to shake things up a little. Along with these two modes, it also adds arms race and demolition. These modes manage to keep the gameplay fresh and enjoyable for everyone by awarding people with new weapons for kills. There is no story for this game, but it doesn\u0027t need one. The game is just insane multiplayer action for everyone, so a story is rather unnecessary. This game does also have issues however. The game does crash quite a bit. I\u0027m not so sure if this is a problem just with me, or if it\u0027s for everyone, but it keeps crashing and giving me errors such as \"The Steam servers are too busy to handle your request\". The good news is that this game is one of the faster launching games in my Steam line-up, so this does not hurt the game very much, and it is easy to recover from a game crash such as this. However, there is also another problem. This game lacks a lot of the old maps that veteran CS:S players will have come to recognize. Valve will probably add more in with future updates, but for now, there aren\u0027t too many classic maps, and several for the new arms race and demolition modes. Lastly, despite this game being better than Source, it probably will never have the lasting impact Source left on the video game community. Source was much more influential than this game, creating an online community that is still active to this day. However, I still think that this game is better, due to the upgrades that were made on the existing mechanics of Source, along with the new modes. Overall, this game is one of the best multiplayer games I\u0027ve ever played. It does nothing to reinvent the Counter-Strike franchise, but it doesn\u0027t even have to. All Counter-Strike really needed was a graphical upgrade, a few new modes, and a few more tweaks on existing mechanics, and it got it.… Expand",

This game is not like one of your Call of Duties where spraying is a means of getting kills. Some parts of this game actually requires that you have pin-point accuracy towards your enemies which can get a little tricky when you start this game the first time. I personally, a veteran of Counter Strike Source, did absolutely horrible my first attempts towards this game, but as time went on, I got used to how it worked. Now this game doesn\u0027t have the top notch graphics as some of you would have preferred, but the quality of the graphics does not determine the quality of the game play.

I personally don\u0027t care which side is right, because, to me, this game is basically what the original CS should have done. And that is, to be more user friendly. Yes I also played the original CS (although just CS:S) and I knew why it was good: it required skills in aiming, in timing and you needed team work, but it failed on the learning curve which was INSANE. Most of the matches were \"Arena\" based (there was also demolition but I rarely did it, while gungame was rare), and this was how I played: I entered, I walked in, I died from a headshot from an Ak-47 from an enemy at the other side of the map, I waited for my team to lose so I could respawn....this wasn\u0027t funny. Did I suck? Yeah of course, but I had no way to learn since I would die once I was alive! That\u0027s what this game did right: you finally can learn how to play, you can FINALLY play without fearing of dying after 10 seconds you\u0027ve stepped in...and I started to enjoy! While this might be a rant in a way, what I\u0027m trying to point out is that while it has no real innovation (just graphics and the interfaces), it\u0027s also much easier to learn and even newbies like me can go in, play and just try to have fun without being obsessively scared of dying! Of course, you can still play the original method as well, but it\u0027s all up to you to choose and you can easily try it once you\u0027ve mastered it enough. Aside the fact of the innovation, it has also other benefits anyway: the maps are still good to this day, with almost no possibility for camping or hide perfectly, both because it requires a HUGE amount of aming, and in Deathmatch the respawns are random, so you can easily die anytime if you don\u0027t move. I believe we got less weapons now, but more \"balanced\" in a way, although I can\u0027t be totally sure since in the original game I couldn\u0027t buy due to the my lack income of money. For flaws, in my opinion, I still hate the hitboxes being clunky and very sporadic to hit (like I said, I might suck on this...but I would miss enemies even at blank point range, while for some reasons I was able to headshot with my shotgun. From the other side of the map!!!) and some weapons aren\u0027t exactly perfect and in the end people use few of them in total. All in all, I really enjoyed this game and for the first time I was able to play a Counter Strike game and have fun, without however neglecting the old community and giving us all the modes we used to play, plus some customizations. I might be a bad CS player for liking the \"friendly\" way this game approaches...but personally, if a game isn\u0027t fun and it\u0027s just made of frustration and constant complaining, it\u0027s not worth of my time and I easily quit it.

There is barely any skill required from close range besides from spraying (according to my personal experiences) and they will either camp your spawn with a sniper rifle or wait until you come around a corner, and for the new ones among us, that\u0027s pretty much all there is to this game. Spawn, get killed, see how accuracy doesn\u0027t matter, and all over. The graphics are very dated, and by far the worst of Valve\u0027s source engine. The molotov effects look good, but it simply looks as there was barely any polish. People who say it has the best visuals by far haven\u0027t played any other Valve games, like Portal 2 and Dota 2.… Expand",

It is very unfortunate that this an abomination of a developer gets to work with the greatness that is Valve. A simple redesigned/graphically updated new Counter Strike (like the leap from 1.6 to Source) with new maps and weapons would have been sufficient but unfortunately they (Hidden Path) decided to add game breaking mechanics, add terrible graphics (it hardly looks better than CS:S, even after 8 years) and other retarded mainstream features. I would even dare to say that this game isn\u0027t worthy of a Counter-Strike title. This is coming from a big Valve fan and a long time CS player. Valve/Hidden Path, please stop ruining the series/your games in general and stick to the old school Counter Strike. The Steam statistics say enough, CS:GO is hardly in the top 10 of most played games, while 1.6 and CS:S were in the top 3 for a very long time (multiple years).… Expand",

I\u0027m going to keep it short for those that have been following CS since the 1.6 era; this it better than Source for the competitive edge; the maps are better balanced, some improvements to make it slightly harder to use the AWP (welcome in my book!), and generally better stat keeping. There are no move able props in this either, for example barrels are now static. Certain other subtle things have been done on the CT/Terrorist divide but not much, for example the CTs no longer have weapons that can attach the suppressor. For those that are new or relatively new, you\u0027ll love the game. It has plenty of modes, mods and maps. A community that just keeps giving and a very easy to navigate menu for playing with your mates. On top of that since CS has such a big following you\u0027ll never be stuck for servers. One thing that has made CS so good I believe since day one is it\u0027s responsiveness, so bare in mind this isn\u0027t a slow-medium paced game, it is definitely a quick one and you\u0027ll always encounter people that have been playing this game for a long time. It\u0027s hard to explain why I\u0027ve never stopped playing it, but it\u0027s the definitive multiplayer FPS shooter in my eyes and if you haven\u0027t played it before then for the price it is I wouldn\u0027t hesitate. A little news on the spec this would require and it\u0027s still low considering todays standards, which is a good thing people on laptops with a dedicated graphics card should be able to play this pretty easily. Bare in mind newbies that if you get this game you\u0027ll find yourself dead a lot, I find myself dead alot and I\u0027ve been playing for years.

I can\u0027t stress it enough that this game really shows its best side in the competitive playlists. They are serious- leave one too many of the 5v5 matches prematurely and you can be penalized. People play this to win, and in doing so, play very tactically. People are calling \"clear\" on the mic, sharing info, making decisions, everything that an online FPS should aspire to accomplish. And the learning curve is not too steep either. Listen in on the chatter and actively try to help your team and you will learn the maps VERY fast- it shouldn\u0027t take more than 2 or 3 rounds to learn a map if you pay attention to your minimap and learn the names for the areas on them. There is no better feeling in an online FPS than when you\u0027re on a solid team, facing another well-balanced team, 1:00 left on the clock, and both teams are playing well and in a coordinated fashion. Every map has its own little tips and trick regarding strategy that don\u0027t take long to learn just by playing, and once you know how to implement them and coordinate your team, you\u0027ll find yourself with win after win after win. ALSO, change your reticle setting to classic dynamic. Seriously. The CS:S style reticle is SO much better than the new one, improves gameplay 1000%… Expand",

The skill required to play the game is tremendous, and the learning curve is never ending. You have to strive to actually get better, not just unlock stuff, which for many players who have braved the COD and Battlefield generation is a nice breath of fresh air. Of the things I enjoy, the competitive mode is what really stands out. 5 vs. 5, winner takes all matches, there is nothing better in gaming. You and your team have to actually work together to get stuff done, and most players take it seriously, which is nice. You will have bad matches, and the matchmaking can get frustrating, particularly being placed into a match where most people are of higher rank than you, but for the most part matches are typically even and both teams have an equal chance of winning. The other game modes are fun and can help you learn how to play the game but I haven\u0027t played them all that much so it\u0027s not my place to talk about them. Arms race is one that\u0027s particularly fun and can help you learn how to handle all the weapons, but you wouldn\u0027t find me playing it anywhere near as much as I would competitive mode. Fun and helpful but not where the meat is. I could go on about everything but that\u0027s not really my place. It works as it is, and for $15 you will be hard pressed to find a better bargain for the amount of fun this game will allot you. I wouldn\u0027t recommend it for your typical casual gamer, and there really isn\u0027t anything else besides the multiplayer component, but it\u0027s fun.

Many reviewers like to get a “feel” for a game, and arbitrarily give a game a score that they believe it deserves. This results in wildly different scores between different reviewers, and vastly different scores between similar games. This guideline addresses these problems and scores games fairly and consistently. This guideline also gives scores that are usually similar to the metacritic score. The review score is based out of 10 points. There are no “half” or 0.5 increments. It is impossible to have a score above 10 or below 0. The review score will change as the game gets new dlc, drops in price, or if more secrets are found through the game increasing its appeal. The scoring is split into 6 sections. The first five sections can add a possible 2 points to the final score. The first 5 sections are Single Player/Multi Player, Gameplay, Visuals/Story, Accessibility/Longevity, and Pricing. Notice that 3 of these sections have two parts. These particular sections will be scored based on the stronger part of the game of the two. For example, if a game has a lousy single player campaign, but an excellent multiplayer component, that section will be based solely on the multiplayer as if the single player did not exist. This allows games to be based on their own merits, as many unnecessary features are shoehorned into video games by publishers to reach a “feature quota”. Games that excel in both areas of a section don’t receive should be noted in the written review, but cannot increase the score past 2 in that section. However, it can be taken into account in the final section The final section can add 1, add 0, or subtract 1 to the final score. This final section is the “wildcard” section. This section is for how the reviewer “feels” about the game, but limits this only to this section, rather than the entire 10 point review. This section can include any positive or negative point that was not covered in the previous 5 sections.… Expand",

Also the game modes are great You have a casual mode, this gives you extra money at the start and more than five people can join. There is now a competitive match making system which works well. There is the chaotic deathmatch and arms race which always rewards your kills with a better weapon. Demolition is mode with small maps and only has one bomb site which makes a more concentrated experience. Skins for weapons and drops can be found at the end of the game or by watching pro games in their fantastic GOTV app or just buy it is used by valve to entice casual\u0027s into the competitive scene. Valve has had added so much, but there are down sides. Firstly there are three weapons that are really OP Scar-20, Negev and the P90 which is over used. The other down side it that all three of these weapons are used so much in death match as you have access to them at all times without buying them. Finally is the drop system. The drop system is fine and dandy but I see no reason to buy a key. There is a key that is used to open a case. In the case you get a randomly generated weapon. Firstly why do I have to buy a key? The game doesn\u0027t randomly drop it. You have to buy it. Why can\u0027t I just buy the weapon myself when there is a great chance I will be getting a useless skin that has no value in the CS:GO market. This is why cases are worth around 3p-5p in the market. This game is great. But valve needs more improving to do.… Expand",

Their excuse is that they ban in groups so cheaters won\u0027t know what cheat caused it, however this means YOU get to play against cheaters for 1-2 months before they get banned. The server settings are subpar and despite Valve being told this, they won\u0027t change it because that would cost them more. The maps are full of useless clutter the designers feel you MUST take part of. When the community made their own maps and removed the clutter so low end PCs could play, Valve removed those maps from the mapcycle.

CS:GO is more a remake of CS:source with better graphics, smart changes to the old maps, new game modes, and some new features. This game clearly wasn\u0027t made for everyone, as it is less chaotic than CoD, and most other modern shooters. New players will have a lot of difficulty with the differences in gameplay. Most weapons have a lot of recoil, which makes them hard to control, rushing isn\u0027t a good strategy as you will die quickly, and you have to be careful with your footstep noise. In this way, it is very realistic. Although there are 4 new game modes, competitive, in which one team tries to plant a bomb and the other team needs to defend it, is still by far the best and most played one. This is because every match is completely different from the other. Losing a round means earning less money, and less money means less powerful weapons to buy, and because of this, winning the first round gives you a huge advantage over the other team. Killing someone feels better than in any other game, because you know they won\u0027t come back, and it shows you that you\u0027ve learned to play such a difficult game. Because of the system in which you don\u0027t respawn until the round has ended, your role greatly affects your small 5-player team. This is done better than in any other game i\u0027ve played. Overview: Gameplay: 9.5 The game is very tactical and balanced, and your role greatly affects your team. Graphics: 6.5 Although the weapons look cool, the game\u0027s textures look pretty dated. Sound: 8 The soundtrack is decent, and weapons sound realistic. Lasting appeal: 10 This game can easily keep you busy for hundreds of hours. FINAL RATING: 8.5… Expand",

It was a really fun modern warfare game that showed a new side to the genre in which instead of two armies facing each other, it was more of a game of cops and robbers, or in this case terrorists vs counter-terrorists. Now finally a sequel has been released titled Global Offensive. At first glance, peopleCounter-Strike Source was a game that I enjoyed from the moment I started playing it. It was a really fun modern warfare game that showed a new side to the genre in which instead of two armies facing each other, it was more of a game of cops and robbers, or in this case terrorists vs counter-terrorists. Now finally a sequel has been released titled Global Offensive. At first glance, people may think that it\u0027s just Source with more modern graphics. However, under those shiny new graphics, there is also far more to this game lying in its exterior. Because it is a multiplayer only game, it does not have an actual story mode. Therefore, unlike my reviews in the past, I will not be talking about the story. I will instead be talking about its presentation as a whole. So, does this game make its predecessors look bad, or should gamers just keep playing Source until the next millennium? Let\u0027s find out. As I stated, this is a multiplayer game, so the entire game revolves around the whole multiplayer experience. This game does not change much at all from the original Counter-Strike games. There are two teams (under tournament circumstances and bot matches, there are five on each team), and both sides can win either by killing everyone on the opposing team, or completing an objective. Different from the originals? No. Is this bad? Heck no! The gameplay of Counter-Strike was what made it so special in the first place. The gameplay still feels fast, furious, fun and fresh after all these years. It manages to keep these old modes, and also add new ones. The new gameplay mode additions to this game are called Arms Race, and Demolition. Arms Race is a mode where players compete for kills and get increasingly more powerful weapons with each kill. The winner is the first player to get kills with every weapon in the game. As for demolition, it is a much more traditional game of Counter-Strike, but instead of buying weapons at the end of every round, weaker weapons are awarded based on the amount of kills that you have. These new gameplay modes are a welcome addition to the game, and add more to Counter-Strike then it ever had before. Overall, the gameplay of this game is as fantastic as it has ever been. The graphics are probably the best of any Source Engine game as of yet released. Everything in this game looks absolutely stunning and beautiful. From the character models to the weapons, this game makes even its competitors look bad. Okay, that might be overstating it just a little. The source engine, though great, does not beat the graphical power of Dice\u0027s frostbite engine used for the Battlefield series. That\u0027s not to say the games graphics are bad, after all I just said they are fantastic. They just aren\u0027t Battlefield\u0027s. They are still better than Call of Duty however. The presentation is nice too. The U.I. is done very well, and so is the A.I. The A.I. is very intelligent and does its job very well. It has very good multiplayer servers. The maps are all very nice as well. It has many classic Counter-Strike maps, along with new ones. However, while this game\u0027s presentation is nice, there is one big problem that it will never overcome. It will never have the same lasting impact that Source and the original left on the gaming community. Sure it looks better, but it will probably never have the fanbase that Source has always had. This game is still fantastic on its own right however. Overall, I\u0027d say that this game is totally worth buying, even if you have never played Counter-Strike before. That is why I recommend it to everyone who wants to play. Gameplay: 10/10 Graphics: 9/10 Presentation: 8/10 Overall: 9/10… Expand",

It\u0027s a known issue but to my knowledge it has not been dealt with yet, which is unacceptable, considering how bad they are. One time I had a famas and I hid next to a crate and 3 guys walked by and I opened fire at their legs and they all dropped dead with like 1-2 leg shots each. The new maps are almost all terrible, and the ones that are good are only good when the teams play it properly. The best map is vertigo, which is this 3 level building map. Some of the low points of this map include the fact that when you fall of the side, you die halfway down the decent. Most maps are ugly and alot of them are basically a source map with a few textures and tiny things like trash bins and stuff added in. The game is very shiny, but in a bad way, it\u0027s like they wanted it to be playable on 2007 hardware, but also be able to look great on 2012 hardware. The result is a game playable on low hardware, but with terrible graphics even cranked up. Not that anybody plays with bots, but the AI for them sucks anyway. One easy-medium, if they see you they literally point your gun at you and pause for like a half second, and in a game where reflexes win 70% of the battles, its more than enough time to kill them. Some weapons do way to much damage, like the awp. If you shoot a guy in the foot with an awp, it can easily be lethal. The good point(s) are a few tiny things that don\u0027t really matter, but if I\u0027m giving this a 2 it need something, so basically the 2 good points are 1. The fact that if your playing as CT\u0027s and you start on vertigo you see the chopper that landed you there take off and 2. the fact that in multiplayer you can\u0027t be a one man team (to an extent, honestly if your in the right place with a longer ranged rifle or other weapons that go unusually far, you can pick off like half a team before you get hit in the leg by a lucky smg round that instantly kills you.… Expand",

I bought it on Steam , downloaded and started (EASY) . The interface was easy as usual to navigate through servers . Now some people who play the latest Army simulator games may think that the Visuals are kinda dated (May compare it with COD too) . and i dont blame them as they may see the comparison with latest games . But if i compare it with the previous installment in the Series (CS : Source) the visuals are updated . The Sound was the similar and my slight con as they might\u0027ve considered to upgrade or change it by now . Gameplay was also quite similar , but CS Gameplay was never easy , it requires special tactics and your deep knowledge of the map to get through your way . The new addition of Arms Race is pretty cool . Overall , a great game to try .… Expand",

CS:GO has released skins for your guns(Which in no way effects how effective they are) All the weapons are balanced, new guns!

In all CS:GO at the price of $15 is a steal, and I suggest this to ANY FPS gamer!… Expand",

In fact, Valve and Hidden Path were working with the CS community the whole time this game was being developed and they still are for updates. With new \"operations\" players are able to spend a small amount of money to support community map makers and be able to play on those maps they work so hard on to make. In addition, recent updates such as the Arms Deal update allow players to have their own gun skins, apply stickers, and even name weapons. As anyone who is new to the franchise, expect a difficult learning curve that is incredibly rewarding to overcome. Valve and Hidden Path are really outdoing themselves with this installment and I look forward to future updates.… Expand",

This game is no more developped, there are tons of real upgrades that could be made by this far, Even a new medieval game could be done with the same concept, still no upgradable, worst or better stuff. It could include new ready-to-use new medieval-fantasy weapons and abilities giving similar dynamic, strategic, reactive coop battles, similar modes (an apocalyps artefact instead of bomb, just giving an idea), and making some new maps is almost no work... Even if Devs made one of the best game in the world, it was a long time ago and they are still on holidays, so for now I do NOT advise to buy ANY CS games.

And that\u0027s the game\u0027s only downfall as far as I can see. I feel like the ranked system should have a smaller map pool that changes every week, as it is if I select every map before queuing I keep getting thrown into Dust 2, because that was and still is the most favored CS map by the community. Would be nice if they did something to force people out of their comfort zones in competitive mode, to me that\u0027s the whole point. Aside from that, still has dedicated servers for free, better hit detection and far fewer latency issues than modern titles that cost $60 and charge you for every map pack they release. The only reason I ever stop playing Valve games is because like everything else, I get eventually get bored and feel the need to try something new, but I always come back to Valve titles. They just do it so much better and give so much more value than everyone else in the industry, and this was even the case before they started earning that Steam money.

Its hard to convince someone like me that Counter-Strike could be re-released as a updated version of its predecessor. I feel like failed epicly with CS:Source, that game felt nothing like 1.6 actually it felt like a completely new game with similar version of maps. CS:Go is probably the closest game so far to bringing back to those days of the original 1.6 with a few perks that actually make it better in some aspects. Gameplay: Standard fps that isn’t friendly to your run and gun style. It revolves some sort of skill and when you play competitive you will find that its not a forgiving game. It requires focus and team co-operation. This game is made for multiplayer as there is very little single player content. Matchmaking is where this game shines, no longer are players searching IRC and forums or leagues for a scrim or match. You are given a rank that does fairly well at placing you with evenly matched players. You will encounter hackers who will ultimately ruin your experience but if you can see past that the game is very well made. Graphics: Up to date on today’s standards for computer graphic’s its nothing super special but it doesn\u0027t burn your eyes to play. Replay Value: Considering its completely a multiplayer game and has a competitive (E-Sport) side to it. It comes down to how much you enjoy it, if you do you will find yourself going match after match trying to achieve higher ranks or you will log in from time after time to mess around on a public server. Either way replay value is extremely high. Overall this game is a win, and if you are into the fps genre it is a must have. It will never replace 1.6 in the hearts of us old timers but it does justice to the name Counter-Strike.… Expand",

While this is a fun and competitive game, it lacks something, it may be the lack of change from the last counter strike (source), I mean yeah they added a new interface and a few modes and maps, but in my opinion it would have been refreshing to get a little bit more content. you can argue with me because the price is low, but to me, as a fan of valve and it\u0027s games I would appreciate a few more official modes and maps. The DLC might be great, but I\u0027m sick of paying for a game that is not complete. That\u0027s the bad news. The good news are that the game preserves it\u0027s good old fashion gameplay style, the graphics have improved and are a treat to look at, and the game works smoothly most of the time. Also I like the fact that each map has a different kind of characters as for the CT and the T. The new hostage rescuing system is fantastic, I like it better and I think it\u0027s something they thought about. As usual valve have succeed in giving the opportunity to add mods and additional maps and weapons to the game, which is great. I would give this game a bit more than 8 but less than 9 because it is not complete in my opinion. Still, I think it\u0027s a game every casual gamer should get, specially as a fan of valve and counter strike.

Back in 2004 Counter Strike: Source (CSS for short) was released and people were amazed with the vast improvements. What improvements you ask? That\u0027s what we were all confused about back in 2004. Yes the game obviously looked far better now running on the brand new source engine, but what else other then that? People were hesitant on switching over, as they had become accustom to the greatness of 1.6. As people switched we realized they had removed much from the original game or had changed it so that it felt completely different. Now different isn\u0027t always a bad thing, but when you remove certain things, it can be. But were not here to talk about CSS, were here to talk about the most recent installment of Counter Strike. Now they have made vast improvements with the game, but it also suffers some major issues, at least in match making. Once again Valve fails to put a region lock on another match making game, so we are playing with people from Brazil, Mexico, China and others. And i have mentioned in other reviews its not where the people are located is the issue (normally unless someone has 500+ ping and makes it so you cant even hit them) its the different languages that is the issue. CSGO is reliant on communication in competitive play to know where people are at, when they are rotating, when we see bomb and so on and so forth. When we cant make simple calls, it ruins the goal of the game. Another issue is that CSGO is plagued with people using paid hacks, yes paid costing upwards to 120 dollars for a 6 month subscription so that they can beat you in match making. When you see someone on the other team spinning circles while running down long A and getting all head-shots you know its not going to be a fun game. Many of the guns have been changed as far as spray patterns, damage, accuracy, and others which is okay, but i feel they are trying to hard to make every gun viable instead of balancing the most important guns. Overall it makes vast improvements over CSS and CS Pro Mod, but it still has a way to go to live up to the original CS. If you get some friends that like playing and you do match making with them, you\u0027re sure to have a good time.… Expand",

It\u0027s a more immersive shooter than any of the Call of Duty series, and the way the game is made requires logical thinking and tactical strategies to win rounds with your teammates. When the game goes well, it\u0027s buckets of fun. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this game to newcomers. There are many reasons for this. First of all, unless you plan to mill around in deathmatch or the other lesser-played game modes (so anything but casual/competitive), you\u0027re going to die, a lot. And then you wait. You watch your uncooperative anonymous Russian teammates slowly break apart and lose the rounds in the most ludicrious fashion. If you can stand the game long enough to become half decent at it, you may find that you can often shoot someone in the head, literally tracing the bullet into their cranium, only to see that it doesn\u0027t register the hit due to the sub-standard 64 tickrate matchmaking servers and/or your West Country internet connection, thus falling victim to yet another unfair situation. If your internet connection is not the problem, you may try using ESEA or Faceit to play your competitive matches with. So you can pay more to play the game for no benefit other than to escape the crap quality of the standard servers, or faff about on Faceit, waiting for the afk team captains to pick maps, or the other team to cower away during the initial deciding knife round. After a few bad experiences, I\u0027ve decided that Faceit isn\u0027t worth the hassle. Playing competitive also puts you in danger of not only numerous wallhackers, but mainly these things called smurfs. Put the image of the little happy blue creature out of you head: these are the players with a high rank than make second accounts to play against easier opponents. It\u0027s that simple, yet it\u0027s infuriating and game-destroying for us lower ranked players. And when you discover this in a competitive game, your only choices are to stay there and endure it, gradually losing your sanity, or take a competitive ban. If you\u0027re lucky enough to have decent friends, they may just kick you from the game, sparing you of either choice. Having played almost 3 solid week\u0027s worth of the game in total, I have accumulated a wide friend group who also shares my pain, but we still play together for the social side. This is when I can recommend the game, if you\u0027ve already played a lot of it and have many friends that also play the game. If you\u0027re new, and have less patience than a special forces marksman, you\u0027re going to hate this game. I hope that if you decide to play this game, you take my advice with a pinch of salt, as I am admittedly easily riled up in the heat of the moment, but if you too go ape, you only have yourself to blame. Also, look out for skin collecting. I\u0027ve been caught by it, it saps a lot of your money, and is literally an addiction. Not a good one like playing a great game or crack cocaine, one that\u0027s ultimately utterly pointless.… Expand",

There are hackers in this game which they know where players are and also when you walk around a corner they shoot you before you can shoot them.

As for the Competitive Ban, if you lose connection from the internet or you just have a bad computer, there should be a system that can tell weather or not you are leaving the game intentionally. There also needs to be a better Anti-Cheat system, because I will occasionally play with a hacker. I do like the system for banning the Hackers, \"Overwatch\" because it gives the people who are moderately good and better a chance to help the community by submitting the forum that they are or are not hacking. I am also not the best player out there. In conclusion I would say that CS: GO is worth $15, but some thing can be improved… Expand",

And it is the most over-hyped competitive game ever. Ballistics are way AWOL. Some pistols sharing the same caliber as an SMG will do more damage than their counterparts, and somebody can basically survive with up to 9 bullet wounds (eve, more) without, technically, losing all his blood. And this is where its major problem is. It has no gameplay logic, because it is 15 years old. Someone can survive a headshot, aiming down the sight on specific weapons doesn\u0027t mean anything, so you\u0027ll come to think your barrel is just bent. So you\u0027re forced to shoot one bullet at a time, and then you\u0027ll face an enemy, either having an M4 (the only weapon with 100% accuracy), or maybe he\u0027s going crazy on his trigger, and by some magic luck he\u0027ll put a headshot out of nowhere, or he\u0027s one hacking b******. Plus... Even pro players were caught cheating. I understand two reasons to this : the gameplay is broken, and it is not even protected. Valve Anti-Cheat is a pure joke. And the competitive bans are just plain stupid. I paid for this game, I expect it to play whenever I want (and not getting banned because I had something more important to do), be protected against cheats, and have a decent ranking system (I always get ranked down, even when winning games with positive K/D). So in a word... Thank you Valve for having Steam get you all the money you want (and having it ruin the PC games market by the way, why would I buy any AAA game at launch, since I\u0027ll get them 50% off three months later, so maybe the editors will stop making AAA games because they can\u0027t get the reward they deserve). And thank you for not caring anymore about what games should be, and ignoring your \"fan-base\" (or whatever you call it) with some dreams like Half-Life 3.… Expand",

As if that wasn\u0027t bad enough but no there\u0027s more.. The game is filled with cheaters that plague even the highest ranks of the game. Valve seems happy to allow the game to continually go on sale so that more scumbags can buy new accounts and almost get the game for free because of how ridiculously cheap it already is anyway. People seem to just be allowed to stack accounts to cheat on and get away with it for months at a time before valve actually bans them. They seem to have introduced this overwatch system which quite frankly is totally useless because it gives the people on overwatch almost ZERO responsibility in the end outcome as to whether a person gets banned or not. The guns are totally flawed as well. More often than not I see succesful eco rounds because of how easy it is to wreck someone at mid-close range with a pistol vs rifle. I cannot emphasize enough, please do not buy this game. It quite literally is the biggest disgrace of any fps let alone steam game to have ever been released.

If you played CS for the first time in 1999 or so: Valve completely lost my trust this time. It literally SUCKS. . I\u0027ll try to explain why in this review, also including some strenghts of CS:GO. I think Valve tried to bring the best from CS:S and CS:1.6, and also small tweaks from COD and BF (like skins, ingame menus and stats-tab). Why is this bad? Well, because if you think of it from a product positioning perspective - you both want to keep \"stickiness\" and also be different from COD, BF, Arma, Quake, Sleeping Dogs, etc. - The strengths and passion of Counter-Strike 1.6 was the simpleness. - You could needed to focus on a small amount of things at the same time (equivalent to mental-average memory capacity of players). - No \"levels\" (BF/COD) is needed, hit play - and play! How does it relate to CS:GO, other competing games and also CS:1.6? - Other games\u0027 strengths aren\u0027t a head-2-head sport-game like CS. The maps are bigger, the multitasking is different, the amount of players are higher, no vehicles in CS (etc). You see, and agree about simplicity? CS is all about it! Not flying airplanes or driving a tank. Good that we\u0027ve got it down. Then you also understand that with less features - each feature becomes really important. So when Valve\u0027s story writers decide to decrease the mag of the \"CS:1.6 game community\u0027s\" favourite weapon and at the same time \"delete\" your 9 years old gun control-skills from CS:1.6: 1. Does it make people happy? No, not really. 2. Does it make the game better for the average players? No! Not really. 3. Will it make people buy a 4th failed game in the series (Failed: CS:CZ, CS:S. CS:GO)? Absolutely not. Then we all read online about this being the world\u0027s most played game currently, using that as a benchmark for that Valve actually took the right decisions. Think again, if you have ever played with data in Cognos, Qlik, Excel -whatever- you realize that there are always more dimensions to the data. - You are actually comparing the time of 1.6 when the world barey had internet or a dual-core CPU!!! What Valve SHOULD BE THINKING IS: \"We realize that we lost (\u003drevenue) to COD, BF, WOW, LOL, etc. Now we have X things to accomplish so we can GeT_RiGht! again.\" What is actually missing from creating history again with the series is: 1. Exact damage as CS:1.6 (CS:GO is all about headshots). 2. Exact same gun control as CS:1.6. 3. Exact same hitboxes as CS:1.6 - CS:GO is weird and more random (harder to learn for skilled/frequent players). 4. Choice of keeping simple UI-format (pre-game+in game menus+tab+CROSSHAIR!). 5. T is red, CT is blue as CS:1.6. 6. Players raw-posture\u0027s and coloring as CS:1.6. 7. Give silenced colt (with 30-mag) a more raw sound. 8. The standard-voice snippets - really? Did you never play Half-Life 1? Get real - sound like a boss. Get rid of the Supermario-feeling. 9. Exact same reload/weapon switch timings. 10. Cooler weapons movement for: Colt, AK and Knife. - Oh my lord, I can\u0027t think of how LOVELY this would be. AND HOW MUCH I WOULD PAY FOR IT! Keeping stickiness with the old+current player base: - CS:1.6 damage, gun control and hitboxes. Keeping simplicity: - Hiding all the bloat-UI guff, (keep the new features, just don\u0027t splash them in my face) Valve 1: Why not try with a beta? I mean 1,2,3, 7 \u0026 9 (above) might only be configurations and NO NEW DEVELOPMENT. A couple of mandays of getting the feel for it. Google \"SpawN\" - he can help you. Valve 2: Why don\u0027t you ask some of the pro gamers instead of bribing them to play CS:GO? Valve 3: Google, Apple and Microsoft are all working to remove bloat from all platforms - Do you really think it\u0027s right to add it? Valve 4: One of usabilitie\u0027s core pillars is recognition. I.eg. the first time you used an iOS/Android-device, you knew where to click in order to open the phone menu. Think a little bit about the same thing here: Usability (recognition), stickiness (keeping skills from 9 years), product positioning (don\u0027t copy ugly things from COD/BF). In order to not be a complete **** I\u0027ll list what I think was very good with CS:GO: 1. Graphics. 2. New weapons (some should be invoke less dmg tho). 3. Valve setting your \"level\" to match you with equally skilled gamers - nobody likes to wait for a camping noob when you\u0027ve planted the bomb, and the noob is camping in spawn. 4. Without server mods - you see dmg made to killer (damage made overall is missing). 5. Colt and AK now has the same numbering when buying weapons. 6. Movement recreation is fair enough. 7. AWP is working as expected. 8. Money (reward) system. 9. New maps! Community created. 10. Without server mods - votes are working well. 11. The ingame map - love it. 12. Without server mods - support for no-blocking (what story writers call no-collision)… Expand",

But the bad side to the game was later on it became more of a game where players online would just want to get drops at the end of a match, or just completely make the game so ugly to even want to play.",

I\u0027m pretty sure if you take the time to search, you can find some interesting modes and maps in this game but I\u0027ve not found any. Personally I prefer Battlefield and Titanfall, sold at the same price currently. There is no killcam, come on. The casual mode is the one I prefer so far, I hate friendly fire. This FPS rewards camping too much when compared because of the size of the maps, the weapon available and the spread when moving.… Expand",

Cons: - Not tactical at all like everybody says. - Not fun. - Not addictive (why do people play this game for thousands of hours (literally)?) - No aim down sights, which is disappointing for two reasons. A) It\u0027s the year 2015. Battlefield 2 came out in 2005, and that had aim down sights. Why is it that we don\u0027t have it 10 years on? B) In the trailer, right at the start (about 13 seconds in, or about 1:33 depending on which trailer you watch) a counter-terrorist is shown aiming at a terrorist. Why is it advertised, but not in the game? Surely that\u0027s some kind of false advertising. - The are hardly any guns. - The recoil is the same every time you shoot each weapon. Surely you could make it so that the pattern at least varies every so often? - I quite like to see proper map names in a game, not file names like \"de_dust2\". Surely you could just make it say \"Dust 2\"? It makes the game look unfinished, if you ask me - it looks like it\u0027s still undergoing debugging. - Costs too much money for what it is. - The maps are absolutely tiny. - The game feels generally unfinished. It feels like more development went into the cloth physics for the the molotov than any other part of the game. - The micro-transactions make the game a f***ing abomination. It\u0027s like, \"Yay, I unlocked a case!\" but then you are told you have to pay money to buy a key to unlock something you just earned for free. What a f***ing rip-off. And why are knives so f***ing expensive? What is the point in spending so much money on something that\u0027s usage is in a minority compared to everything else that is used by the player? I\u0027m just glad I haven\u0027t wasted any more money on this piece of s*** game. Overall, I would not reccomend this piece of f***ing s*** game. I wasted my money on this game and all the other Counter Strike games. It says in the description of the game on Steam, \"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS: GO) will expand upon the team-based action gameplay that it pioneered when it was launched 14 years ago\". What has it expanded upon? F*** all! The game has been the same since f***ing 1999! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME - it is a rip-off and is falsely advertised in the trailer(s). It looks and feels unfinished, which for a game released in 2012, and now we\u0027re in the year 2015, is not good AT ALL. I have absolutely NO idea why the reviews for this game are \"Overwhelmingly Positive\", because there is nothing good about this game! 0/10. DO NOT BUY.… Expand",

Smurfs and cheaters roam the game rampantly screwing over the people who wish to play legit. As I speak, Overwatch is now out of Beta, so I hope we see some improvement. Valve also placed a new rule that you have to be CS:GO profile \"Private Rank 3\" to play competitive mode to reduce smurfing and cheating, but it hurts the players who are legit as well, since there is no way to gain enough EXP fast enough to play competitive mode unless you play around 100 dms and win every one. Kids who don\u0027t know how to be polite to people also bolster a percent of the fun I could have if the community was nicer to each other. On the other hand, I enjoy playing this game because of the high skill ceiling and some of the nice people you meet during the game. I have met people from about everywhere, from Europe to Asia. I enjoy talking to them and learning about their life opposed to my very stereotypical life in the States. I enjoy learning to play better, and eventually rank up, which gives me quite a bit of satisfaction when it does happen, my everlasting hope to be one of the best.

The release date was almost 3 years ago, and in the time span between 2012 and now, there had been, I believe, 2 Battlefields, almost 3 Calls to Duty, and almost 2 angel rings (Halo). Look at the game now. It had 6 major updates, dozens of eSports teams (like the notorious fnatic or NiP), and 4 major tournaments, all acknowledged by Valve. In fact, a 5th tournament is in August, when the game turns 5 years old. After 3 years you would think a game would die, right? WRONG. In fact, CS:GO will save you a lot of money, because it\u0027s still being played. A COD game costs $60 USD (38.10 GBP), with yearly installments. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is 1/4 of that, with only one purchase (excluding weapon skins). That is a long-term savings right there.

Even thought Counter Strike has now existed for over 15 years, the newest release gets updated almost on a weekly basis. Even though those updates do not change a lot about the game, they\u0027re usually minor bug fixes or SKINS CASES.. which I said I was not going to talk about. So besides all the work valve put in the updates, the game actually runs pretty amazing looking at your regular system requirements of most of the games today, CSGO doesn\u0027t ask for a lot. Even though there are some huge errors with hitboxes while planting/jumping/climbing up ladders, the gameplay is pretty darn good, nothing that\u0027s overly impressive, except the fact of how easy it is to play, but how hard it is to master, which it gets perfectly, or got perfectly as we see the game get more and more friendly to new players, which will only downgrade it in my book. The rating system used to be pretty interesting until gold nova players managed to hit legendary eagle and above, and be considered the best in the game, and global elite got overcrowded because of the VAC waves. Which are an amazing thing, which means that cheaters are get banned and valve cares about them, but they could\u0027ve easily implemented a way to not ruin the ranking system in the process. The competitive game mode is done almost perfectly, and besides that for new and unexperienced players there\u0027s a lot more ways you can play the game other than competitive, you have deathmatch, arms race, casual and many more community made game modes. Yes. You have a community workshop in which you can basically create your own maps and gamemodes. I tried my hand on this, and honestly the source engine makes anyone who\u0027s willing to put some effort into map making, able to earn serious money from valve if their map is good enough. All that combined results in a fairly good game, not nearly something you can call an amazing or a perfect game, but most certainly a game worth buying, because of it\u0027s low price tag. Don\u0027t spend your money on skins though, don\u0027t let the cheap price swindle you into spending thousands of dollars on those F**CKING SKINS!… Expand",

Yeah it can be fun, but thats what any shooter should be. I have played shooters for decades now among which also were CS 1.6 and CSS, so I have a big basis for comparison. CS:GO isn\u0027t perfect at all. It has one of the worst matchmaking systems I have ever seen with a skill discrepancy that is absolutely stupid some times. I myself got Master Guardian Elite after 10 ranked games or so (and many many people calling me a smurf even though I am not even good) and even there, people play absolutely horrible sometimes and somtimes they carry your sorry ass. The skill range goes from people who seriously don\u0027t know that planting a bomb on a secured spot is a good thing to people that ace 2-4 times in a game. I literally had dudes my rank scoring 2 kills the entire game while the first one had almost 40. Its almost never a close game but a stomp in one direction. CS:GO even 3 years after release still has a lot of major bugs like your mouse dissapearing, your game just turning black, not responding, kicking you out of queue for no reason, hovering 15 meters in the air after spawn, I had them all. But ok that just happens, I can live with that. What I can\u0027t accept though is the incredibly weak anticheat and the fact that CS:GO basically offers almost nothing new. Its just CS, again. And what they added, they haven\u0027t even come up with themselves sometimes. Gungame and deathmatch were mods in CS before they were implemented officially as a \"feature\", and even then they didn\u0027t really add anything like sensible spawnpoints, as in every other shooter there is. The gameplay is as static as ever so if you are a person who likes movement based games where you have to aim while going fast, flying through the air, then this is not for you. The majority of the game consists of camping and watching one spot for what feels an eternity until finally you either rotate or someone sticks their head out. The competitive aspect of it is still fun, especially if you play with friends, but that doesn\u0027t excuse it from being a mediocre package and that most of the \"features\" added are things that should be there in the first place. I expect more from the richest gaming company in the world, that only releases 1 game every 3-4 for years. The community in CS:GO is the worst community I have ever witnessed. It amazes me. I played CSS where people liked to be generally toxic too but CS:GO tops it up a notch. Every single ranked game that you will not stomp (and even then) there will be one guy flaming the entire team, leaving or trolling or saying racist remarks (like **** Russians\" , \"Germans are always like blabla\"). But I won\u0027t take this into account for the rating as every popular game that is competitive attracts aggressive teenage douchebags. I am just warning whoever might wanna play this game what he is up to.… Expand",

It\u0027s a great FPS in terms of mechanics, tactic and with a high skill ceiling, where teamplay is a real key to winning. Unfortunately, the game suffers from a bad netcode, resulting in moving targets having their hitbox often stand something like 0,5 second behind their character model, bad hitboxes which, despise the fact they are rarely synchronized, are also bugged in many occasions ( ladders, crouch jumping, showing your back while crouching,... ), a terrible community, probably one of the most toxic in gaming and a cheating problem that the 11 year-old Source Engine doesn\u0027t help at all with. Not to mention Valve shamelessly abusing the weapon skin system and milking their players, these latter seemingly accepting whatever micro-payment they could throw at them. After 1000+hrs, I decided to stop as the better I aimed, the more the synchronization problems and randomness of the game became obvious, and I\u0027m glad to finally let this community behind anyway. I\u0027ll continue playing it occasionnally with my friends, but I\u0027ll slow down from about 3 games per night to a game or two per weeks maybe, and I recommend you do the same, this game can easily become a waste of time and money.… Expand",

For the low price (14€, and during the steam sales 5€) it\u0027s definitely worth a shot. Constant updates and game balancing always keep the game at a healthy level of competitiveness and keep the fun up. In my opinion, CS appeals to both the casual player and the competitive player, having multiple game modes and an infinite amount of maps to choose from (considering that the players can create their own maps and game modes on the Steam Workshop) without ever having to pay extra. The only thing you can pay for are skins. Re-textured versions of the guns you already own. You don\u0027t have to have skins to play the game at all. But you will eventually get one skin. Then two.

There are so many angles of play and so many types of players. The community gamemodes add so much variety to the game and I love mods. The game is extremely balanced and requires no purchasable content that give you an advantage. The customization is excellent, with crosshairs that fill up your whole screen, to a viewmodel setting that makes it look like you are rubbing your face to your gun. It is easy to mute annoying people, (not that there are too many) and communication is seamless. If only in a competitive match, the bots would actually do what is told and not sabotage your match. Thats where I start with the cons. -CS:GO only supports 5.1 sorround while some other games support up to 7.1 sorround. -Bots are almost useless (I say almost because they sometimes stay in spawn and can be taken over if they survive) -spraying makes your screen shake, as well as sprays being very randomized. This is a good thing as well, discouraging players to spray. -taking silencer off of weapons has a negative effect to spray. (Still doesn\u0027t make much sense to me, but I keep the silencers on) -bhoping much more difficult. -cheaters -script cheaters -spray control macros/scripts Despite these cons, the game is so much fun and will give you at least five hundred hours of entertainment.… Expand",

I actually regret buying CS:GO even it was on sale. I suggest VALVE to update 1.6. CS became popular for reasons that it was simple and a bit unrealistic - where you could learn movement, bhop, strafes, double duck, etc. In csgo its pretty much jump, duck, strafe, point and shoot. Even shooting is broken. In old engine you could feel when you hit your enemy. Now you can aim and shoot in the face with no damage. It feels like you throw apples at them. Same for he gren.

The only story is that there are terrorists trying to plant a bomb, so the counter-terrorists need to stop it. NOTHING ELSE. If we **** on Battlefront for this, than do it more for CS: GO. 4.

Instead of Valve, a billion dollar company, focusing on fixing the game flaws, they focus on making cases. The only bugs they fix are the ones that are useless that only 1 person noticed.

It requires a non-demanding PC so if you do decide to play it on a laptop you are more than likely to have it perform well, as source engine is amazing and with the release of source 2 round the corner, it will hopefully beat the amazing heights it has already set. The game consists of a couple games officially run by Valve: arms race, demolition, deathmatch, bomb scenario and hostage rescue. Its small amount of games help keep a healthy income of players searching for maps however, this doesn\u0027t mean that the games stop there because there are a lot of fan made games like surfing of deathrun. The only downside I have discovered is its cases that slowly drain away your money in hopes of getting a \u0027red\u0027 or a \u0027knife\u0027. Putting all that aside I can\u0027t help but have fun with this game with its competitive but also casual nature.

You either get a headshot or you don\u0027t. Speaking of headshots, it\u0027s completely random where your bullets go, as the recoil is horribly designed. Even if your crosshair is perfectly centered on someone, even if they aren\u0027t moving, even if you aren\u0027t moving, even if there isn\u0027t ANY reason for you to miss, your bullet DODGES a foot to the left, right, or ANYWHERE you weren\u0027t aiming. Good gosh, I found I got more headshots by aiming at a person\u0027s CHEST than actually aiming at their HEAD. THIS MAKES NO SENSE. There is a serious lack of new content. It\u0027s basically a modded CS:S. There is only a handful of new weapons and maps. And now, the graphics. The graphics are simply terrible. The game looks 10 years old. The animations look stupid, the textures are low-res, and the lighting, oh the terrible lighting; all the maps look completely dull because of it. Almost all shadows have the same boring shade of grey. It\u0027s as if someone forgot to add proper lighting to most areas. Maps like cs_militia arguably look worse than they did in CS:S, back in 2004. The sound design is odd. For some reason, they\u0027ve mixed the low quality weapon sounds from the previous games with new, high quality sounds. The result does not sound realistic, or appealing. The \u0027having your knife out makes you run faster\u0027 thing is really stupid. Oh, and one last thing: Why is there an in-game marketplace where you can spend REAL MONEY on weapon skins? Are you telling me they spent time on making cosmetic items so that they could charge cash for them, instead of, oh I don\u0027t know, making a decent game? There are items that cost hundreds of dollars, They don\u0027t even do anything to affect gameplay, they\u0027re just for looks. This is not a F2P game. It costs $15, and they seriously charge extra money for lame weapon skins. Despite the above, the game can (sometimes) still be fun. It\u0027s just an overall mediocre game. It really isn\u0027t worth $15, so wait for a sale if you buy it at all.… Expand",

Cons:I have to say it though even with all that good stuff, it still wasn\u0027t that good of an update I mean they brought in the over powered r8, they messed with my favorite guns spray pattern (where the bullets land if you fire more than once) and shortly followed ranking system reset(not literally but pretty much). My experience:Roughly dec. 11 2015. I was just playing the game just like I usually do just playing with my friends when, bam we were hit with the update, and at the start we were all excited and stuff. When we realized what was going to happen, it was too late. After reading seeing what was going to happen to our favorite weapon the m4a1-s we were discussing but we didn\u0027t stop playing. Continued:So the first and second day of the update left the game broke with the r8 revolver, it was just to OP. But soon just about the 14th they fixed it, and balance was somewhat returned, other than the fact that valve still had the spray changes and hadn\u0027t fixed the voice chat. After that not much else important had happened. Ending:An overall conclusion as it stands now after the winter update is, it’s pretty good there’s still a problem or two, but that\u0027s to be expected.… Expand",

So what are interesting and new in CS:GO ??? “Realism”: - When pistols 300 and 500 coins price (P250 and Five-seven) instantly kills man with helmet and armor at close range with a single bullet head shot, and a device price 3100 (M4) does not kills man with helmet and armor at any distance with head shot. - Snipers with SSG 08 kills enemy in jump (!) with a sniper rifle (!!). And it\u0027s not a luck / random - this is the norm in the CS:GO. - Snipers with the AWP that can walk in different directions with 8 kilo rifle with active scope and make kills. This is the norm in the CS:GO. At some 5x5 games number of AWP is 3 or 4 in team. (VALVE ignore players request make AWP like in 1.6 version). - Some \"brilliant mind\" in VALVE decides add to balanced CS game ... revolver what has same damage like AWP. About 3 years passed from creation, VALVE dont understand, that CS is not just a first person shooter like Half - Life, this a balanced tactic game. - Shooting in the game is completely different from version 1.6. Greatly simplified shoot from AWP. Greatly had reduced the accuracy of the AK-47, M4. Similar to the parameters M4 from 1.6 became M4A1-S added later, with even then it fixed by removing the damage. In CS:GO combat is now spray control from both sides, as at amateur and at pro levels. The question arises - why not just transfer the weapons and they parameters from 1.6 to CS:GO??? - Armor piercing .... not bullets, in CS:GO we have armor piercing guns) Game “drop” and “funny” crates - When you play 1300 hours 10-15$ price game and had only consumer and industrial drop items. ONLY. In free to play Dota 2 drop any types of items. Before summer 2015 patch if you played many time, sometimes you may had 1 or 2 drop every day and many crates. But in summer 2015 some “genius” in VALVE decide to “improve” in CS:GO \"funny\" patch: now NO MATTER how many you play: 5 or 125 hours per week – all players have fixed drop – 1 gun skin, and 3-4 crates per week. In all different games are bonuses for players who play many time. CS:GO unique game where NO MATTER how many time players spend in game for items drop. - When you open 300 crates, and find ... 1 knife. “Progressive” rank system at 5x5 mod. - Nobody knows how it work) - You with friend bought CS:GO and decide to play 5x5 mod together? Don\u0027t hurry: if you have more higher rank that you friend has, you and friend ... can not play together, only 5 man can play having different ranks. If you do not have 5 players - you may never play together. CS:GO is unique game - if you bought game, not a fact, that you will play together 5x5 mod. - This system creates a people who really make CS:GO game ugly: -guys after account rank boosting (they pay to other player, and he boost rank) Guys after account rank boosting quite easy to calculate: for example, while playing kid with rank master guardian elite voice the kid 10 years old asks \"guys what is “eco round?”\"; when the guy with the rank gold nova master plays ONLY PP Bizon /no armor; when a person with a rank legendary eagle playing with the same ranks as he has finished 0/2/24. How many games have been marred by such friends \"after the boost\" is not counted. - \"smurf\" - man who has a high rank, and creates a new account for fun/after the ban or for account rank boosting for other player) Of course there will be little pleasant when the map where plays silver rank players comes Smurf with real rank legendary eagle, especially for the team against whom it came. The most interesting is that the account boosting is quite a legitimate thing. Nobody cares that it may spoil the game for many people. For these problems has only one simple solution – hide the rank, for only game system can check you rank. Smurfs and guys after account boost will disappear forever. I don\u0027t believe that VALVE can not make this simple solutions since 2012. \"Super\" anti cheat protects all VALVE servers)) - ban cheaters after... 2-3 months game. (or don\u0027t ban in general) - VALVE agree that they have a useless anti cheat, and created Overwatch - option, where any player after 150 wins at 5x5 mod can \"judge\" cheaters. They don\u0027t create new normal anti cheat, they decide transmit all responsibility fight with cheaters on to players. Other VALVE “great” idea. Awful game optimization. Don\u0027t be surprised, when you play Battlefield 4 in ultra quality graphics without any lags, but when You playing CS:GO in low quality graphics - game lags/ has freeze. Awful CS:GO official VALVE servers. Veterans of the CS serie do not need to tell what it means to play on the server where tickrate, updaterate, cmdrate is 64. \"friendly\" CS:GO community. - you play \"5x5\" mod. Taking first place with 4 russians in team all time uses foul language (want report them for this? no sense, because VALVE don\u0027t ban players for use foul language), and at last win round they....kick you. - kids screaming at microphone like a group of baboons. In summary we can say that the new game in the series has turned out an extraordinary, with its pluses and GREAT minuses. 100% i can say, if i knew all those minuses before start playing CS:GO , i never started play CS:GO. CS:GO - really worst game at all serie. Play CS:GO if you want spend some time playing with friends 5x5 just for fun. Play CS:GO if you don\u0027t upsets when you will be killed in the pit by jumping sniper from A plant (dust2 map). Play CS:GO if you don\u0027t upsets any game results. Play CS:GO if you don\u0027t care about awful game community. Play CS:GO if you don\u0027t care about game realism. Play CS:GO if you don\u0027t care about weapon skins and game items drop. Play CS:GO if you don\u0027t upsets cheaters playing versus you. 0/10… Expand",

There are some little improvements that could be placed and problems that could be fixed, which are more technical like hackers and gun physics. Otherwise this game is such a great tactical shooter, with so much communication involved with teammates and strategy especially in higher levels of gameplay. Skill is needed to be able to aim accurately, and my favorite mechanic of this game is spraying. Valve made this game less gunning and more aiming, which I really like. One of the best competitive games I\u0027ll be playing in a while with a higher learning curve than other FPS games. When you become a good player it feels so satisfying to destroy.… Expand",

It was my social hub, my iTunes visualizer, and my brief entryway into game design (which didn’t go very far.) It is and remains a standout multiplayer shooter that paved the way for things to come with Call of Duty and Battlefield. Being eight years since the excellent Source remake, Valve has decided it’s time to give the game another facelift. What started as a Source port for consoles became a more ambitious project that included PC. While there are no radical departures in Global Offensive, it is without a doubt a reboot. Valve has just hit the reset button on the series, once again. As drastic and premature of a maneuver it may be, there is no denying that Counter-Strike remains an addictive and rewarding competitive shooter like no other.… Expand",

WRONG! In 2016 Valve added another \u0027\u0027feature\u0027\u0027 called \"Prime Mathmakīng\". you simply add your phone number to your account and then you can only play against other prime members. prime was made to eliminate people\u0027s second accounts used for hacking and smurfing. (smurfing is when you purposefully de rank your account so you can play against people worse than you, scumbag thing to do in my opinion but all to their own.) The only problem is you have to be level 21 to use prime. so, since everyone else has prime it takes FOREVER to find a match and when you do... YOU HAVE TO GO AGAINST THE HACKERS AND SMURFS THEY\u0027RE TRYING TO GET RID OF. Valve treats new players like how they treat cheaters.

With 100s of hours on this game and previous installments, it is safe to say that CS GO is just as good as providing a competitive and fun experience as 1.6 and source did. One thing I love about the Counter Strike shooter genre at once is the sheer amount of skill required, you cant simply jump into a kill a wreck havoc, you must be able to learn spray patterns, smoke areas, and have a good amount of game sense, in most games the map doesn\u0027t make much of a difference towards the gameplay. But Counter Strike: Global Offensive provides a substantial amount of game sense, map knowledge, and gun spray patterns in order to just get the simplest of objective done. The ranks add more gameplay and less repetitive, not only is it fun to say \"IM Master Guardian 2\" but its also a good way to separate different skill groups. Ranging from the Beginning of Silver to all the way to Global Elite. One incredible feature that is new to Counter Strike is the addition of Workshop. You are able to download maps, gamemodes and also post skin ideas! Awesome way to add value and replay ability to the game! The map balance is a bit screwed up on a few maps, but with a good team you can achieve anything. However not every game is perfect, especially Counter Strike, unfortunately valve really decided to start off with new micro-dlcs. With the recent CSGO Betting scandals. Valves reputation has went lower then it should be. However there is a way to get these micro-dlcs without paying. You can get pretty **** drops when you rank up. The recent addition of spray cans is the worst of the worst. I hate seeing them in my drops as they have no value at all and could have been in the game since the beginning, worst way to charge players. The verdict is Counter Strike: Global Offensive is just as fun as it was in the past, with new features to give it better replay ability, I think this game shines out to be one of the most played and competitive and fun video games even after 4 years; And that\u0027s not easy to say, especially for shooters. The cons can be easily ignored, as they dont provide any substantial benefit in the game, and are just cosmetics. Overall I give CSGO a 9. Its fun and amazing with the exception of Micro-DLC. Pros: Upgraded Graphics Fun Competitive Scene New Features Good rank system Awesome Workshop Content 100% replay ability Lots of Skill Required Cons: Annoying Micro-DLC\u0027s… Expand",

Skins may be the most popular part of CS:GO, just like the hats in TF2, however can cause graphics problems. Rendering, dropping frames, it often can affect it. But the worst about skins is it\u0027s used for gambling. Yes, the CS:GO gambling is a real problem. And the second con is the updates that is coming out. It has BEEN A LONG TIME since the last operation, but even worse, some updates actually cause performance issues. IN conclusion, if you have a good PC and a pocketfull of $$$, then CS:GO is an excellent game to try. Otherwise, just go play CoD or BF.… Expand",

VAC совершенно ужасный, читы выявляет только ну очень глупых людей, которые в начале раунда убивают сразу пятерых в голову с респа. Не глупо ли это? С точки зрения Valve это очень прибыльно, так как в игре присутствует \"Патруль\" - игроки, наигравшие определённое количество часов и имеющие определённые звания, которые смотрят демку и определяют читер ли игрок или нет. И вот человеческий фактор может сыграть на руку читерам. Если один раз игрока забанили, то он может купить игру на другом аккаунте ещё раз и попробовать играть более скрытно. Таких игроков огромное количество и деньги с продаж соответственно капают в кошелёк Гейба. Именно поэтому никто не делает нормальный VAC и появилось огромное количество читеров.

Однако, с СЅ:Go на каждой карте изменения в модели, который не так уж и плохо само по себе, однако на некоторых картах модели настолько близки по цвету, Вы не можете их отличить от любой разумной дистанции, после чего у меня при наведении на игрока, чтобы выяснить, являются ли они на моей стороне или нет....очень неприятно!!!! 4) крест-волос - мне нравится старый сечения волос, однако я попытался использовать его, и это казалось бесполезной, так что теперь я должен использовать ту мерзость, что это \"новый\" крест-волос.

This brings forth a few limitations which are expected from a game engine which was first released in mid-2004. The game itself has gone through several iterations after its release in august of 2012. Even with these updates which have had the aim of balancing the in-game mechanics to make it a fair, competitive game, which has a strong e-sports scene, the core game itself does still have some flaws, which primarily come from its dated engine. The first major flaw in my opinion, is the hit registry. There have been countless moments in my time playing the game where there have been discrepancies of varying degrees of severity where the shot that I took according to what I saw on the client side and the server side registry haven’t quite lined up, with the most severe of these consisting of the client side registry showing that I shot the other player in the chest, but the discrepancy between client and server was so great, that when I watched the demo of my gameplay as seen by the server, missed by several body widths. This was most likely caused by the lag compensation that is iterated into the servers by valve with the aim of making CS:GO a fair and balanced game. In my opinion, the lag compensation is a bit too extreme at the moment, especially with the previously recalled shot being against a player with a similar ping to my own connection. CS:GO also has an anti-cheat system in place, which doesn’t appear to be too effective, as on average, out of every 100 games that I have played, there has been at least one player using third-party programmes to gain the upper hand in ~ 10-15% of the matches. Valves anti-cheat engine is supposed to automatically detect these programmes and ban the convicted player after an unannounced period of time, but after talking to several of these players, they told me in confidence that they had been using these unfair programmes for several months and in some more severe cases, for 2-3 years. This brought it to my attention that the VAC (Valve anti-cheat) system in place does not do enough to deter players from cheating, especially as those that do get caught by the system and do get banned are only banned on a per-account basis and can quite easily set up a new account and purchase CS:GO again and continue to cheat. A quite severe amount of the community of millions of players also have a varying degree of toxicity, with cases ranging from normal trash-talk up to much more severe cases, which include people sending other players death threats for reasons as trivial as not taking the game as seriously as the offender wants them to do. I have had first-hand experience of the more severe cases of toxicity, including one player sending me a death threat for the trivial reason of simply missing a shot that cost my team a round of a competitive match, despite that our team had an unsurmountable lead on the opponents. Despite all of these flaws that naturally come from an aging game engine and an audience of players that reside in all areas of the world, CS:GO does have its good points, including the steep learning curve that comes from all of the individual weapons in the game having their own recoil patterns that are relatively easy to learn, but hard to master. This does bring a case of elitism in the higher competitive ranks that is a natural part of any aspect of life that has people reaching high places and not liking the fact of that other people can reach the same goal with less effort. Overall. Counter Strike: Global Offensive is a great challenge for players whom are both new to, or experienced in the genre that is First-person shooters, with a great deal to learn about the games internal mechanics, despite of the flaws that come from a 13 year old game engine.… Expand",

Besides, there are plenty of community servers with different game modes that can be really enjoyable to anybody with friends.

Mechanically, CS:GO is a multiplayer first-person shooter (FPS). The main game of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive pits two teams, terrorists and counter-terrorists, against each other. To win, the terrorists have two win conditions: plant the bomb at one of two bombsites and successfully detonate it or kill all of the counter-terrorists. Conversely, the counter-terrorists have three win conditions: defuse the planted bomb, kill all of the terrorists, or the timer ends before the terrorists meet one of their win conditions. The first team to meet their win condition wins the round. Each round is one minute and 45 seconds. Teams switch sides (terrorists switch to counter-terrorist side, and vice versa) after 15 rounds. The first team to win 16 rounds out of 30 wins the game. If the score reaches 15-15, the game ends in a draw, unless you are playing on non-Valve servers where a 15-15 scoreline may lead to an overtime. CS:GO has many weapons used for different situations depending on what weapons the other team has, economic status, and strategy. A variety of grenades can be used to gain an advantage such as decoys, smoke grenades, and flashbangs. These grenades are critical in developing strategies. Although the gameplay described in the previous paragraph is not all there is to CS:GO. With the Steam Workshop, there are an enormous number of user-generated maps and game modes. All of these are hosted on community servers. From surf, to bunnyhop, to gun-game, there are many different ways to enjoy CS:GO. In addition to the game itself, CS:GO’s esports scene also provides value. With fast-paced action and easy to understand gameplay, CS:GO is one of the best spectator esports. In 2013, Valve introduced the “majors”, which were Valve-sponsored tournaments for CS:GO with prize pools of $250,000, eventually becoming $1 million in 2016. Valve’s continued support for the esports scene brought it to the forefront of esports. ELEAGUE, a CS:GO league created and televised by TBS, debuted in 2016. CS:GO broke the Twitch record for single channel peak concurrent streams during the grand finals of the ELEAGUE Major: Boston 2018 with a total of 1.1 million concurrent viewers. Personally going to events like iBUYPOWER Masters and Dreamhack Austin, if you really love the game, the adrenaline and excitement is well worth the money of these events. With all of these factors, CS:GO has risen to the top ranks of esports. Visually, CS:GO aims for a realistic look. Maps in CS:GO explore many different environments from a nuclear power plant to a German castle. Weapons in CS:GO are based on real military/police weapons such as the AK-47, Desert Eagle, and Glock. Counter-terrorist character models are based on real counter-terrorist forces, such as GIGN, SAS, and SWAT. The audio for CS:GO follows the realistic theme. Gun and grenade noises are based on their real-life counterparts. Music in CS:GO are drum-heavy and with brass instruments, contributing to a military aesthetic. From my own experience in meeting players and playing matchmaking, most players are male. Males represent a majority of professional CS:GO players. If you do play the competitive mode, I recommend ranking up so that you can have “Prime Matchmaking” which greatly reduces the chances of being matched with cheaters or toxic players, allowing for a much better experience. CS:GO, being a multiplayer-only video game, lacks what is traditionally considered a narrative. There are no “story levels”, plot, nor characters in the traditional sense. Nobody would call CS:GO a narrative video game. However, with players as the cast of characters, maps as settings, and player actions forming the plot, there is a narrative to be told with every match of CS:GO. Given the type of game CS:GO is, there are risks associated with playing it. CS:GO is typically viewed as a “violent video game”, that moniker carries with it stigma of causing aggressive behavior. With recent news stories about esports gambling, CS:GO is a prime target for accusations of fostering underaged gambling and gambling addiction. I do not believe that CS:GO, or any video game for that matter, makes people more aggressive but I do believe CS:GO can be a gateway into gambling With all of these facets, CS:GO has a very broad appeal. Whether you play games casually, competitively, enjoy watching esports, developing maps, or dabbling in some “healthy” gambling, CS:GO has a lot to offer. At a price point of $15, dropping even lower during Steam sales, CS:GO is easily worth its asking price.… Expand",

Flashing for teammates, trade killing, and smoke line-ups bring a full multiplayer experience with a bunch of depth for however far a player wants to go with the game. The economy system further allows for strategy: do you want that smoke grenade or a helmet? Do you risk buying a pistol this round so you cant buy a full utility the next round? All this makes an engaging experience. A 2 minute round timer ensures that players are regularly aggressive and encourages to take bomb sites by force.

There are not a lot of glitches I have experienced in my 300 hours of playing. Its a good game but totally not perfect. 7/10",

CS:GO has competitive skill groups, ranging from throwers and bad players down in the low Silver ranks, and the best players in the world at the highest ranks (Supreme Master First Class and The Global Elite). This game is the example of what a hardcore, top-tier skill ceiling, eSports-level competitive game should look like. The lowest level of members on tier-2 teams are incredibly gifted individuals with thousands of hours poured into the game. The gameplay is balanced, marginal luck is involved, it doesn\u0027t have micro-transactions that influence gameplay. It is the top FPS eSport (if you don\u0027t count Fortnite or PUBG, both of which are dying games and are not first-person-shooters) and (now) has more and more players coming back to play it. CSGO as a casual game was in its prime in 2016, but CSGO as a competitive game is at an all time high. If you\u0027re not into competitive shooters, then CSGO is not the game for you.

Very often you have to play with players below the average level, and this is not less than 70% of all players. That only there is a mode \"Competition\" ... Players prop up each other, with the whole team run in one direction, forgetting that there are two more. For the sake of cheerfulness I can kick you, and you are given a ban for it, at least 24 hours (24 hours, not 4, not 8, not 16, but 24), saying \"you are often excluded\". Physics is disgusting, when throwing a grenade in motion, it can fly ANYWHERE, but not where you throw it. The spread of weapons is HUGE, even on accurate trunks! You can release 20 cartridges (for example from M16) to the enemy, get 5, one of them to the head and not kill the enemy (which is strange)! But he is shooting with AK (the machine that is the most oblique, both in real life and in the game) will hit you in the head and kill from the first hit, although it can be seen on the repetition that he holds it ABOVE my head from slopes to the side at half a meter. There are a lot of curved maps that give an advantage to either special forces or terrorists. The cost of the same in the characteristics of weapons are different. As an example (I will not even give an example of M16-3100 and AK-2700), I\u0027ll give the \"Fire Grenade\" - for special forces - 600, for terrorists - 400. Where obviously the special forces lose, not to mention the demining set.

Comparing to old versions of Cs, this one is a bit different. We have the whole new map pool, which based on the architecture of some old maps, but in the new level of graphic quality. Brand new Cs have a lot of things that Valve putted so much effort in, such as the new look for characters, new buy menu with circle shape. Everything from old game have been replaced by a high quality objects. Smoke, flash and grenade have been changed with a new look, more realistic. As usually, all the idea about maps, characters and guns are based on real life destination, real things and people. Texture, effect and sound are better than the old versions. In my opinion, I feel it easier to hear the sound of grenade when it came out, more clearly footsteps. Gameplay is really good, for people love Cs they will feel amazing when the gameplay do not have much change and they can easy to play as they used to do with the old version. They added more mode such as demolistion and arm race, more relaxing mode for online player to relax after ranking game. Brand new ranks for Csgo was created. You need to have 10 win games to display your skill rank, I think this rank system used to be very good when it is very accurate. But in 2018, match making systems are so bad, one because of hacking issue, two is about how system arrange group of people. Voice chat also on the game, make people can communicate better. The most developed thing is multiplayer. In 2018, Csgo is one of the best eSports game of all time with nearly 300 tournaments in 1 year. Price pool for 1 officially tournament is up to 150.000$. A lot of people contributed to make this game become a way better than other eSports game. I can say football and CSGO nowadays have the same industry, when they paid professional player and teams very good salary. Some people change their life when they play CSGO. Football have bet systems, CSGO also. Football have manager and sponsor, CSGO have it too. When talking about CSGO, they put more attention on how CSGO change life, lots people don’t care about gameplay and error or issues of the game, they are still play it for better ranked and some for money. Valve also just give CSGO less effort. Even there was a lot of issue but most of pro team still training it every day, from that we can know how CSGO change people life, make it become a real job . Overall, CSGO is not just a game, it is life for lots of people. Valve have created a good game, nice changed from older version that still make CS lover want to purchase. How Valve run their CS community actually make me impresss.… Expand",

But it\u0027s still far from a perfect game. it has some flaws. while some can be seen trough, most of them really affect the gameplay. For example, there is no real sense of progression in the game besides a ranking system only meant to match you with players of matching your skill levels. Which can be exploited by so-called \"smurfs\". These smurfs are highly skilled players that try to get a low rank ( often on a second account). The game will then match them with people with that low rank. I haven\u0027t encountered a lot of smurfs, maybe like 2 or 3 in my 500 hours playing this game. (at least that I remember) but a lot of people are reporting problems about this issue. Another thing is that it seems ( at least to me ) that Valve is far more eager to create new loot boxes/ crates for the game instead of actual new content. If you could compare how many times a skin related update or a gameplay related update got released. There would be alot more skin related. The anti-cheat of this game sometimes seems non-existent. The game has a HUGE cheater community. Even youtubers that make videos only about their new cheats etc. the game is full of \u0027em. That doesn\u0027t mean Valve hasn\u0027t come up with something to go against this problem. \"Prime matchmaking\" is what its called. What it will do is match you against other players with this option turned on. the catch is you can immediately turn this option on. you have to have a lot of hours and experience with the game before the option granted to you. which makes new innocent players vulnerable.. Now let\u0027s get to why I love this game! The intensity, the competitive feeling I just love it! sometimes you go full tactical mode with your friends calling out everything you see. and sometimes you will just buy the **** SMG in the game and rush the enemy team hoping for a win. it\u0027s just a lot of fun. The amount of fun you will be having will be determined by how seriously you will take the game. if you can\u0027t stand to lose. stay far FAR away from this game. This game\u0027s community can vary a lot from where you\u0027re located. At least for me, they haven\u0027t been too toxic. Some bad apples but you\u0027ll find that in any game.

What I was expecting to play were Zombie mode, Those skate things, free hosting servers and no battle camping royale but not all of them are there. What I dislike about this game are -Their server\u0027s giving laggers an advantage who are hard to shoot because of their lag -Battle Royale mode which I need a lot of Explosives to make those campers stop camping in the building and get out so I can kill them or they\u0027ll blow up into pieces which I still killed them. -Cheaters in casual which doesn\u0027t blind the players who are already killed and is spectating the game keeps chatting or voice chatting or screen sharing their spectate. -Hackers who does aimbots, wall hacks and other hacks that improves their gameplay with no skill involved. I THOUGHT STEAM FIXED THAT WITH THEIR MONEY?! This game failed, play a different game. That\u0027s why it\u0027s free to play I hope they\u0027re done milking the battle royale mode so they\u0027ll start milking the zombie mode except there are copy righted music in the zombie mode that\u0027s why they never milked it.… Expand",

There are reasons for the Global Offensive popularity - 1. Steam got more popular 2. Player base is getting stronger each year 3. This game is overhyped by YouTube, Twitch and other internet sources. But the game itself is no better than Counter-Strike Source, which is really disappointing, considering that GO was released in 2012, 8 (!) years after CS Source, but didn\u0027t bring much improvement, aside from some weapons, game modes, and other small features. But the maps, gameplay, and even graphics didn\u0027t really change much, compare to Source. In late 2018, a lot of problems only got worse, the main problems are: 1. Cheaters. VAC is trying to fight them, but not to a needed extent. And there are A LOT of cheaters nowadays, because the game became freemium2. Toxic community. GO is the part of the series with the most toxic community I\u0027ve encountered in all CS games. Not everyone is bad, but you will find a lot of toxic players 3. Shady gambling and trading schemes 4. Extensive monetization So the game now is worse than is was in 2013-2014, and due to freemium mode all listed and other problems in the game will only get worse. I hope Valve will do something about it, before it\u0027s too late.… Expand",

The biggest issues conceived are caused by player mischief and some features we\u0027ve grown to love in the past such as spray painting are integrated, however not as free anymore.",

The skill-cap on this game is very high and I respect people which have put their dedication into mastering this game. The problem with it in my book is that the game is too unforgiving. I know that being unforgiving is a very appealing trait for a lot of people, but I think it\u0027s just not what I seek in my games. I like having brutal mechanics in single-player games more, as in that scenario the blame can not be put on your teammates, but on the game. The brutal unforgiving nature of CS:GO unfortunately just makes the entire community a toxic crater of cancer, which makes it only really fun to play with a 5-man.

I played non-stop competitive CS:Source in regional championships, LANs, and online leagues; and won 4 regional championships with some LAN placings. Here\u0027s what I have to say about GO... CSGO is awesome, Valve delivered here in the end. When it was released, yeah, it wasn\u0027t anything special, just a pretty CS:Source. But now we have amazing gun skins, stickers, awesome knives, intense major tournaments, souvenir packages, bracket prediction challenges, seasonal operations with extra maps and challenges for even more drops, etc. It\u0027s awesome, it\u0027s a great game to be a part of. Matchmaking and rated matchmaking based personal ELO rankings is a sweet way to keep competitive games close. It can never be perfect, but back in Source you had to wait in an IRC channel with a looped message playing until someone finally answered your loop and then it took them 20 minutes to get 5 in the server, etc. Basically with CS:Source whether you were trying to ring or you had your team it took between 20-60 minutes to get a scrim. Now it takes about 5. So, the fact that people still complain about it is beyond me. Game play wise, each CS as I know them (1.6, Source, GO) has been different beasts in terms of mechanics and recoil control. Lots of little things that made or broke you as a player in these games, but recoil control is one of the biggest. You often hear people scream “deathmatch deathmatch deathmatch, that\u0027s the only way to get better”. Well, quick point, how can you DM to practice when you don\u0027t know what your practicing? Best thing to do to understand the recoil patterns is load an offline game, kick the bots, and shoot at walls. Seriously. Shoot and spray at walls with various guns at various ranges with various movement patterns, that\u0027s the best way to understand how to control and use various guns. You need to understand each guns grouping patterns first before you can practice controlling them! About the community, yes, the flamers and trolls are alive and well. But here\u0027s the thing, I\u0027ve been around CS a long time, I\u0027ve won 4 regional championships with CS:Source, and really it never bothered me that sometimes the flamers are all you hear. Here\u0027s why. Once you play enough games (competitive or otherwise) you\u0027ll hear the same kind of person, it\u0027ll sound like this.. “you guys suck, why are you even playing this game?” or something similar if they are beating you. It sounds like this, “you\u0027re such a hacker, it\u0027s so obvious” when you beat them. The fact that people are so binary in their mentality amuses me personally, so I carry that over to CS flamers as well. Some people like to pretend they are perfect at the game, and everyone else around them is inferior, yet if you beat them you must be a hacker. It just sounds so stupid to even talk about it but seriously this is how a lot of people are about the game. Just don\u0027t let it get to you, there\u0027s no point. Don\u0027t even engage. And you wont have many problems. It\u0027s not the easiest game to pick up right off the bat. “Spray at feet, get headshot” is a notorious saying from outsiders about CS games, because CS can be amazingly random sometimes. And the round-by-round economy, buying guns and items every round, and recoil patterns make it a steep learning curve. But if you understand the groupings (I said how to above), read guides about strategy (like economy management, game flow), and just get in there and start playing you will see why people just can\u0027t stop playing this game! Counter-Strike was the world\u0027s original eSport. After the Championship Gaming Series went down the CS1.6 and CS:Source attention did as well, games like StarCraft and DOTA took to the forefront of competitive eSports soon after. But with the cases, skins, and major tournaments Valve and the CS community have turned CS:GO back into one of the world\u0027s premiere eSports and there\u0027s many, many reasons why it\u0027s succeeding. As I say, it\u0027s a very exciting game to be a part of right now.… Expand",

The best bit of this game, is the speed of engagement which results in very quick and tense confrontations, where often, a burst of fire ends in a winner, and tactics CAN help dramatically. The noise of your opponents(So turn off music and get decent head phones!) and the way various other aspects of the game work such as random scatter (aim) and grenades do compliment the game VERY WELL. If you know what your doing, you can use grenades to get through impossible situations or out-gun 5 people if your good enough. However, random aim can leave you feeling miserable sometimes, even with burst control... Generally the options for the guns are good... though it ain\u0027t Killing floor... see below CSGO is good, as mentioned make no mistake, however you need to take the following caveats into account that can make your game time MISERABLE - not unlike playing L4D2 on PvP. ( I think maybe why they sell prime match making nowadays LOL - but well this is FTP, so give em money for a decent game ) As the devs have corrected the 2 bottom points which are dev related, I will vote this up - but this still has issues with IZI / EZ noobs as described above. ( did not recommend this from my 500-1000 hours playing) I may have recommened this, but the issues below are a big deal and will STILL be a source of MISERY. ------------------------------------------- Details of the Woes of Misery: -Community of desperate to win players : NO SPORTSMAN-SHIP -Who SPAM HIGH END GUNS like: awp/XM1014/sgg58(Aug)(scope)/p90/SCAR CONSTANTLY ( the game does not really BALANCE to prevent it) -Who join games in GROUPS,ARTIFICIALLY LOSE for half the session and then brutally destroy the enemy team in the next 6 rounds – making UNFIXABLE BALANCE - this creates a cheesey un fun game and is pure misery. rejoning often takes you back to the same server... (keep leaving and rejoining may fix this) -The BAD BALANCE of the guns - money, even in casual doesn\u0027t restrict over use of high-end guns... -CHEESEY RANDOM AIM that allows people to hit you when they are not aiming at you. -Some guns have NO RANGE RESTRICTIONS - So get ready to be killed by an auto shotgun at range - although this emphasises the need for quick aiming (and luck ) to get head-shots (which stresses how game changing random aim becomes)(hence why the XM1014 is such an awful gun - it scatters so badly that you don\u0027t need to aim with it - and it fires in semi-auto mode D: ) Other minor issues -Arrangement and treating of less played maps putting newer or less played maps with maps like \u0027Mirage\u0027 and suggesting people don\u0027t want to play them(*sic). Most people just vote for \u0027Mirage\u0027 all the time... good thing you didn\u0027t add a replay map option to most votes :P NOTE : YOu can play these maps and many others on the custom servers - these maps will be rare on official servers as mentioned -which is a shame. No longer an issue?: revoked point : removal and simplification of maps i.e. Nuke and other maps were recently simplified... Why? : The updates are good, and new maps and updates are welcome. revoked point : Presence of an account analytical matchmaker system that I cannot get out of WHY? this was the case 2 years ago, but I have noticed prime matchmaking is a paid for update. So feel free to spend for this privilege - I\u0027m not sure if it applies any more - so dont hold me to it - please leave comment if I\u0027m wrong! I will correct!… Expand",

But until today Valve has not been able to do anything against the cheaters. And these run through the whole game, and in matchmaking you can often find cheaters. In addition, the whole Lagger came a while ago when it was decided to let other regions play with Europe (Russia, Saudi Arabia, parts of Asia etc.) Everyone should be aware that due to the distance and the possibly poor internet connection, Laggs will occur anyway. And in games like CS: GO, Laggs \u003d Cheats because depending on how strong an opponent is, they can not be hit and have clear advantages. But only money counts here, as long as players spend money on CS: GO Valve doesn\u0027t really care. For these reasons I can not recommend the game to anyone who does not like to play with cheaters and camps. If you don\u0027t care, CS: GO is a really good balanced (tactical) shooter.… Expand",

The game is good, but it has a lot of cheaters, also a bad community, mostly these are small schoolchildren who yell into the microphone. Sometimes it happens that the server does not count hits. For instance: 3 hit 30 damage. Also a rank system, it is far from ideal. For instance: 3 games won in a row And in the next lost game, they lower you.… Expand",

Also all the lootboxes are cosmetic, and you can buy them on a marketplace. This game also has a massive economy which you can invest in like a stock market. I bought 30 breakout cases for 6 cents each and then sold them later for 70 cents each. I have met a lot of \"nice\" people in the game along with some toxic people, but generally you friend a few hundred \"nice\" people and can get at least one person to play with whenever you want. I don\u0027t know why, but this game has a replayable magic to it, and the game is far from dead.… Expand",

Sure, playing online can be very difficult at the beginning(I am not very good too), but you can still have fun in modes like Arms Race. Excellent game overall.",
