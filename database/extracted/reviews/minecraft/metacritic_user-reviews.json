Minecraft is arguably the best value you can get from a game this generation. Minecraft somehow combines the addictive gameplay of Simcity and Resident Evil, not two games that normally go together. You start the game with no weapons or shelter, just a vast landscape consisting of different \u0027blocks\u0027 of materials that you can cut and shape into tools and building supplies. The only other creatures you see on your horizon (the gameworld is reported to be about eight times the size of the earth) are assorted animals such as pigs and cows. In the first few minutes of gameplay, you start to notice the sun moving across the sky, and it occurs to you that it will soon be getting dark. And this is where Minecraft can turn from a simple looking Lego game with cute quacking ducks into something that is about to scare the hell out of you. As darkness settles, you can see \u0027things\u0027 shuffle along the beach towards you, making growling noises. Arrows start flying at you from skeleton archers. It occurs to you that spending the afternoon and early evening exploring your world was possibly not the most productive use of your time. Building a shelter close to where you initially spawned is the first order of business. And this is where the \u0027mine\u0027 and \u0027craft\u0027 come in. By chopping down a tree with your hands, you can get wood. With wood you can create a workbench to make tools such as an pick, axe or sword. Once you have a pickaxe, you can tackle harder materials like stone or iron by digging into the earth or chipping away at cavern walls. And with these better materials, you can use your workbench to make stronger tools, weapons and armor. By the time the moon comes up on your first night, you won\u0027t have time to make an impregnable castle fortress, but at least you should be able to put up four walls and make a door, windows and roof. In the morning, the monsters that kept you a prisoner in your home at night burn up from the morning\u0027s sun, making it safe once again to explore. This when when you\u0027ll start to figure out that better materials are buried at deeper levels. And shortly after that, you\u0027ll realize that deep in your mine (or anywhere that lacks a light source) the monsters are waiting for you. There is genuine fear of being killed, because if you are it means you drop all of items you were holding, carrying or wearing at that spot, and you re-start at your initial spawn point that could be miles away, assuming you can even remember where that was. Minecraft offers addictive gameplay mixed with creativity. Later, as you progress through the game (there aren\u0027t any \u0027levels\u0027, you just craft better weapons and items) you can aid your exploring by making boats, a compass that always points toy your spawn area, a watch (so you know if it\u0027s dark when you emerge from your mine), even to a minecart rail system! With a strong sword and good armor, you\u0027re now able to defend yourself from *most* monsters (called MOBS), allowing you to focus on building whatever you want. I recommend you check out a few Youtube videos of what people with time and imagination can come up with. For really large projects, such as a life-size USS Enterprise... this is where the multiplayer aspect of the game really shines. Together, a group on a server can build entire cities. Players can download or create their own player skins to maintain a bit of style while swinging that diamond pick-axe to bore through tunnels that run under the ocean. Servers can chose to offer players any materials they need to aid in the construction. Again, check online to see just what is possible! Online games also allow you to build without fear of Mobs, which at that point really turns the game into a sim builder. The game also features different climates, so you might spend one day on a sunny beach, and the next hiking across a mountain through the snow. You can explore (and create) lava pools, waterfalls, and occasionally you\u0027ll stumble across dungeons. These have chests with loot in them, and a spawn cage that creates the Mobs (there\u0027s seven different ones, but I\u0027ve chosen not to mention one in particular that will eventually give you nightmares). Using torches that you create from wood sticks and coal (of course) keep you from being in the dark underground, and if you surround a Mob spawn cage with torchlight, it will remain safely dormant. Expect to lose yourself in this game for many, many hours. Minecraft (still in beta) is currently about $15, so get in while it\u0027s still half price. Beta simply means it\u0027s still under development, so items are constantly being added. Great value indeed!… ",

With a little thought, you can accomplish almost anything you want. The artistically inclined will certainly find a niche to fill somewhere in here. - The graphics. Testament to the fact that photo-realism need not be a requirement in today\u0027s game market. Those who prefer prettied-up games may avoid Minecraft for this reason. - Exploration. The game world is generated by complex algorithms which create stunning, completely unique formations on a whim. There\u0027s a sense of discovery here akin to that which was felt by European explorers when they first set sail to distant Atlantic islands all those years ago. - The monsters. The skeletons wielding bows, the zombies that inexplicably drop feathers, and the horrendous ghasts of the Nether are quirky, but fearsome. They\u0027re simple, effective antagonists. How many other games are best-known by an image of their villain? (Don\u0027t answer that, there\u0027s probably a lot!) - The mechanics. They\u0027re simple, and (for the most part) make sense. Building, crafting, and mining are handled in a way that makes even the most laborious of tasks seem interesting. Never before have I kept playing a game after digging into a dark, clammy cave, getting knocked off of a ledge by a green ball of slime, falling into lava, and losing everything in my inventory. - The music. C418\u0027s small, simple melodies fit perfectly into the world of Minecraft- doing well to characterize the game\u0027s attitude with itself and to create dissonance and assonance with in-game events. The melody of a piano can be calming or frightening depending on what you\u0027re doing as you listen. Overall, Minecraft is a good fit for me. It\u0027s the sort of game I wish was made more often. It isn\u0027t harsh or in-your-face, trading the attitudes associated with most video games for those of board games or building blocks. It\u0027s a toy, meant to be enjoyed, not mastered. It\u0027s the best game I\u0027ve played in a long while.… ",

Let your imagination roam free, just make sure it\u0027s back by dark, always be back home by nightfall in Minecraft. The largest complaint I hear about this game is that the graphic are poor, I could not disagree more. Only the cobblestone texture is poor. Nonetheless, a remedy exists for all graphic centric people, this is called \"installing a texture pack\". Texture packs are commonly found on the popular Minecraft forums, and there is one for all sorts of tastes, though a nice one to find out what you think looks good in Minecraft is the Painterly Pack (http://painterlypack.net/). The website allows you to customize the various textures in Minecraft, there are at least for different texture options for any given block or item in the game. I highly recommend you buy this game, though don\u0027t be surprised if you fall prey to the \"Minecrack\" and stay up until 1 A.M. on your search for diamonds.… ",

The game gives you no hints or advice, so it is up to you to find out how to play the game and even there is no right of wrong answer. Personally I decided to build a big city just for myself and to finish it I called it: \"Casperville\" and crown myself king/dictator. I had a lot of fun for a while and unless you use a wikia site it will take roughly two months before you discovered all the different blocks and craftable items. Minecraft mostly involves building and if you want you can do that all day long, but once the sun goes down... all hell breaks loose. At night a whole army of monsters spawn and since you are rather tasty it won\u0027t take long until you are protagonist pie. You have the option to fight back, but if you choose to do so the terrible fighting engine will easily ead to your death. The only thing you can do is hold the attack-button and hope that the enemy will die before you do or one of his friends join in on the fun. The only weapon worth using is the bow because that is a ranged weapon and you will need it when facing off against the exploding creepers. Anyway, at dawn the zombies and skeletons burn to their death and the spiders become friendly again. After the Creepers finally left (and this will take quite a while) you can get back to whatever you were doing in the first place. The single player will keep you busy for quite a long time, but once that runs out of appeal you still have the multi player. If you erect a server with some of your pals or join a quality server the game will stay fun for years to come. Servers like Honor Craft have a great community and manage to keep the grievers out. Lastly I want to mention the amazing presentation. Love or hate the 16-bit graphics (personally I liked them due to nostalgia), but you got to love the world. Minecraft\u0027s world is gigantic and to my understanding it keeps creating more world if you come close to the end of it. The world has; vast seas, looming mountains and beautiful valleys. If you love untainted nature then Minecraft will feel like a paradise and if you don\u0027t you can always just burn it down and build factories on top of it. It also helps that Minecraft is still in production, so the game receives constant updates. The recent update for example added weather to the game. I can talk for hours about how beautiful Minecraft is, but I am sure you get it by now. The game looks amazing and offers a lot of content, but it does have some annoying flaws. The combat could be better and not having torches around when it\u0027s night is a **** but I am willing to look past that. This game was worth my fourteen euros and I advice you to try it out as well. You can play Minecraft for free on www.minecraft,net, but the premium version is much better.… ",

Minecraft is a sandbox construction game, inspired by Infiniminer, and created by Markus Persson, the founder of Mojang AB. The game involves players creating and destroying various types of blocks in a three dimensional environment. The player takes an avatar that can destroy or create blocks, forming fantastic structures, creations and artwork across the various multiplayer servers in multiple game modes. This game is highly liked by many people and has sold over 1 million copies. The graphics for minecraft are nothing special; however, I\u0027m pretty sure this was intended. The graphics aren\u0027t great at first glance, although you get used to it the more you play the game. The art design is quite charming and interesting, and it kindof sucks you in. I started liking the graphics as the pixel art design fits the game nicely however, die-hard graphics fans will never get used to them. The gameplay is simple and complex in different ways. You start off in a randomly-generated world and you need to survive as long as possible. The game involes you to gather resourses, make shelters and kill baddies. The game has many crafting recipes and this can be very rewarding. There is a bit of a learning curve, however, once you start to get the hang of things, you can\u0027t stop thinking what to make next. The building in this game is endless, with tons of materials to get. I found myself making houses and all sorts of things. Anyways, back to the \"survival\" aspect. The game\u0027s AI is quite good; as the badguys really try to kill you. Obviously, this can be turned off, but the game kinda loses it\u0027s spunk. There are many enemies, from zombies to spiders, there is tons to kill. The game has an online feature, however this is a big pain for people who are forced to make a server. Unforthunately, I didn\u0027t get a chance to play online, but I\u0027m quite sure it would be a lot of fun. I could sit here for hours telling you about how interesting this game is, but I\u0027ll let you try it out for yourself and expierience how great this game is. For a game that only costs $20, this is a must-buy for all PC owners. The sound effects in this game are realistic and somewhat creepy. The animals such as cows, pigs, and sheep sound spot on and really make the game come to life. The game\u0027s baddies sound weird, but that isn\u0027t to much of a factor. The game\u0027s music is somewhat relaxing and peaceful. Some of the music is excellent, and others are decent. Overall, the audio is fresh and is a blast to listen to. The controls are extremely responsive and customizable. I had very little control issues with this game. I don\u0027t have much to say here; except the fact that the controls are almost perfect. The game\u0027s replay value is the best I\u0027ve ever seen in a video game. The game edges LittleBigPlanet2 by using randomly-generated worlds, tons of items to craft, many updates to come and much more features. The game\u0027s replay value is unlimited, due to the fact of the cost, features and content. PROS: +Randomly-Generated Worlds +Tons to Explore +Excellent Controls +Great Music +Sound Effects are spot-on +Cost of $20 +Charming +Good AI +Decent Graphics CONS: -No Maps -Learning Curve -Online Setup is a pain Ratings: Graphics: 7.5/10 Gameplay: 9.5/10 Audio: 8.5/10 Controls: 9.5/10 Replay Value: 10/10 OVERALL: 9.0/10 To conclude, Minecraft is a stunning game. The graphics may not be for everyone, but that shouldn\u0027t judge the game completely. The gameplay and all the other features overpowered that flaw, and you get used to the graphics after awhile. For all the people who hate the graphics, download a texture pack to make the graphics better. I think this is one of the best games for the PC.… ",

Frequent updates and mods maintain the game\u0027s stunning replay value. The game is only â… ",

Creepers will run at you when they see you, and explode when they are about 3-4 blocks away from you, this is bad since the blast will destroy the sounding blocks (Your house?) Also since there is a day and night system which lasts 10 minutes for day, 7 for night, and 1.5 for sunrise/sunset. The graphics are terrible, but that\u0027s not the point, Notch (the creator\u0027s username) is looking for good game play, and is also trying not to make MineCraft non-repetitive, which is why the maps are randomly generated, this way you can find hidden tunnels, caves, and pieces of land that look just awesome.

And then Craft tools out of these elements to use against fighting zombies, building houses and generally advancing through the game! Firstly you a spawned at a random spot in an infinitely random world which is always one of a kind. Your primary objective on the first day is to build a shelter and make pretty basic tools to copinside with the onslaught of various amazing mobs that are coming your way at dusk. The mobs consist of Creepers- Exploding Green Penis looking things. Skeletons- which shoot a lot of arrows at you from the darkness Zombies- Which are err...Zombies and Spiders- Which are spiders. Most of these can be seen while you are adventuring the countless caverns that are laid randomly underneath your world!

There are those who complain about the graphics, but if those people can\u0027t get over the graphics and see this brilliant game is then I pity them. And the graphics aren\u0027t actually bad at all, they suit the game and are quite charming. Just the thrill of exploring a randomly generated world and finding all kinds of wonderful and peculiar things. And exploring the bowels of the earth, hunting for those elusive diamonds and always looking over your should lest a monster creep up on you. Multiplayer, though still in development, allows players to connect with their friends and build their dream house, castle, fort ,cave, or whatever they may wish. There are also those who would criticise the game\u0027s single developer, and we do need to remember that this game is made by one man, Notch works hard to produce this brilliant game, but if he decides that he doesn\u0027t want to patch the game, then the game is not patched, god forbid he should ever go on holiday. He may have established an office for Mojang, but it is simply so that he can surround himself with the greatest programming talent in Sweden. If you are even considering buying this game, then you definitely should. I held out for a while but when I finally played this game, I was hooked from the very beginning. For the price it\u0027s at it is great value. This is definitely the best indie game that I have played in a long, long time, and at a price that wont break the bank.… ",

The graphics seem poor, but add to the charm. You start off in an empty world, inhabited only by animals. As you explore this vast world, you collect the resources needed to build your first shelter, perhaps a bed as well. As the night falls upon your world, the creatures of the night come out with only the intent of killing you. Past this first night, you return outside to collect more resources. This day, you decide, will be the day that you craft your first set of armor. Or maybe it\u0027s the day you first begin your expedition into the depths of the world to uncover more valuable ores. Whichever you choose, the ambient of the world gives you a sense of loneliness, but then the wonderful and peaceful music comes in and you realize that you are not alone, no, instead you are at peace with your surroundings. As you delve into the depths, you encounter dungeons and lava. The darkness surrounds you making torches a necessity. You keep traveling through the natural cave systems, breaking down walls with your pick until you find what you\u0027ve been looking for. This simple gem represents the entirety of your struggles through your world. These diamonds will allow you to craft the most powerful tools possible. With these diamond tools, you begin to harvest obsidian. You craft some flint and steel and get to work building a portal. As you light that portal for the first time, excitement runs through you. You step into the portal and are transported to a new world, a world full of flame and lava. Where the creatures are deadlier. You have arrived in the nether. This place can be used as a way to quickly travel around the surface world, or can be used to gather strange new blocks. But soon even this place grows boring. Once you arrive at stability, with a constant source of resources that you can gather with ease, the game becomes less of an adventure. Now that you have all that you could want, all that is left is to build. You can build anything. Your mind\u0027s eye sees this world as a canvas, your blocks as the paint. You build structure upon structure, bringing your world to life. You have farms full of wheat, a dense forest with mushrooms covering the ground, a small village, perhaps a castle with a moat, your mine shafts. And now, you step back and look at your expansive creation. You marvel at your handiwork, despite a few flaws that you see. And then you realize how much time you have spent in this world. Hours upon hours, seemingly wasted. But you must remember; Time you enjoy wasting, isn\u0027t time wasted. Minecraft is a simple game, a game that is only as incredible as you can make it. The game is constantly being expanded with content updates, the Multiplayer allows you to experience this vast world with your friends. If there is one thing that Minecraft is not, that is that this is not the game for those who lack imagination.

People these days don\u0027t seem to have any fondness of charming things and would rather up their K/D ratio. Minecraft is anything but pointless. You have to create your OWN fun. \"What\u0027s that? The developers were too lazy to make the fun for you? DRAMATIC GASP!\" Wrong, they have supplied you with an extremely hearty amount of extremely hearty things that you can have an extremely hearty amount of fun with. If you wanted to, you could: Build, anything from an underground troll hole to the most freakin\u0027 awe-inspiring cathedral to ever grace the virtual (ore real) world; Mine, in a randomly-generated world where you can destroy, pickup and change EVERYTHING, the world is your\u0027s to sculpt; Create, fantastic contraptions using a special electricity-conducting ore called Redstone to power block-moving pistons, music-making note blocks, noob-pwning traps (one guy even made a functioning computer the size of a continent!); Craft; using an intuitive crafting system, craft things by forming the general shape of the tool with the items you have; Explore, there\u0027s fantastic cloud-raping mountains and dark scary caves with monsters waiting for you to find them, there\u0027s even an alternate hell dimension for you to conquer!… ",

That said, Minecraft has captured the essence of sandbox gaming. So far the features have been more abstract than concrete giving players tools to explore and shape the world without imposing any sort of virtual reality other than the one they create. This may change in the future, Terraria has named bosses and the team at Mojang have expressed an interest in doing something similar in Minecraft. However, so far I like the way the team has implemented the game so I suspect they will add more concrete concepts in elegant ways. If you even think you may like this game, pick it up and/or check out the many videos people have posted on YouTube… ",

It\u0027s more like phenomenon. I can not really imagine person which has not heard of Minecraft. So far millions of people played it. I have watched it since January 2010 and first played it in November 2010. I have watched all the process of constructing and upgrading the game, and I guess I was one of the first thousand Poles who bought it. With this knowledge, i can really say it: alpha 1.2.6 was the best part of Minecraft, and it would deserve 10. But since then, adding incomplete stuff and ruining it\u0027s point have ruined it\u0027s final score, too. But, even therefore there\u0027s so many stupid and incomplete stuff (NPC\u0027s, villages, etc. etc.) I love it. I love it the damn outta it. It really is not a game; you can not say \"Minecraft has bored me, I am leaving\". You just open it sometimes and play. It\u0027s not like \"I like it\" or \"I don\u0027t like it\", since it\u0027s YOUR game. You decide what are you doing in your fantastic, randomly generated world and your own decision is, what you\u0027ll build, and what will you see. You can build, you can discover or you can kill everything in sight. Whatever you choose, it\u0027s your game and even if you don\u0027t like building, you can for example go and look for dungeons, and vice versa. It can never make you bored as if you\u0027ll get bored of something, you can always make something different. The point of my score (9 out of 10) is just because of Notch\u0027s decision to make it more RPG like than sandbox like. Yeah, you still can ignore villages and strongholds and keep building, but still it makes me feel like I\u0027m playing incomplete Diablo clone than 100% complete, full and enjoyable sandbox game. I enjoyed 1.2.6 alpha more, but 1.0.0 release is still, by far, the most enjoyable game... ever made? Maybe. That\u0027s because the possibilities are endless. If I\u0027ll ever get bored of this game... I\u0027ll do something else in my beautiful world. Funny, how 9 out of 10 game is more enjoyable than games I\u0027ve rated 10. And I feel really bad of having incomplete game as the release version. But now... back to my mine.… ",

InMinecraft has been an insanely popular first person sandbox ever since it gained mainstream popularity, during it\u0027s Alpha and Beta releases. Now with the final version out, a review can be done. The graphical style of Minecraft is pretty inspired by retro games, what with it\u0027s emphasis on blocks. It won\u0027t require the holiest of graphics cards, but that doesn\u0027t mean the game looks bad. In fact, the game can prove that good graphics aren\u0027t needed to make a beautiful looking game. You start off each world with three modes; Survival, Creative and Hardcore. Survival tasks you with surviving the world of Minecraft and progressing through a very light \u0027campaign\u0027. It is more survival like than it\u0027s biggest rival Terraria, but don\u0027t expect to go all Bear Grylls. Hardcore Mode, however, tasks you with surviving even more than Survival; you get one life (meaning once you die, the world gets deleted, almost similar to Terraria) and you are stuck on the hardest difficulty. Creative is where Minecraft can show it\u0027s true colours. Creative Mode gives you all the items available in the game (with an infinite supply), unlimited health and the ability to fly and destroy blocks with one hit. Minecraft has shown that the possibilities of what you can do are almost endless. You can make anything from a 1:1 scale, fully functional space-ship, to pixel art of Rainbow Dash. There is also a very heavy modding scene in the game, with custom maps, texture packs and even mods that add more features to the game. However, the game isn\u0027t without it\u0027s faults. Unless you give yourself a goal, the game could turn out getting stale after a while. There\u0027s only so many times one can venture into a dungeon and have an epic battle with spiders. Also, the game still feels like a beta. A late beta, but a beta nonetheless. Multiplayer isn\u0027t polished yet and don\u0027t expect the single player experience to be flawless. Despite this, Minecraft is worth your time, if you have any. At almost Â£17, it can seem a bit steep for what you get initially, but this game can offer much more content than even a Â£40/Â£50 game.… ",

As a kid I loved building with Legos, made towns and loved using my imagination to add in stories for things. This is precisely what Minecraft lets you do better than any Lego game out there right now. When you start it can be a little overwhelming, and can seem a bit complicated, but you learn, you master your environment, and you build. In single player it can get a bit lonesome, but if you find a great group of people to play with online there will always be new things to explore, and occasionally surprises (good and bad) left for you to find at your houses. The charming looks, rather amazing landscapes you can find, and the expandability provided by a supportive fan-base will keep you entertained for a while assuming you don\u0027t need to see blood and gore every few minutes to keep your attention. I would like to address some of the ridiculous low scores some users gave the game. Reading through some there appear to be 2 major complaints, one being entirely illegitimate to me. Graphics. This really boils down to an argument the art community had some time ago, something that impressionism annihilated. In order to look good things do not need to strive for photo-realism. If you keep your aesthetic consistent which Minecraft does very well, things will look great even when full of blocks. It all just adds to the core mechanic of the game, you are in a world of building blocks, go build! There is also the trend of those siting graphics for not liking the game actually admit to not trying it purely because of the looks. The second major complaint is that after a while it gets boring. This can be true but is this not true of all games? For me I keep coming back and making new worlds. I do believe you will get your money\u0027s worth of playtime out of the game before becoming bored. All in all I will say this is a game for those with imagination, those who want to see themselves as the last knights of a kingdom long since overrun by undead and explosive creeper hoards, and gathering the last of their resolve strive to survive and rebuild the kingdom that was lost. Or may be you just wanna run a weird hotel in the middle of the ocean with pig riding out back, whatever floats your boat :-p… ",

It\u0027s gotten me through boring calculus lectures and has inspired my Halloween costume. With Minecraft finally being \"released\", it\u0027s interesting when you look back at what it was like when you started. I am going to review this in three different sections: Single Player, Creative Mode, and Multiplayer. Single Player: I started in the early-middle Beta (around Beta 1.3). It was a fun game, building a house to protect yourself from the horrors at night, mining deep down in to the earth to find iron, gold, or, if I was lucky, diamond. I died quite a bit from experimentation (Hint: Don\u0027t dig straight down. That lava is nasty stuff.) but I always kept playing. It\u0027s addicting. Even now, it\u0027s still great. Since I started, they\u0027ve added new mobs (for those that don\u0027t know, mob is short for mobile), new enemies, new blocks, and new concepts. Instead of only caves to explore, there are now strongholds, abandoned mine shafts and more. It\u0027s a blast to play, trying to discover that next cave to explore and mine. The experience system is rather shallow and pointless (enchanting weapons is the only current purpose for those damn green orbs) and I prefer the days of no food bar, where you could simply eat food and your health healed depending on what you ate. I have a few minor gripes with the single player, but they are easily overlooked. SP is, in my opinion, the best part of Minecraft. Creative Mode: Think of this as your canvas to build whatever you want. You have unlimited access to all the blocks and you can build to your heart\u0027s content. A castle, a giant Mario, an underground dungeon...it\u0027s all up to you. This is a fun, albeit rather boring at times, mode. It is good to experiment with, however. Creative mode helped me finally refine all the redstone circuits (complicated electrical stuff) and has helped me tap in to my inner Minecraft engineer. It\u0027s a good mode, but not something that can be played constantly. Multiplayer: Everyone\u0027s experiences with multiplayer depends on what server you play on. I ultimately found it to be kind of boring, no matter if I was on a strict survival server, an RPG server, or just with some of my friends. There is only so much to do in multiplayer and, if you are on a server that is inhabited by many different players, it is likely someone else has already mined that cave you found, or has griefed (destroyed) your house while you were offline. This is the only reason I really gave Minecraft a 9. Overall, Minecraft is a great game that will take your life away. You\u0027ll be obsessed with finding diamonds, caves, or beating that dragon. You\u0027ll find yourself crossing oceans just to find a wolf to follow you around. It\u0027s a great game that everyone should play.… ",

As some of the professional reviews have stated, it is a difficult game to sum up. It is a game that gives you a lot of freedom; you can build whatever you want out of (usually) cube-shaped items, fight a variety of monsters, craft potions and item enchantments, and/or explore a variety of randomly generated biomes, ruins, even villages. Generally speaking, you can choose some of these activities and ignore others, or engage in all of them. The world technically has a limit, but it is so vast (eight times the surface area of Earth) you are extremely unlikely to ever hit the limit. Even if you did, you could simply generate a new world and start anew (without losing anything in your original save). There are currently two game modes: Creative and Survival. Creative gives you all of the materials and lets you freely build, while in Survival you have to worry about maintaining your health and manually collecting items. Regardless of mode, this is a game that is easy to find something to do, whether you only have a few minutes or a few hours. There is both single player and multiplayer available. If you are put off by the default graphics, there are many user-made texture packs available allowing you to choose a look you like. If you are looking for more features, there are also many mods available. Also, as of this writing, Mojang plans to continue releasing bug fixes and new content. It is also pretty friendly to lower-end computers compared to most high-profile games. There are some notable shortcomings. There is no formal in game tutorial; you will probably want to get some help from other people or the Minecraft Wiki when trying Survival mode. Some features are only partially implemented at the moment; notably, the NPC villagers found in the villages cannot be interacted with currently. Multiplayer offers neither an in game server browser or matchmaker, meaning you will have to go through several steps you may not be used to to play with others. Modding isn\u0027t very user friendly either, and this is something that had been promised a long time ago. Mojang claims, however, that they still intend to address this. Even in the current release version (1.0.0), crashes are reasonably frequent for me; thankfully, the game does a good job of saving right before the crash and it is fairly painless to boot up the game again and re-enter the world. Perhaps the biggest criticism I have seen, however, is the absence of any formal goals. Some people have gotten bored of the game pretty quickly. Mojang has addressed this concern somewhat, but to get the most out of the game you will still need to set your own goals. If you think you are at all interested in Minecraft, give Minecraft Classic a try. It is basically an outdated version of Creative mode you can play for free. It will give you some idea of what to expect. If you like it at all, I would encourage you to try the full game. I have enjoyed the game over much of the past year and I expect I will continue to enjoy it for some time to come.… ",

Now onto its multiplayer mechanics it\u0027s multiplayer is well defined and makes a mark for itself just look at the immense servers sprawling with creations requiring tons of people. Lastly Minecraft isn\u0027t a game much more its a genre because now you have games popping up like Terraria, FortressCraft, and alot of other games. So it\u0027s well worth that $26.95 for admission to such a diverse game with endless possiblty and it has so many mods to content people who are getting bored of the vanilla gameplay.… ",

The community of Minecraft is partly why I play the game, it is so creative and helps to keep me interested. So to sum it up, Mojang laid the foundation and the modders built the house. Which is also why I only deem it worthy of a 5. What should they do for me to give them more than 5 ? Make more stuff ! there are so many brilliant promising modders out there who can really contribute to the quality of the game.… ",

But for every seemingly perfect feature,there is a plethora of annoying glitches to accompany it. This is why I have rated it at 7. For the people who are prepared to spend hours on this game, building, mining and exploring, I encourage you to buy it.

As for the graphics, believe it or not, there is appeal in styling it with a retro-pixelated feel. Certainly some people wish every game had a team of 3,000 people working on it and a budget close to a Pirates of the Caribbean movie, like Grand Theft Auto and Call of Duty titles. And I enjoy my fair share of big budget titles, but I\u0027m not dependent on graphics to allow me to enjoy a game, and anyone who is dependent on graphics over gameplay is set up for disappointment not only in this game, but in gaming in general. In this same reasoning, they are a company who has made 1 game, they are still a small developer, AND everyone who is complaining about features bought into the game while in development. I wonder if they\u0027d complain so much if they were trusted to play a beta version of Madden that it wasn\u0027t still fresh after a full year of development. As for complaints about the game being boring, it\u0027s due to the (strangely) realistic nature of the game, in as such that you are alone in the middle of nowhere, and starting with no tools other than your hands. It does take time to assemble a comfortable zone for your player in game, and you are constantly learning through trial-and-error of ways to do things faster and better. The game isn\u0027t boring as much as it\u0027s lonely. And that\u0027s the intention of the developers, and it\u0027s certainly not a flaw or drawback to this game. And for those who need company in their games, the multiplayer option exists. I\u0027ve actually been fortunate enough to have a desktop at home and my own laptop, and my girlfriend used her laptop along with mine to connect to our own server on my desktop, which allowed for a great 2-player game. All in all, the game is great, and the critical reviews explain why. I just wanted to counter the negative user reviews, because sadly, sometimes in every 7 people there is 1 person who can\u0027t be satisfied.… ",

However, if you have a love of creating things and play game that is what you make of it, then minecraft is for you. This is not a traditional game, it is a simplified 3d rendering program done in a game theme. While some may argue your time is better spent actually learning how to use the real programs, minecraft is simpler and cheaper. You literally have the freedom to create whatever your imagination can come up with using 1 meter cubed blocks. The game is simple in appearence, and wonderfully complex at the same time, its simply a matter of how play it. I myself have recreated the Temple of Artemis, a football stadium, an ancient city, Wayne manor....... I\u0027ve seen people do Enterprises, AT-AT walkers, hell go to youtube and search minecraft, you\u0027ll see a near endless list of things people have done. And then there is the modding community that creates some wonderful modes that enhance the gameplay, like the planes mod for example. And while the game is really fun solo, it is even more amazing when playing with a group of friends, the stuff my friends and I have created is amazing and alot of fun to do. Remember the game is what you make of it, so have fun.… ",

Minecraft seems to suffer from an identity crisis these days. \"Am I a sandbox game?\" or \"Am I an adventure narrative?\", this is the major question here. While minecraft did well as a no goal, build what you want with survival aspects sandbox title, the addition of a tacked on endgame event complete with halfhearted ending text \"reveal\" left me wanting. While many \"features\" have been added since the 1.7 beta release, one must ask \"how well have said additions meshed or added to the gameplay?\". In my experience, the answer is not that well. What was once a fun open ended building block set has devolved into a confused rpg title with no defined narrative or point, and that\u0027s without addressing the glaring instability, bugs and varying performance issues apparent from version to version. All I can say is that minecraft started with much promise, and has proceded to fail to live up to any of the potential it promised throughout development.… ",

The game, if you can even call it that, hasn\u0027t really developed into anything lasting even though its been in development for almost 2 years with more feedback prior to official release than probably any other game. It doesn\u0027t take very long with the game to encounter any one of its numerous faults: buggy features (even with a revisit, the mine carts have numerous problems), incomplete features (achievements are basically filler and the nether was a waste of development time), a complete lack of multiplayer server browsing, stupid AI, and to top it all off the game is essentially over within a few hours - you can obtain all of the items and see all of the sites and enemies in one sitting. This all assumes that your computer will even run the game as many systems encounter memory leaks that guarantee crashing with just a few minutes of play. It upsets me that the critics completely overlooked these many short comings as though the game is perfect. The worst part is that many of these problems have existed for months and there is still no indication that they\u0027ll be fixed anytime soon. Without providing the proper feedback, Minecraft may never actually get the serious attention it requires to earn the grade it has received. There is just so much potential in a voxel engine and Minecraft hasn\u0027t even begun to tap it.

Like other games to come before it, the mod community absolutely makes this game, and Notch is in complete denial about this fact. The game is still missing fundamental features and sorely needed code optimization, but instead Mojang insists on adding cake and dragons. This game is in no way complete, finished, or polished and as such it is rather sad to see the metacritic score eclipsing the mirror-finish polished Skyrim.

That\u0027s the fascinating thing about this game, is that it is made to be a single player survival game, but unintentionally has practically turned into an MMO with all of the online modding capabilities. Idk if it\u0027s fair or not, but i docked a point for the speed of Majang\u0027s work, I\u0027ve been in beta for 11 months and haven\u0027t seen much added. Sure there\u0027s a big list of core changes to the game in the last year, but month-to-month it\u0027s actually not that much. Keep in mind that I am rating this as an indie game, as if this were a fully financed corporate project then I would rate this a 6, due to lack of content, but for a small team of developers, the fair price (comparative to a typical game), and the online community, this is definitely deserving of at least a 9.… ",

Then Minecrafts popularity shot up. All my friends bought it and I created a multiplayer server. After about two weeks of building a huge town with my friends I grew bored once again. By this time Minecraft was huge, Notch was rich, and everyone was playing this game. Notch created his own company and started hiring people. This is where it goes downhill. Mojang became very lazy and started releasing updates every blue moon. These updates generally did not add that much, and most of the major content they released through updates were already stuff done a lot better by modders. They rarely fixed major bugs that have been in the game for a while and every update added more bugs. They fixed some but still some major bugs have not been addressed. Still Minecraft has gained massive amounts of popularity through all this. So Mojang is sitting around raking the money in, and people are still playing. This doesn\u0027t mean Minecraft is a bad game, it is just that there is hardly enough content to make it a real game. It has potential to be very fun. If it had better MP, where AI was actually difficult, combat was actually fun, and building bases was mean\u0027t for survival I would still be playing this game. But Mojang is just selling us a simple block builder game, and I don\u0027t see them adding any major content that will make the game fun for me for a while. One day it may be there, but for now it is just a dull block building game. And the people who whine about the graphics are idiots.

Unlike Marmite however, it lasts you far longer than just trying it once and then never coming back to it. The basic premise behind Minecraft is that you do whatever you want to do, within the limits of the game, of which there are basically none. This makes it one of the most addicting single player games i have ever played. You can attempt to survive in the hostile world, craft all manner of items and even just build a massive pink woolly castle just because you feel like it. Minecraft has two modes; Creative and Survival. Creative is the mode where you are given unlimited amounts of every block which you may do with what you please, Survival challenges you to gather the resources yourself in an attempt to survive the monsters that come out at night in the Minecraft world. To survive in this world, you may craft anything from swords to minecarts, jukeboxes to bread and this is where the main issue with Minecraft comes in. it is hard to become fully immersed in a game where you have to consistently tab out to check the internet for recipes on crafting, which with no guide available in game, is often. A further issue is with the recent implication of potions and enchantments. These seem very tacky and seem to work inconsistently and are relatively pointless. The way that Minecraft worked until full release was that it would receive regular free updates adding new features, often as suggested by players. I fear that now following the release of the full game, these updates will become \"expansion packs\" which can only be obtained through payment. Many of these updates in the past have not been worth paying for, and so if this situation develops, it will most likely detract away from the game. A further issue is the ending of the game, which seems very unplanned and the difficulty level of the game sparks highly at this point. However, ignoring these factors to the game, there are many good things about this game. One is the style of graphics in the game, which means that most computers will not struggle to apply textures and allows for much customization of the game. This is seen through the huge amount of mods and texture packs that are available for the game. However another issue with this is at there is no in game method of implementing mods, and players must have some technical knowledge to get them to work. It must of course be mentioned that there is a multiplayer option to this game through the ability to join friends servers ( a program for which can be downloaded from Minecraft\u0027s website) and craft, mine and build with friends. However, the only way to join a server is to directly enter the ip address and even though the game saves that server from thereon, it is still annoying that you cannot see a list of available servers for you to join. Some aspects of the single player game do not work in multiplayer which is extremely annoying for those who want to explore Minecraft\u0027s full potential with friends. To conclude Minecraft is a great game with quaint graphics and addicting gameplay however the many faults it still has makes me think that is possibly should have remained in beta for a while longer to work out the kinks and adjust some of the features within the game. Taking all my points made into account I award this game 7 out of 10 with hopes that perhaps in a view months this review will no longer be relevant due to updates since.… ",

The fate of character is fully up to you. With so many things to do it seems like it would take an endless amount of time to completely explore the world of Minecraft. However, the game felt slightly repetitive too. I found myself going on to online servers for a more interactive approach. The online is really enjoyable also but it too is not perfect. There are risks to playing online: \"grieving\" which can be annoying. Also I have had a server crash on me a few times. Both single player and online Minecraft are fun enough to keep you playing for hours, if not days or months. The game design is fun with a 8-bit look. It is easy to learn while playing and controlling it isn\u0027t hard. Overall, the game doesn\u0027t deserve and perfect score but I would DEFINITELY recommend it to anyone looking for a new game.… ",

However, what we have here is the birth of a new game genre which inspired other game developers to create similar games (the most famous is Terraria). Despite the blocky and pixelated graphics (or better saying: Voxels) Minecraft is another proof you don\u0027t need a PS3 or DX11 graphics to make a game good and entertaining. Sure, sometimes you get lost and bored when you don\u0027t know what to do, but as long you have a goal to do in this game it\u0027ll never get boring. Be building (or reforming) a home, crafting new items, spelunking the caves searching for rare minerals, wandering in the vast world or just creating or recreating a mansion or whatever you want to do in the Creative Mode. Also despite the blocky graphics, Minecraft CAN scare you. Specially when you\u0027re venturing in the mines. Nothing more scaring than digging for minerals in a mine when suddenly you hear a \"sssss\" right behind you before you\u0027re victim of a explosion (and dies) or when you turn around a dark corner just to see a big and furry spider lunging at your face. In the end, Minecraft is a game for creative and intelligent gamers who can see what lies behind a world made of blocked and \"ugly\" grafics. In my most honest opinion, if this game don\u0027t deserves a 10. Then no other game deserves it.… ",

Personally, i believe this game is just filled with people with outdated computers trying to have fun with their friends with equally outdated computers. Somehow this ended up with them convinced that this was a good game and so a cult following was born. I decided to give this a better rating than zero only because some people may enjoy learning all the different combinations of crafting within this game.

If I were reviewing the alpha or the beta, it would be closer to a 8 or a 9 out of 10. But this is a \"complete\" game we\u0027re talking about, selling for a retail price. And unfortunately, it is not quite worth that price. Minecraft is a sandbox/adventure game, heavy on the sandbox, with retro-style graphics that grow on the player after a short while. The sandbox -- eventually a block-building game, with a limited number of contraptions and mechanics that can be constructed -- will provide hours of fun. The adventure aspect is half-baked and incomplete, and, as of right now, more or less pointless. Alpha and beta had much promise, the former being of truly excellent value (guaranteeing access to all future updates). I can\u0027t even begin to count how many hours I spent playing the alpha and beta versions of this game. A truly fun, creative, excellent experience. There is no doubt that Minecraft has in some ways revolutionized gaming, and there is no doubt that many people will derive hours upon hours of enjoyment from it. But it should not have been released as it is right now. The developers have referred to this release as a \"milestone\" rather than an actual point of completion; but, if that\u0027s the case, then they should not have released it as a retail game, effectively doubling the price. Some problems include: many in-game items that have no use or that are redundant; virtually non-existent AI (definitely no pathfinding); loads of bugs; overly-wrought world generation code that has gone from producing fantastical, vibrant worlds to dull, unimaginative ones; various in-game objects that are mere \"placeholders\" and have no real point, as of yet; a botched \"end-game\" experience hastily added weeks before release; a limited number of materials (coal, iron, gold, diamond, and redstone are still the only truly functional ores that can be mined); and a lot of unfulfilled plans and broken promises. When alpha was around $10, buying the game was no-brainer; I have logged so many hours that it\u0027s absolutely worth it. The \"full\" version for $30? I\u0027m not so sure. Do not buy unless you are absolutely certain that this kind of game is for you (and it may very well be).… ",

Even if you get bored of the vanilla game, there is a enormous modding community that will satisfy all your wants. Survival and creation are the two main aspects of minecraft. In survival mode you gather resources and shelter your self from the evil of the night, monsters such as creepers, skeletons and zombies will ambush you throughout the game and you will need weaponry, defence and protection to fight back the threat. With enough resources, you can make anything you can imagine, following a isometric system that doesn\u0027t fail to dissapoint. Creative mode is more of an extra feature, allowing you to build whatever you can think of. it doesn\u0027t give the ammount of satisfaction that survival gives, but is a great passtime and great for displaying creations to your friends and the community. Dimensions in both modes add more depth to the game. The nether is a hellish hostile world with special resources necessary for projects such as glowstone, blaze rods and netherrack. The end ( also known as the Ender) is... well let me not ruin that for you ;) Multiplayer is even better. it takes a while to get it running, and with bad connection servers can be quite laggy but playing with a friend is a new experience on itself. The only issue i really have with minecraft is that i feel as if notch is making it feel a bit too constrained. In alpha and early beta, nothing really mattered and you just were there, but now it makes me feel as if i\u0027m forced to follow a set amount of goals every time i start up a new world. Still, minecraft doesn\u0027t fail to dissapoint me and millions of others. Minecraft is more than just a game. Its an experience and nothing is more satisfying than setting yourself a goal and achieving it. I give minecraft a 9 for +1 style +1 great concept +1 endless +1 SMP +1 unlimited creativity +1 Great community +1 a lot of items and collectivity +1 ton\u0027s of replayability +1 Great bang for your buck +1 Redstone - 1 for feeling a bit forced to do things now.… ",

There is an infinitely generating map stretching as far as you care to wonder, and the abundance of modifications that allow you to reinvent the game a million times over, keep it mostly \"new\". Now thats the game in a nutshell, however there are a few aspects, both the technical and audible that leave you with a bitter taste after a few hours of gameplay. The sounds clips of doors opening and closing, the sound of zombies, cows and chickens can get annoying. Especially after 9345th time a door creaks open with the exact same repetitive sound clip it always used. Also it only takes about an hour to become effectively invincible to any attack, which needless to say eliminates the challenging aspect of the game almost entirely. Now thats off-putting, I know. However, like I mentioned in the first paragraph, the modifications expand the possibilities of, well anything, thats whats so good about the Minecraft mods. The modifications allowed me to fly in a zeppelin and listen to voice acting and read scriptures as I progressed through a user made story line! People say the graphics aren\u0027t very good. At your first glance you\u0027d be forgiven to think so. Yes the textures are repetitive, but you have to expect that. They are definitely memorable though, you won\u0027t find anything like minecraft textures anywhere else! However the game does infact upscale the resolution depending on the size of the window. And the lighting is surprisingly beautiful. Yes the shadows are completely static and blurry, but the sun setting and rising is genuinely beautiful! So maybe think twice when your calling the graphics bad. There really isn much more to say about this game. The modifications make this game interesting, nothing else. If you don\u0027t intend on modding this game, I suggest you don\u0027t intend on buying this game.… ",

I respect mojang and people really seem to forget they are indie developers, I\u0027m grateful notch keeps up with the community which most developers don\u0027t do. And one of the greatest things about this game is that there really is no goal, yeah now there is the end, but still use your imagination. I love the graphics of this game, funny how people call it 70s like graphics i wouldn\u0027t like the game if it had a more real approach to it.

However, as of the 1.8 Adventure Update, I\u0027ve felt the game has been somewhat ruined by the new, rpg style elements they\u0027ve tried to implement. The Endermen seem forced, and don\u0027t seem to click in with the game\u0027s atmosphere, or the previous four mobs, at least in my opinion, and the same with the new Silverfish. I thought the hunger bar was clumsy and unnecessary, as is the levelling and enchanting system. For me this has let the game down and left it in a bit of a mess, unsure of what kind of game it wants to be. Also, many people (including myself) have found the novelty to wear off not long after purchase, so be warned, and try and play with friends on a server if you can, and remember what you see is exactly what you get with this game.… ",

Yet despite this, the fact that I am still able to award it a score of 6/10 is testament to the fundamental fun factor of the voxel-based gameplay. Minecraft has predominantly two main gameplay styles: lego sandbox creativity and first person survival. Both of these elements complement each other nicely. Want to build a log cabin? Then first you must go out to gather wood, battling any monsters you might encounter along the way. Want to increase your chances of survival? Then you might want to dig out an underground fortress with easy access to ores and resources. Both aspects have an almost symbiotic relationship. This raw Minecraft gameplay is great, allowing you to build whatever your heart\u0027s desire, and thankfully hasn\u0027t really changed much since the game was in the alpha stage. However, there has been a gradual shoehorning in of a third gameplay style -- the RPG -- and with it has come a lot of the bugs and rushed features now plaguing the game. Firstly, let\u0027s get one of the main problems out of the way -- NPC villages. These are, to put it bluntly, terrible. The village buildings are passable, but the villagers themselves have absolutely awful character models, almost zero AI, they don\u0027t speak, they don\u0027t react in any way (even if you attack them), and don\u0027t seem to serve any purpose whatsoever. Secondly -- experience orbs. These are glowing orbs that drop after you kill a monster which can be used as a kind of enchantment currency. A very strange and seemingly rushed experience system. Rather than have a dedicated skill tree which might be spent on extra mining speed or other useful attributes, the points are used to apply a completely random enchantment on an item. Because of this randomness, the system adds a horrific level of slot-machine grinding as you waste a lot of time struggling to get a half decent enchantment. ** Spoilers in this paragraph ** Thirdly -- the End. This new other worldly dimension was added to give the game a final level and a proper ending. In theory it is not too bad an idea, but the implementation is poor. The End is really just a very dark and uninteresting boss arena populated by Endermen monsters, a few pillars, and a dragon boss. The dragon boss has minimal AI, no phases, doesn\u0027t breath fire, but does have a gargantuan energy bar which makes for a very tedious end boss fight. After successfully defeating the dragon you then get an incredibly long-winded pseudo-philosophical text narrative that seems to come out of nowhere, which is at its best hollow and at its worst cringe-worthy. You are also rewarded with a dragon egg that can\u0027t be picked up, but which teleports a few squares away from you when you hit it... ? **End of spoilers ** I\u0027ll leave the criticisms of the new RPG mechanics there, but the overriding feeling you get is that it would have been better if instead of working on adding these rather slap-dash features, the developers should have been refining and polishing the existing gameplay. There are still a lot of things that could have been addressed before the final release. Stuff like: no water life, no wool regrowth, oppressive void fog, ugly swamp transitions, no mod API, no path-finding AI, game-breaking terrain generation bugs etc. To sum up, if the game was still in the alpha stage with the cheaper price tag, you could easily overlook the current bugs and missing features, but as a final release it is severely lacking the necessary polish required to give it a rating it could potentially deserve.… ",

Such as melons being easier to farm but wheat can be used to get your more animals (etc) or stone pick axes are better at mining huge areas than iron pick axes but iron picks pick faster, etc. The people who are voting this game down dont like sandbox games and cant see beyond their own gameplay perspectives, Geoffory2 says \"this game is repetitive and boring\" well its an opinion. You cant state opinion without evidence. Dont forget that this game is very unique in comparison to other titles, seriously, give this game a shot because its a master piece. (but only if you like sandbox games) if you dont like sandbox games then dont buy it, its as simple as that. Some people are marking this game down for the modding community working faster than Notch (the game creator) WHATS THE PROBLEM WITH MODS? MORE CONTENT FOR YOU.Some say \"OMG THE GRAPHICS SUCK, THIS GAME IS SO GAY\" well guess what, those people are COD aid infected idiots, because minecraft was not meant to be a very graphical game, graphics are extra credit really, nothing more. Also, it does NOT perform terribly if you simply dont set everything on highest settings, yes folks the rules still apply because JAVA is a REALLY REALLY BAD ENGINE. If there are any problems with this game, its that notch worked so slowly to get everything right before it was released, but that does not matter now!… ",

The game is also riddled with bugs that seemingly take years for the creator to fix and the ending is pathetic.

But after you get into the swing of things, the game\u0027s presentation woes gets entirely forgotten. It then becomes a good thing. I was absolutely obsessed with this game for a couple months.The graphics are outdated, but really memorable like that. After you achieve tons in the game like I did, the non-linearity starts to become a bad thing again. While the game is infinite, there is a point where you feel like \"What do I do now?\" While you could just build, unless your some type of artist who loves to create things, you won\u0027t really feel like you are moving forward in the game. After that, I turned to the multiplayer portion of the game. Setting up servers is really annoying, and you\u0027ll likely take a few tries (unless your a computer whiz) to really understand what you\u0027re doing. The game is twice as fun playing with friends however - it adds interaction to a once solo and barren experience and it made it feel.. more worthwhile. Eventually that will get old to, though. Summary: Overall this game has creative, super non-linear gameplay, iconic outdated graphics, tons and tons and tons of lasting appeal.… ",

It\u0027s my belief the devs are happily sitting on their hands laughing as they swim in the money that people are pouring into this under-developed and under-supported game that has somehow become so popular without actually offering much of anything. Add some legitimate content, devs, and I\u0027ll be the happiest man alive. Until then: Skyrim modding and Terraria 1.1!… ",

When I started hearing about a game where you could build anything, from a small cabin to a gigantic castle in hell, I immediately wanted it.You have to admit, Minecraft is not just a game any more; it is also a genre. Sandbox games have risen in popularity due to their open-ended nature. I have played at least 100 hours on Minecraft over 10 months. I love sandbox gameplay in general: build what you want, do what you want, it is your world to make. Minecraft revolutionized the genre and caused a host of games inspired by or copies of it due to its simple, yet addictive gameplay. I personally want to say I like building, but I always end up killing all enemies within 1000 blocks of my house. My only problem with Minecraft is that its combat system is too simple. While simplicity is one of the major positives of the game, I found combat lacking. Make a sword and that\u0027s it; easy enemies to fight. This is why I prefer Terraria, another great sandbox game people have mistaken;y called 2-d Minecraft. This one problem aside, Minecraft has to be one of my favorite games of all time, providing endless hours of gameplay (quite literally), nostalgic graphic style and the ability to craft your own world. Minecraft has taken the world by surprise, selling millions of copies with absolutely no real advertising. If you are on the fence on whether to buy this game, buy it. It is worth every penny.… ",

I have played minecraft since the first release of alpha, and have loved it all the way. The graphics that some people call s*** make the spirit of the game, and actually make it better. Without these graphics, Minecraft would not have its charm and would not be Minecraft. The building side of MInecraft is amazing, being able to construct everything you dream of. Survival mode pits you against monsters that come out at night, and all in all is REALLY FUN. The developers are not lazy, as many have said. They work there butts of every day to make new content and add what fans want, constantly making the game more fun and exciting. Multiplayer is extremely fun, espacially with bukkit and plugins adding factions, npcs, and other great things to MInecraft. The reason why this game is so popular is that you can do anything you want, as the Yogscast have shown us, even make a gigantic sprawling story with twists and turns! Graphics - 10/10 (Without them Minecraft would not be Minecraft, and it would not be good) Gameplay - 10/10 (Very fun and keeps yoy coming back and thinking about it throughout your day) Story - 10/10 (You make your own story, and can do anything you want on your own or with friends) Extra: Singleplayer - 9/10 (Very very good, but can get boring after 250 hours of play) Multiplayer 10+/10 (Best multiplayer experience I have ever player, and I have played A LOT!)… ",

While I\u0027m sad to see it suffer in that regard, I\u0027m very glad that for every nay-sayer there are 5 people who could blow me away with their creations and excellent uses of the ultimate sandbox world. However, I think there is one big flaw in Minecraft, and that is the development team. I do realize it is an indie developer, and can only handle so many bug fixes and content addition, many of them (Notch especially) were planning and talking about moving on from Minecraft to new projects before the game was even released at Minecon. There was so much potential and momentum in this game that I thought was lost in the area of the staffing at Mojang. However, the silver lining is that much of that potential was regained within the excellent modding community. All that aside, Minecraft is a game one would enjoy in a predisposed \"creative\" mood. Typically I find those who don\u0027t enjoy it aren\u0027t visual thinkers, and enjoy tight corridor games with point and shoot mechanics. But at the end of the day, Minecraft is, by indie development standards, an excellent and solid game. Bugs are minor and exploitable, and otherwise go unnoticed at times. Content may be lacking in some respect, but it has come a long way from the alpha version.… ",

My biggest complaint, however, is that the servers that don\u0027t lag require you to donate, which leaves the rest of us to aimlessly wander around the Spawn building, hoping that someone will start an interesting conversation. You don\u0027t even want to go and explore because the world has been devoid of its beauty and turned into a flatland full of eyesores.

Minecraft has such great potential in so many ways, it\u0027s possible to make MMORPG-like servers, competetitive pvp servers, and everything in between. The problem is, that mojang has decided to spend most of their time on other projects, and adding new features to minecraft. Why is this bad? Because they\u0027ve released a non-working incredibly glitchy game, and yet they\u0027ve decided to spend time on either making completely unrelated games, or making it more glitchy by adding more features. Anybody who wants mojang to add more features is downright stupid, mojang will never be able to satisfy every persons need, it\u0027s an impossible task. The fact that so many kids want them to take on the task (and more incredibly that they have taken on the task) is just unbelievable considering the owner is supposedly a member of mensa. Mojang have supplied us with the base, let the modders take over from here. The only feature they need to add now is some sort of clientside mod API, like spoutcraft but without the need for each player to install it. After this, fix bugs, make the game run as smooth as possible, but do not add anymore features. FIXING BUGS \u003e ADDING USELESS FEATURES… ",

The main idea is building anything you want out of the blocks that create the massive random generated world you are on. The biggest flaw of this concept is building anything you want is limited by just how creative you are. A natural artist could spend months building complicated designs, but for most people, they will only build simple things. The problem is the eventual lack of direction for most people. Survival mode starts the player in the middle of nowhere, having to rush building a shelter for the night before zombies come and eat you. It sound exciting and it is exciting on the first night, but once you figure out how to build a proper shelter, enemies become irrelevant. The player then may decide to dig to as far down as they go, and find the rare diamond. Yet again this is exciting the first time you do it, but becomes completely boring any other time. Exploring also may be fun at first, but becomes pointless shortly after. Currently minecraft is $26.95, which is an absurd price for the game. Most people will struggle to finding things to do after 5 to 10 hours of gameplay. Even if you are the creative type that spends countless hours painting or just building, that hefty of a price tag is not worth it. Unless the game price is lowered or on sale to something more reasonable like $10 would I buy this game. Don\u0027t waste your time otherwise.… ",

Put it this way, the game was worth it in BETA, not so much in it\u0027s current state. The Full Retail seems rushed and not complete. BETA - The Beta was fun, building large complex structures is great, especially in Multiplayer. Singleplayer gets old real fast, unless you\u0027re into building stuff out of the world stuff like a 1 to 1 scale of Middle Earth and have no life. Full Retail - Like I mentioned, feels very rushed and incomplete. While the Beta was fun and full of anticipation, the Full Retail adds little while adding what seems to be \u0027a lot\u0027 on the surface. In other words, inconsistent. Here\u0027s hoping that Notch will continue supporting the game, because the Retail version isn\u0027t the minecraft I enjoyed in Beta.… ",

Minecraft is a sandbox game. There are no scripted objectives, no \"go there and get me this and that\". There are many RPG elements such as armour, enchanting, and potions, as well as the old hotbar. There\u0027s also the survival element (if you choose to play survival mode). But minecraft is more about doing it your way. You can choose any playstyle, not constrained by pesky quests or classes or objectives. There are no restrictions. You can feel free to do whatever you want. Want to make a giant LolCat picture? Sure, go ahead. Even open world games like Skyrim can\u0027t give you this amount of freedom. It\u0027s even better when playing with friends, building giant structures together. If building isn\u0027t your thing, you can go exploring for dungeons or monster hunting. And of course, the modding and mapping community is basically what makes Minecraft one of the greatest games of all time. There are countless mods for almost anything you can think of. From advanced machines to cool magic and wizadry mods, mods make Minecraft have a limitless amount of replayability. Not the mention the plethora of custom maps and adventures that are like playing an RPG.… ",

The game has (as far as I\u0027m concerned) infinite replay-ability, due to the very nature of the game. And I\u0027ve seen people complaining that \u0027it has no story\u0027. That\u0027s the whole point, everything is left for the player to imagine, including the origins of the world you just created if you so wish. This is not COD, this is not an action filled, heavily scripted, game where you can almost guess that somethings about to explode in your face. This is, along with a few other games, nearly completely unscripted. As for the ending, it is there not to explain the world you made and how it came to be, but to thank the modding community for all the support they have shown for the game. However, i have to say that the final release was almost rushed out, simply because people were growing impatient and wanted it right here, right now. The fact that some people would complain that Notch is ignoring the bugs is ridiculous, he originally wanted to completely iron out all the bugs, but the fanbase said he could do that over the next few updates. And Minecraft is still updating, it can only get, while there are a few things left to be desired, better.… ",

The end dimension is very pointless and you can tell that there wasn\u0027t much effort put into coming up with it, as with most of their other updates...just read the update history and you\u0027ll see: Mooshroom cows for example. Don\u0027t buy this and get Terraria instead. You can usually get it for under $3 on Steam (it goes on sale all the time) and it\u0027s a much better made (and less buggy) game.… ",

It\u0027s good, but it\u0027s just not for me and whether or not you\u0027re going to like a game like this depends solely on how much of a \u0027builder\u0027 you have in you. Some people just have a proclivity for making things, playing with legos, building stuff in a shed, tinkering with their car, etc, and if you\u0027re one of those people then this game is like catnip for you. But if you\u0027re a person that likes to sample things but not get too involved, or play competitive style games, or be \u0027the best\u0027 at something, then take a pass. Minecraft is, essentially, a simplified map editor that you get in other games like Starcraft or Civilization. If you played a game like Starcraft or Warcraft and used to pore over the editor making the perfect map, then this game is probably for you, but if you spent all your time online on ladder then it\u0027s probably not. It\u0027s a good game for what it is, but it\u0027s definitely a niche game and not for everybody.… ",

The game isn\u0027t an AAA game, and if you can\u0027t rap your head around the fact it doesn\u0027t have good graphics, and you can\u0027t play it because of that, then so be it. You get used to the games graphics, and then eventually love it, and its uniqueness. This game is hands-down amazing. I started playing when it was Alpha, and it didn\u0027t even have multiplayer at the time. Back then, it was so much fun to play Single Player, because you had an entire world to explore and make a house impervious to enemies, find out all the tricks to the game and the like. I have played many games, and I must say, this game compels you strongly to build bigger houses, get better gear, find better ways of producing your resources, and the like. Then Multiplayer came out-- the game became wonderful! Sure, it had a few kinks here and there, but having friends to explore that world with, makes you feel like you were a little kid again exploring the world as a free soul trying to find cool things to do. The only problem was, after Multiplayer came out, Single Player was not worth playing to me anymore, because my friends couldn\u0027t use the things I made, therefore Single Player felt worthless.But, the game is wonderful: music that fits the atmosphere, gripping gameplay that makes you thirst for more, and graphics that gives it, its own style and spot inside your heart. As a side note, forget all those people that keep complaining about Notch and his choices; everyone makes mistakes and he has made a few, but he has still tried to make the game great, even more so great than it already is.… ",

Early in the development cycle they were adding a whole lot of really interesting things (secret Friday updates were always a joy). Right around 1.6, 1.7 though, the quality of development dropped with an almost audible \u0027clunk\u0027. Instead of new, interesting things, we get... wolves. Well okay, fine - they can just fix bugs for a while and maybe do performance optimization, maybe - but they didn\u0027t even really do that. For a while, the updates were adding as many bugs as they were fixing. My heart sank when I realized that they were going to add a level system... because I knew they would not do it justice. And that\u0027s exactly what happened. Some odd months later, we get the \"retail\" version of minecraft. At the last second (really, the last month of its development to this period was a *massive* crunch), they started shoving in a bunch of features that users didn\u0027t really want or even cared for. None of these really expanded game time at all - people who had already caught the carrot at the end of the stick would feel cheated. We got animal breeding, NPC villages... which are really just mobs that don\u0027t do anything, and more randomly generated structures, all-in-all. The biomes were improved, we got some changes to seed generation and other such minor fixes that didn\u0027t really impact gameplay - but made it a whole lot more sellable. The final straw? Dragons. They were so pathetic and desperate for sales, they literally slapped in a dragon to a spot where they simply ran out of ideas. Considering Skyrim came out around the same time... yeah. Sigh. Even worse, the devs had hinted at more interesting game modes, which simply never materialized. But you\u0027ll note I gave it a 7, still. This is because the game, at is very core elements, deserve that. If you haven\u0027t played it before, the easy comparison is electronic legos with a greater sense of reward. The \"game\" elements to it, survival mode, really only exist to make the creative part of it more rewarding. Monsters are not difficult to fight and absurdly predictable, AI pathfinding is so laughably bad it\u0027ll routinely fall down into lava or kill itself, health regenerates pretty quickly, and nothing really hurts you with armor. In fact, mid-to-late game, the only thing that can really kill you is lava, and that\u0027s if you\u0027re really being dumb about mining in the first place. It\u0027s not really \u0027surviving\u0027 it\u0027s \"building\" which is occasionally interrupted by the need to gather materials, kill some monsters, and eat food. You don\u0027t need to build walls to protect yourself - the most safe thing to do is just dig a hole in the ground. Really. That all being said, the game is wonderfully fun for the first week or so if you have any desire to build things. If you have a goal you want to materialize, Minecraft is addictive, simple, and fun. Multiplayer is great in every sense except for PvP which is *almost* pointless. But the true potential in the game is actually the fact that it\u0027s in Java, there\u0027s an absurdly large modding community, and the devs screwed up so hard at the end. Mods have literally increased the amount of time I\u0027ve played this game by a factor of five, if not more. If you like building, there\u0027s Buildcraft. If you like crazy fun things, there\u0027s Equivalent Exchange. If you like end game things, there\u0027s Industrialcraft 2. If you like circuits, there\u0027s Redpower 2. Simple mods are so trivial and easy to make it doesn\u0027t even require a working knowledge of Java. The tutorials will guide you literally through every step. If you\u0027re looking for a canvas to mod and add your own ideas to, while learning a language, this is clearly the game for you. It\u0027s a seven because while great, they stopped making it good halfway through and just started adding in things that would help it sell. I got it for half off the beta price and it was well worth my money, but if I had paid four times as much I might feel a little peeved. It\u0027s a creativity tool first and foremost, and while Mojang is a business, they missed a huge opportunity for the sake of cashing in as much money from this cow as possible. I would not advise you to get this on anything but the PC because mods are just that amazing.… ",

Most games give you the content. Minecraft gives you the tools. So people who wants to be served content shouldn\u0027t play this game. People who can give them their own content should play it. I\u0027m gonna give Minecraft 9 in score, because I know how to play it.… ",

Creative mode is just bad, it\u0027s just like legitimate mods, and how is that fun? Then they added crap to the nether, and etc. Minecraft is just like any other video game now. It\u0027s amazing how it turned to one of the year\u0027s best into the biggest trainwrecks this year. Is Minecraft still a good game? Yes, yes it is. Do I still play it? If I\u0027m bored, yes. Do I recommend this game? Yes, but 1.8+ ruined some of the best elements of the game. In 1.9, they added Villagers, them alone ruins the clever feeling of YOU being the last person on earth. Which is how I felt before they came out. 1.0.0 had a bug, where servers are down, saying there is an invalid server key. Thirst was \"added\" but there is no bar, it just helps prevent your hunger from going down. I forgot to mention expirence, which makes this sandbox game into a RPG. These updated also, take the fun out of Mineraft, they are taking a blocky \"creep controled\" land, too seriously. However, what was Minecraft is still there, and you will still enjoy this game and probably always will. Minecraft will always be itself in a unique way, and it is worth the cheap 20 dollar price tag. Mojang and Markus Persson have overall, done proud with Minecraft and they still continue to update it. However, I still look forward to see what they have planned for us in the future as they are very intelligent and I\u0027m sure they will release a few witty updates. Although its no longer a sandbox game, Minecraft is still enoyable, and that is what videogames are all about.… ",

Pay little attention to any reviewDon\u0027t be fooled by the media attention and hype surrounding Minecraft : It is an incomplete mess of a product - I\u0027m not even calling it a game, it\u0027s only intention from day one was to line Notch\u0027s grubby pockets with more gold. The game is supposed to have a \"retro\" feel to it, it was meant to be a \"fresh\" new indie game which \"innovated\" the genre. Pay little attention to any review which uses any of these buzzwords. For anyone that played any games which could be defined as retro, you would understand that these games made best use of the graphics they had available to them at the time. Some of them could even be described as visual masterpieces. Minecraft feels like somebody who has never played a retro game in their life before and with little knowledge of the genre has rushed together an abortion of a better game. Every single video game is supposed to have a point, a purpose or a goal for the character or players to achieve. It could be as simple as \"deactivating a bomb\" or far more complex like the complete storylines found in many modern RPGs. What is the point of Minecraft? What is the player striving to achieve? Nothing. There is no point to anything in this game. Why are villages randomly spawned in the deserts? Can you even interact with the NPCs you find? You can\u0027t. There is no purpose to them whatsoever - If you attack them.. they do nothing... you cannot trade with them, they own no items and wander around aimlessly. If this game was still in a beta stage I could appreciate that this is work in progress. But it isn\u0027t... This is what the game developers actually want you to play.. this is the display of their talents for the world to see. The only pro of this game is the music, which although it is only a single track it is very soothing to dig away to in the middle of the night. Playing this game online with friends was supposed to be the clincher, but that really gets boring after a while, especially once you realise how poorly made the combat system is for this game. Even if every other aspect of this game was the same, if the developers had even bothered to introduce a decent combat system then I could appreciate this game for what it is, and even give it a better score. However the fact that the developers had left such a poor combat system - which was supposed to be one of the primary features of this game - seems to round this game off as a rushed product with no real intention of being decent. I recall retro games from the 1990s with hundreds of different combat features that wound the audience into the web of the games story. But minecraft only has ONE single click attack... that is it. You must beat your opponents to death with an array of different weapons (4 or 5 different coloured swords) and that really is it. Once you have a full set of Diamond armour pretty much any attacks made by NPCs against your character is made redundant and that makes the game far too easy - where is the replay value in that? Diamond armour can also be made only an hour or two into a game so there isn\u0027t even a challenging aspect for combat in this game.… ",

There\u0027s been a few times where I\u0027ve gotten completely bored with it, but then I just wait about a month and I\u0027m hooked again. The replay value is amazing, the lack of story line is excused because of the style of the game and surprisingly enough, the graphics are amazing. Before you jump to conclusions, I do realize that the graphics are all \"blocky and square\". But that\u0027s what makes it so amazing, it recreates the pixel feeling from old video games, looks great, and accept it or not, it\u0027s a big part of the game it self. It wouldn\u0027t really be Minecraft without the \"blockness\", would it?… ",

While at first glance, graphics seem poor and gameplay stagnant, they say you are only limited by your imagination. While not entirely true, it does accomplish many things that may make it seem that way. First, the world is infinitely large for the most part and is \"randomly\" generated based on the seed for the world. This may very well the best thing about the game. The lack of boundaries and varied terrain give it a feel no other game has. Next, it has random caves, the nether, the end, the enderdragon, creatures (both good and evil), npc villages, a wire system, crafting, enchanting, etc. Many of these things serve their own purpose, but a few are noticeably a WIP, which I can NOT respect in a game that has been \"released\". Call me old fashioned, but I like games to be COMPLETED on release as it should be the final product. The first major drawback to me are the villagers. These human-like npcs are unresponsive and simply walk around, even if attacked. They serve NO purpose other than decoration for the villages. Next, the Nether is basically worthless. Go once and hope to find once of those premade dungeons to get the items you need. Leave and hope you never have to go back to that bland atmosphere. Finally, I really began to dislike the newest additions such as the Enderdragon, Enchanting, Villages, Strongholds, Ruins, Mineshafts, or basically anything premade in the world generator. It doesn\u0027t feel like the original Minecraft and they all lack any personality. While these drawbacks may seem severe, I find that the gameplay is excellent in most cases provided you learn how to use the wire system and are patient. My final downside for the game is actually related to its price. $28 USD for this is RIDICULOUS. I\u0027m glad I bought it in beta during the wedding sale ($22 for 2 copies). The game isn\u0027t worth over $15. If it wasn\u0027t so highly priced, I would have given it a 9, but it isn\u0027t worth the cost.… ",

But why is it a bad experience?Minecraft hasn\u0027t been a nice experience for me. Nothing more. Why? Minecraft is -not- a good gaming experience. I\u0027ve been playing ever since indev first came out, I was super excited whenever the SMP test server was on and I\u0027ve wasted hours upon hours just breaking blocks and placing them somewhere else, making cool creations which I\u0027m very proud of some. But why is it a bad experience? First off, there\u0027s no tutorial or whatsoever. You\u0027ll have no idea what to do on your first playthrough - luckily there\u0027s a fan made wiki which will supply you with detailed information about every aspect of the game - but WHY do we have to rely on these kind of sources? Why is there no official tutorial or instructions? I understand that some people enjoyed the aspect of exploring and finding things on their own - but goddamn there aren\u0027t even crafting instructions. The game itself plays off rather nicely at the start; you randomly break blocks, suddenly it\u0027s noon. You build a shelter and start collecting resources... Then what? Nothing. The game becomes bland. There\u0027s no objective or win-stage. If you\u0027re creative you might still have fun, designing small contraptions and stuff. Maybe after some time playing you\u0027ll have an objective set for yourself - which is just collecting resources. But there is only a handful of resources in the game, and it doesn\u0027t take long until you get them all. There are some other things that you can do, like build a portal to the nether, or travel to the end... but how are you supposed to know these things exist, without, once again, checking the wiki or getting help?? Everything is simply scattered around the game and the devs expect the player to find these elements on his own while in reality it\u0027s an impossible task without some sort of guide or help. Then there\u0027s multiplayer - a fresh aspect for the game. After you\u0027ve finished toying around with single player you\u0027ll probably want to try out multiplayer. But, guess what? There\u0027s no server list (only favorites), you have to type an IP of a server yourself - and where in the hell are you supposed to even get one? In addition to that there are no official game servers or a real way of obtaining a server IP other that asking a friend for a one or searching for a good one on the internet for countless hours. Once again, everything is simply scattered and feels unfinished. I\u0027ve been playing for a while, so I know how to play the game and what to do. But I almost never find myself just randomly playing. The game gets BORING and the oblivious devs completely didn\u0027t take that into account while making this. Let\u0027s leave the gameplay-wise section. The game itself, has poor graphics compared to other games todays. Notch\u0027s reason for using pixellated graphics is to maintain a \"retro\" feel. And I can accept that - but WHY does the game take up so many system resources!? I can run Skyrim, Crysis, L.A Noire and other games in the highest settings but this game just slows down after a while and slows down my entire computer. I have occasional lag spikes and even crashes from time to time. This proves Notch didn\u0027t care for performance and wanted to release his game asap just to get it out there and earn more money from critic reviews. The game is also COMPLETELY overpriced - I\u0027ve enjoyed The Binding of Isaac which is only 5$ MUCH more than I\u0027ve enjoyed this game - And I bought it when it was just 10 euros. It should\u0027ve stayed with that price, but it didn\u0027t. The game is also overpraised just because of what it\u0027s been through. All of the critics giving insanely high and undeserving scores have obviously played the game in the beta stage and were eagerly waiting for the game to come out so that they can review it. If the game DIDN\u0027T have an alpha-beta stage and would just come out as it is today without no one knowing about it previously it would\u0027ve gotten VERY low scores. It\u0027s a bad game. It would\u0027ve been BUTCHERED by critics. Heck, if I could show Notch what his game would become he would\u0027ve completely changed his plans. But instead he\u0027s money hungry. He has made so many promises that he didn\u0027t keep, like different gameplay modes or official mod support. I didn\u0027t even write about the other crummy features of the game in my review - like the so-called \"end\" - which is just a boring, artificially difficult boss fight, or the level up system which actually relies on the simple click-to-spam combat. There are even non-responsive NPCs in the game which Notch promised a long time ago but didn\u0027t have the patience/time/power to finish them. The game feels unfinished for an old player like me or confusing and bland for new player. It\u0027s shameful how it\u0027s getting these amazing scores from critics - it simply shouldn\u0027t. I\u0027m giving it a 4 because I did spend a lot of time playing it with friends, and made a few creations which felt mostly rewarding and even fun. Thanks for the read.… ",

A LOT. The world is your oyster in Minecraft. Want to build something magnificent? CHECK. Want to explore a new, random world every time you load? CHECK. Want to create weapons, machines, farm, raise livestock, fish, build your own world? CHECK. Want to explore caverns, search for rare gems/rocks, fight zombies \u0026 skeletons? CHECK. The point is, there is a lot to do, a lot to keep you entertained and it is worth every penny you will spend. What more do you want in a game? Truly, the only potential turnoff is the graphics. Some people will hate having a PC with a GTX 580 and playing a game that looks so archaic. I challenge those people to go DL a texture pack or just give it a shot.

People always say that the real fun is on multiplayer servers, yet the only thing I see are people running around in full diamond killing others as they spawn. Another thing that definitely brought the game to its low point was the complete lack of updates. From alpha to full release, only two hostile monsters were added (Enderman and Enderdragon). Notch killed the entire reputation of Minecraft by moving onto Scrolls with so many unfulfilled promises he made. The one that sticks out the most is the AI in NPCs; there is no dialogue whatsoever, no shops that you trade at, no quests, and they don\u0027t react to anything that\u0027s done to them at all. There are so many illogical things in the game to; if you eat zombie flesh, poisoning is supposed to cause harm to you, yet if you eat enough to bring your hunger bar to max, you\u0027ll be healed. The overall thing though is that the game doesn\u0027t last very long and new things such as mobs are very sparse.… ",

Many of my friends say there is nothing special about the game, It aways annoys me, It is one of the most editable games in history. Plus, along with the amazing amount of content that games like COD and BF3 lack, Theres a whole nice community supporting it. It has a HUGE selection of Mods to choose from, Even a computer mod!!!! If you dont like the \"rubbish and dull\" Graphics that the game possesses, You can choose from a variety of texture packs! Even make your own! That is the one thing most reviews are missing When my friends say \"ohh theres a New minecraft like game that has zombies in it!!!\" all I say is \"theres a modification for that!\" Im surprized that they just ignore me.They also said, \"theres a new game thats way better than minecraft that takes place on the moon!\" Again they never knew this but heres one thing again, \"theres a mod for that!\" Yup, The mod community is basically endless, You can even Play adventure maps on it! No more need To buy New map packs that cost nearly as much as Minecraft itself,So minecraft is a money saver,However, every game has its flaws, just like every human has their flaws. The two bad things about the game is The game needs a STRONG computer,To run like the big games like COD and BF3. another flaw is the many bugs the game has, the good thing is, if you are a good JAVA programmer, You prob can fix the bug yourself! But many people that are reading this are not good programmers. A Unique Thing about the game is that some of the previous bugs had a personality Like the score bug where when Instead of showing a number, It showed a score of \u0026e0 which I just ignored at first but Now I noticed that was a unique bug that was not nessisary to fix, That was a thing I am dissapointed about with minecraft, So overall, The game rates a 9 out of 10 But I want to soo badly Rate a 10.… ",

I liked the idea of dungeons and abadoned structures inside the world, but the game just can\u0027t focus on the mining aspects, but instead it\u0027s focusing on Dungeon Crawling RPGs. I think that\u0027s what the game was supposed to be, but I want more mining options in the later version. That\u0027s my main problem in the game. But so far, it\u0027s an Okay game. I can\u0027t rate it higher because this simple game can\u0027t run in a simple netbook. So one suggestions to Mojang, can you guys built-in the Optifine mod inside the game? There are tons of mods that can fix the game and tweak the game too, but the Vanilla isn\u0027t a recommendation for you guys. It\u0027s addicting, but disappointing too.

The openness - the level of customization in your creations only limited by the square shape of the game\u0027s blocks gives you an intriguing way to approach a landscape you can completely remove and mold to your liking. Want to build a town? Turn the world into a crater? A gauntlet of monsters? Farm chickens? Explore caves? All open options. I dumped many hours into this game. The only thing that keeps me from playing it now is the lack of stability in terms of servers being wiped, or updates requiring server wipes, corruption, etc. I wish I could still have all of my original creations and to have just continued to build on top of them. It\u0027s really disheartening losing out on old creations, but playing on the same server without ever needing a wipe/rebuild, the server going defunct because the person no longer wants to host it, massive game changes making it a near requirement to restart your server to be able to take advantage of the new content, and not being griefed in some capacity is pretty unlikely. It\u0027s a fun game, regardless. I just can\u0027t find myself playing it any more because I need 2 things - the ability to play with friends, and the ability to not have my creations thrown to the wind. But it seems you have to pick one or the other. If Notch can find a solution to this, I\u0027ll stick around. Perhaps a powerful map cut-and-paste type utility for you to transfer things from one server to another? A small file that can simply be opened and loaded into another server\u0027s map file, for example. That would be wonderful.… ",

It has so much you can do: explore caves. Fight endless hordes of undead creatures, giant spiders, and strange fiends that spawned in the imaginations of the creators. Explore down to the very bedrock of the world. Mine essential coal, valuable iron, amazing redstone, majestic lapis lazuli, brilliant gold, heavy-duty diamonds, and of course the second-hardest material in the game, obsidian. Create impenetrable fortresses on the highest mountain, underwater, in a cliff face, or underground. Build complicated traps, locks, doorbells, gates, and more with redstone. Brew potions that can change the tide of battle. Enchant weapons, tools, and armor to give it a shiny bling and extra abilities. All this, and even more in multiplayer. Make a shop, start a city, dominate your enemies, found an alliance, rise to become a moderator, or even an admin, and more. And to think that the game started off with just one person. And the full version isn\u0027t the end. They still update it. They continue to add new wonders and horrors to the game. New mob AI\u0027s, including zombie \"super-soldiers\". Jungles. Ocelots. Spawner eggs. All of these things have been added or will be added to the game in the future, as well as many other updates. This is truly an amazing game and is a world of never-ending fun.… ",

If you use mods it can be a very fun game. Multiplayer is much fun. You can play with friends on multiplayer. So I would only recommend it to people that know how to install mods, and play multiplayer else it isn\u0027t a very good game for you",

While it is still lacking, however, the constant updates are nice and I do believe that there is a LOT more to come. *Note that this is my first review so pardon if I\u0027m doing something wrong* The bad: With a lack of a tutorial or even an in-game book that records what you have crafted for later use, the game drops the player flat on his face and then forces you to learn how to actually use the game using online wikis and things of the sort. I\u0027ve been hiding behind the fact that Minecraft was in beta and that everything will be polished out in the full release... WRONG. The game has a lot of nice aspects but fails to deliver things that would incorporate casual players into the mix. The game is severly lacking in the multiplayer section and uses a clunky server-ip system that I would have thought would be nicely fleshed out. Setting up a server for you and your friends is all-too much of a hassle to be considered a \"good\" experience. The only boss in the game is an \"ender-dragon\" which features more or less redundant A.I. The only thing that really tells you that it\u0027s a boss is it\u0027s absurdly high amount of health that\u0027s constantly regenerating due to these \"towers.\" The boss isn\u0027t so much fun as it is just plain annoying. After I wasted that 15 minutes of my life, all I had to show for it was a boring screen of just text. I DID get a ****-load of experience, but what does that do IF THE BOSS IS ALREADY DEAD? The good: The game aims to be an interactive sandbox and does a very good job of doing so. Players are put into an infinite, randomly-generated/ing world in survival mode and are forced to gather materials in order to survive. At night, or in any dark area, monsters appear. The player must build up defenses as he mines materials. These materials can be put together to create more elaborate items, or \"crafted\" items: hence the name \"Mine\"-\"Craft\". The game even features a basic form of circuitry called redstone that the player can manipulate with pistons and buttons to create the grandest of button-operated doors, monster traps, or whatever your heart desires. The idea of a monster being able to creep up on you at any given moment and scare you ****-less just adds to the suspense. The best thing about Minecraft, however, is that the experience is yours; you build what YOU want to build. The idea of spending time doing something that has an awesome outcome just invokes this sense of accomplishment in the player. The things that you build are constantly evolving in trivial little bursts at a time into something amazing that YOU built. Bottom line: While the game DOES have a lot of gameplay, the Mojang team is spending too much time expanding on content when the game SHOULD be working on the features it promised so long ago. The game still doesn\u0027t feel finished, but that\u0027s not to draw away from what is, in the end, an amazing experience.… ",

I could rant and rave on what is good, but my favorable score show show that. I\u0027m going to write the short-comings because people need to understand what they are gonna either miss or want. Firstly, when you get in the game, you can do whatever you want, but that is a downside. For the not very creative people (like me), it is hard to keep playing the game when I don\u0027t have an end-goal to achieve. You can explore FOREVER and will get lost and if you die and are lost? Say good bye to whatever you were carrying. Secondly, from the beta days to now the weekly snapshots, it has gone from a creative little world to an adventure mode that has again no goal. You can explore and find a village, but it doesn\u0027t necessarily help you. You can enchant weapons/items to help you, but it isn\u0027t necessary. It gives you freedom to do what you want, but with no guidance, what\u0027s the point? Thirdly, Mods and add-ons. The game does a great job with allowing the player to do what they want, but it gets outrageous. They allow people to add their own texture packs, but not the mods to allow users to accomplish their personal goals quicker. For example, what if I am building a tower? I need a \"flying\" mod so I don\u0027t need to worry about falling and dying. Every update/release you would have to re-install the mods. I know Mojang does not specifically support the mods system, but since EVERYONE is using them, why not just add that in? The multiplayer in the game is great, and can be amazing when you have a server filled with people who help each other, but you always get griefers who want to watch the world burn.… ",

I started with an outdated version and even that had me impressed and hooked. A couple of weeks later I got my hands on the beta and a whole new adventure started. Minecraft delivers a nearly endless world for you to mess around in. It throws some hostile spiders, skeletons, zombies and some explosive creatures called creepers at you at the same time. You have to survive and keep yourself out of danger, but at the same time you can dig deeper into the world and discover rare minerals and dangerous dungeons, all can be used to upgrade your amor, or obtain some rare blocks for that epic wizard\u0027s tower you\u0027re building. The gameplay is basic; You can walk, sneak, punch, run and jump. To be honest, you don\u0027t need much more. It gives you the opportunities you need, and that\u0027s what this game is all about. I\u0027ve seen quite an amount of people complain about its graphics. Now, I really do like these fancy, shiny Fps-graphics as much as anyone, but even though they may seem sloppy and effortless, it works well with the rest of the game. There\u0027s even an opportunity to change all of your textures, even though you shouldn\u0027t have to mod your game to enjoy it. The multiplayer; the heart and core of Minecraft. Even if you only decide to play some basic survival with a mate, or join a hardcore pvp-server, the multiplayer will be what really blows you away. You have ENDLESS possibilities, and that is exactly what makes this game what it is. It\u0027s what you and your multiplayer friends make it; amazing.… ",

Offline play quickly becomes boring though. Once you create your masterpieces, you have no one to show it to and the game is just repetitive after a short while.

    "comments": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view. Minecraft is a game that puzzles me. It is built in java, which fans seem to praise, but in actuality is either very lazy, very stupid, or both. Java is not supposed to operate a game of this magnitude,and the only reason I can see for it is that Notch didn\u0027t want to step out of the comfort zone of his high school language of choice. It\u0027s the reason the code is so buggy, and the game freezes and lags on the best machines around. But on to the game. I understand the graphics were supposed to be stylistic and retro, and it works to a degree, so I won\u0027t complain too much there. It\u0027s gameplay that the game lacks. You start with nothing, and have to build a universe, which is cool, except that you have to actually build it. Instead of a shop or something where you bring wood, stone, string, or whatever, your 3x3 grid becomes your personal hell. Arrange the right things with one object a space off, and the crafting doesn\u0027t work. sometimes the supplies don\u0027t make sense at all, and you end up asking a friend how to make something. The game forces you to use the wiki eventually. It\u0027s impossible not to, because of objects being reliant on pinpoint accuracy. Who would guess that a box of stone with the center piece missing is a forge? You better, or the game won\u0027t work, because you need a forge to get metals. Good luck without them. Quickly, you stop exploring the world and figuring things out, and begin minimizing the game and checking the wiki every 10 minutes. After that, the game is only fun for a few days. So to recap: Java isn\u0027t for games like this, even a $1000 computer still freezes occasionally, and the game requires knowledge that you cannot gain inside the game.… ",

The mechanics are boring and overly repetitive, and is not worth the 20 dollars it costs. Do not buy this game, go with Terraria or Garry\u0027s Mod, which are both excellent sandbox games. Minecraft however, isn\u0027t, so don\u0027t buy it!",

That\u0027s like saying Gary\u0027s Mod is repetitious (you just fool around in the game). This game is very well done. For people who DON\u0027T know *cough zero rating reviewers cough*, there is actually an avenue for those wishing to go beyond the sandbox aspect. You can level up and equip and enchant your equipment in preparation for taking on the Ender Dragon. It is a very difficult monster that you have to kill. However, if you didn\u0027t take the time to actually explore the game and simply paid the money to buy the single player because of the hype and then dropped the game, you wouldn\u0027t know that would you? I highly recommend this game. The sandbox aspect allows you to build amazing creations that you could only see in your imagination (and thanks to the somewhat quirky engineering physics, you can really do some amazing things). The survival aspect gives you something to do from the start and makes the game more interesting from the second you are dropped into the middle of your randomized world. The end game dragon gives you something to work towards (and if you die, you lose your equipment, making taking on the Ender Dragon something you really have to prepare for). All in all, a very well rounded and strong game.… ",

I can see the audience was dedicated to people under 12 years old which is fine but for people older than that it\u0027s going to be hard to like. Think LEGO but 3d world where everything consists of blocks - squares I mean. Even though it\u0027s not a final game and will probably never be it goes through continual updates, has a great and expansive community (with millions of vids on youtube) and a lot of mods! This is one of the few games that supports PC gaming and I like it for that. I might give it a low score but that\u0027s only from my perspective, my point of view based on my gameplay experience. It\u0027s in BETA still I think but for $20 and if you like creativity and building you\u0027ll be able to pick this up and enjoy it. However if your older and your only getting it \u0027cos your friends have it - DON\u0027T, watch some gameplay or look at reviews and see if you\u0027d like this game. It\u0027s very different I admit, simple albeit disappointing graphics but that\u0027s not what the game\u0027s all about and focused on, good games don\u0027t need good graphics but in 2012 there should be some improvement. On fast PC\u0027s it\u0027ll run average, the draw distance is not good and if you go somewhere too fast it\u0027ll slow down and load the rest of the area which is infinite really but it shouldn\u0027t need to, not on good PC\u0027s anyway. I think it was optimised poorly for modern day PC\u0027s and was taking old computers such as linux and XP so they\u0027d both have a similar experience and not be disadvantaged when online - yes u can build together and destroy people\u0027s property but there\u0027s ton of hackers also which can be annoying. The fact is the game engine it runs on does not improve or run better on modern PC\u0027s it simply doesn\u0027t. Fan-made stuff is always, also good but all those new items and they can\u0027t make curved or round objects? I like squares but why not circles or spheres, also - that\u0027s the first thing that comes to mind and it needs, the game runs slow just on square objects loading, I thought that\u0027d be added by now but all those updates and it hasn\u0027t come up - maybe they want it all square, fair enough. Right-angle camera at 90^o when turning can be annoying and some of the game loads slowly as mentioned prior to this sentence. Again textures sometimes look bad but with mods and seriously everything can be edited in this game it\u0027s just all possible but the game does hurt my eyes sometimes, I\u0027ll be honest. There are lots of things it can improve on and another would be a plot or setting or even storyline - not even, just a setting- not just a minecraft universe and something to add fan-made stuff in-game like Valve\u0027s (STEAM) own Garry\u0027s Mod - toybox mode where you can just instantly download objects and add them straight in or something. It is inventive, inituitive but does have some frustrating problems or things I see as detrimental to my playing experience or things I think shouldn\u0027t be needed to be mentioned to play. Still millions of people have claimed this game in alpha stage and once you pay your $20 at the Minecraft (MC) site you get the full game \u0027till it\u0027s fully finished and in it\u0027s final stage or release with all the bells and whistles - updates. To be honest this game is the best sandbox \u0027cos there\u0027s no boundaries, limits and you can build everything but you can\u0027t DO everything or anything for that matter. It does feel a bit akward to play sometimes and kind of a lost idea but it has been implemented brilliantly as a low-budget indie game and for what it\u0027s worth it can be fun for young gamers, it stays true to what PC games should do for fans and is a game I can\u0027t see (but is going to be) put on consoles as it\u0027s just too big and even on modern PC\u0027s has troubles because of the game engine - problem mentioned beforehand but maybe that\u0027ll be changed in the future. To make it short, this game is fun but can/can be and sometimes is over-rated. Again it\u0027s a good game and does deserve some credit for being an original game, allowing the user to create and explore and doing it in a fun and I guess some-what educational way. There\u0027s another game which has copied this design but with better graphics - sure it\u0027s good and I\u0027d probably play it but I can\u0027t stand to see or support a game which has copied it\u0027s design completely, simply put. \u0027Nuff (enough) said. 7/10!… ",

Yes it was \"better\" in the fact that it had more features but it wasn\u0027t the game I fell in love with in those alpha and pre 1.8 beta stages. I remember discovering redstone and having no clue what it was, having the game minimized so that I could look up the crafting recipes on the wiki, painfully discovering only 2 diamonds and never finding anymore and eventually getting so lost and deciding that I would never find my house again. So I deleted the world. I actually felt something, that I had lost everything I had done in that world and it really mattered to me. Looking back I realise that my water trench could have been better if I had used buckets and that my infinite water reserve actually didn\u0027t work, that I could smelt the cobblestone in my house to make it stone and make it prettier and I could have probably discovered more iron and diamonds if I had dug deeper. Now days I can\u0027t stop deleting worlds because \"their not quite right\". RIP Minecraft I loved you and I will treasure those moments we had together but now it\u0027s time to move on.

It basically comes down to who has farmed enough items and has spent enough hours playing the game to get the better loot. Multiplayer (without a whitelist) is absolute mayhem. Most of the server \"owners\" are 15 years old or a furry. (Usually both) This leads to you getting banned from servers because the owner was mad because he was picked on in school that day, you have a skin they don\u0027t like, or you killed an animal (and furries evidentally hate that). In conclusion, the game gets boring very quickly and a community that is full of furries, children and homosexuals makes it even worse. So, unless you are one of the above mentioned, you will want to steer far clear from this game as it will dillude your mind and pull you into those digusting and appalling fandoms.

Despite this Minecraft feels somewhat incomplete though every block of it is still worth what you paid for.",

Also other Minecraft things. It still get updated which is good. The thing I don\u0027t like is, that the game can end. I don\u0027t like that. By the way this is a sandbox game, as you might know. Its very blocky, 16X16 pixels, so you don\u0027t need a good graphic card, but you\u0027ll need a good RAM. Because Minecraft use alot of RAM, it have to load chunk all the time, so it will lag. he start of the game is the best, you don\u0027t know what to do and all that. But later when you have played the game alot, you now what to do. And you will never get that feeling you had, when you first played it, for the first time. I can recommend this game to everyone, young or elder. Maybe not a 90 year old man, but grown-ups can also play this. PLEASE don\u0027t hear what other people say about this game, even though they say this game is great. It is YOUR opinion, so if you like it, buy it. This is one of my favourite games.… ",

I understand the amount of bugs, but there are no game-breaking bugs, and it is probably the most ambitious game out there.

There is obviously no game in the world that you can literally do ANYTHING, but with just the stuff you start out with (not counting mods), you can do so much and build anything. Even contraptions! Now, to all the people that say that the graphics are bad, first of all its an indie game and its supposed to look like that. If you don\u0027t like it, get a texture pack! Its as easy as that! Also, to the people who say some things (like the NPCs) don\u0027t have much of a use, do you really think they are going to just leave them like that? If anything, you yelling at them probably makes them want to fix things LESS. Minecraft is my favorite game, and no matter how much it changes, they so far have only added and fixed more and more things, so, it just gets better.… ",

Another thing, when they said Minecraft was going to be finished in 1.0.0, I was SO excited. No more updates! No more waiting for mods that could barely keep up! I could get all the mods I wanted, and not have to worry about updates! Of course, that wasn\u0027t true, was it Notch? He began updating again. What the ****. He just couldn\u0027t stop updating the game! And these came faster and faster, 1 every week or two! It was insane! Most modders didn\u0027t even bother to try and update their mods, because the new updates were pouring out so fast. Not only that, but it started out extremely cheap, then got to about $14 to $15 by beta 1.7.3, and now, after the \"finished game\" was released, it\u0027s around $20+ dollars! I like the game every once in a while, but after playing for a while, it\u0027s really boring and it seems to be the same process every world you make.… ",

There\u0027s nothing much like minecraft. It\u0027s a game that never ends. There\u0027s only black and white, no gray. Personally I love the game. If you can call it a game. There are no real rules or boundaries that make it a game, and that\u0027s why it\u0027s so great. If you like to play something in which you can build whatever you want with virtual lego blocks, then you\u0027ll have a blast, because that\u0027s all you really do here. I mean you eat and survive and mine the materials in which you build. Though it comes down to you and you\u0027re creations, as well as playing online with others to build with and explore new areas with to get resources. Personally I like playing with a friend or community, otherwise it becomes quite boring playing on your own single player game. I would recommend this game to anyone that is into building virtual structures, and to nobody that isn\u0027t. Minecraft is for a very select. Playing such a game it\u0027s quite astonishing to find that select is so large.… ",

I first found out about Minecraft in about late 2010 when my bro saw this youtuber (who used to make ROBLOX videos) play, well, Minecraft. My brother and I loved (And still love) Lego, building blocks and stuff like that. We seemed quite interested in Minecraft. My brother and I we loved creating things and building things. So I visited minecraft.net to find out more about this game. I tried Minecraft Classic to see what the game mechanics were like. When the game was in Beta 1.1 (I think) I bought it with my savings. Well let me tell you I simply fell in love with it. Even though at that time there was so little content a 1-year-old\u0027s brain is like Middle Earth compared to it (lame metaphor, don\u0027t ask.) I just loved the fact that I could build anything I want and do anything I want. It was pretty much MY land. The soundtrack was also really beautiful and it somehow motivated me to build more. Since there was no in-game tutorial I had to refer to the wiki and Youtube videos almost 100% of the time. On my first day I didn\u0027t know what to do so I built a nice little dirt hut (Doesn\u0027t everyone do that?) and started chopping wood from trees with my fists. When I gathered enough wood I built some tools (Had to refer to the wiki for that) and it was already night. When I ran to my hut some kind of green lizard ran up to me and literally suicide-bombed me. Well, yeah that\u0027s my first night. I think Minecraft started off with good intentions. Even with a really buggy multiplayer and almost as buggy singleplayer the game\u0027s still just fine for me. Graphics aren\u0027t a problem for me either, I can play tetris for hours and still be entertained. I guess the problem (at that time and probably now) was the lack of content. In my opinion I think It must be hard for Notch to add more content without spoiling Minecraft\u0027s vanilla (I hope I\u0027m using the right words). Even now, Jeb who if I\u0027m not mistaken is developer for Minecraft now, is technically adding much more content in the risk of probably spoiling the game (No offense Jeb). The addition of RPG-ish content (potions, enchanting, Dragons, NPCs, etc.) seems more like a mod than original vanilla. NPCs not doing anything is no problem, I just blow them up, I just think that most of the game is left really unfinished. Most of the content added by Notch was sadly, done better by modders. The game probably isn\u0027t worth it is now, which makes me glad I bought it in Beta. The longer you play Minecraft the novelty and fun of the game will sadly, ware off. Minecraft is a beautiful game which seems to have slightly lazy developers, some unnecessary content, innovative gaming style, nostalgic soundtrack and a game which I think you may need to be creative enough to truly enjoy it. I really recommend you to buy this game, if you\u0027re a guy who likes to spend his time on building, exploring, battling monsters, \u0027derping\u0027 around or just exploding stuff. If you\u0027re a fan of exciting storyline games, games with good graphics (Not that Minecraft has bad graphics), games which are focused on combat violence or such then I think Minecraft wouldn\u0027t really be worth your cash. I f you read this review until the end, then thanks for your time, I hope this review was alright for a first. Sorry if there were any wrong sentences, incorrect usage of words, misspellings or such, I\u0027m only 13 and I wrote this on an Ipad 2 (Don\u0027t ask).… ",

I have been checking up with Minecraft since its alpha stages, back when the only player modes were some weird survival and creative, and zombies dropped feathers. People like to root for the underdog, and I understand. So, of course, people root for Notch. But if you separate yourself from the emotions and the novelty, you realize that Minecraft is vastly unfinished upon release. Promises made by Notch, for example, included various game modes like capture the flag, and a fully-functioning NPC village, among others I won\u0027t even bother listing. Yes, I play this game. I do like it to some degree, which is why I\u0027m giving it a 4 out of 10. But the reality is that, when you compare it to everything on the market, nay, just compare it to other indie games, and you realize just how hard Notch dropped the ball on this one. The graphics are atrocious, and the term \"retro graphics\" don\u0027t justify it. Chrono Trigger is \"retro\" and still a beautiful game, so calling something retro to justify it being plain and ugly is awful. The music is serene, but nice. The combat is unvaried and unfortunately dull when it comes to the majority of the game, but the brewing/potion system and enchanting added a little to the game. Shame your only two real weapons are swords and bows. The strength in Minecraft\u0027s programming comes from Jeb and, guess what, people other than Team Mojang. It\u0027s the mods and add-ons that aren\u0027t from Team Mojang that make this game actually fun and entertaining, and people tend to forget that. If you mod the heck out of it, great, fantastic, good game. But stand-alone it\u0027s an incredibly monotonous, uninspired simulator.… ",

A lot of the updates created last year are so irrelevant, considering it is a lot different than what it was then. You can now change texture packs with ease, for those who have too much swagger for the default. You can try a survival mode and get the blocks yourself, or try a creative world and have them from the start. It is too repetitive for some people, but many of them lack the creative spark it takes to enjoy it. Many architects and non-gamers play this religiously, because it gives them the chance to express their creativity in a way no other game really could. The singeplayer mode by itself does get boring after a while for most players, which is why the multiplayer mode brings some players back. You can play on a server with your friends, and play from the beginning with your friends. You could spawn 1000 mooshrooms in a hole and blow them up, or race to the top of a ladder by killing everyone else on it (invented by the Mindcrack dudes). The possibilities are endless, and will be as each update comes. Your opinion may have changed since alpha. It has for a lot of people. Many different mods allow you to play it the old way, or some which make it even harder. Instead of complaining that it\u0027s overrated, you can play an unknown indie game to make yourself feel better. Minecraft will hopefully have updated several times before you come back.… ",

At the $10 price for the alpha it was great and even at $20 I think is fair enough despite it\u0027s shortcomings. It is now $30 which is too much for an incomplete product.

The whole concept had literally endless potential. At the $10 price for the alpha it was great and even at $20 I think is fair enough despite it\u0027s shortcomings. It is now $30 which is too much for an incomplete product. I stopped paying it during the Beta and went back for 1.2.5 only to find that almost nothing changed. The game still had the same inherent limits and problems due to poor core coding on Notches part. The game still lacked proper modding support (which was promised), lacked optimized graphics for low end systems. Still ran poorly on Java (Java is fine but you have to optimize). The part that blows me away is that Mojang made so much money from this small game that you would think they could hire 1 guy to add content and even create proper DLC. The survival mode is still stale and only fun for a several hours until you realize that there is nothing to do once you built your home, mineshaft, and farm. What amazes me is the amount of nothing coming out of Mojang, several modders take time out of their day to provide all the basics that the game is missing via mods and what does Mojang do? Release a patch to break over half of them. The funniest part is how long it takes them to put something out after Notch says he \"likes the idea\". I remember reading a tweet about the fence doors which took months to get released meanwhile a modder had already made one in about an hour. I don\u0027t blame the whole company for dropping the ball on Minecraft, I think what it is is the code they worked with was so bad (Notch) that it was extremely difficult, time consuming, and probably had to be hacked in anyway to get anything added. Notch probably decided to spend more time/money on a new project (Scrolls, which will flop) instead of spending 10x the time to implement something in Minecraft for free. Overall, fun game that had a lot of potential but fell in the lap of someone who lacks creativity and vision. Sure he made a lot of money but if he was more careful and invested a little bit more into Minecraft it would have been a timeless platform for selling DLC packs and official \"Mods\" for years - think space, crazy dimensions, Heaven, etc).… ",

Creative, allows you to build anything you could imagine! You can make things from houses to castles, computers to gadgets, (yes you can make computers). Survival, is a mode in which you start out with nothing, and have to collect resources to survive. It can be a little scary so beware of that, but you can set your difficulty on 4 different modes, peaceful is one that doesn\u0027t have monsters or scary music, and you die from less explicit things like hunger, and falling. There is no blood in this game either, and you don\u0027t necessarily have to kill EVERYTHING you see... They add new things to the game all the time too! Which i think is really cool. There is one, bad thing about this game though. It is extremely addictive. I can hardly ever stay away from this game. Thats how fun it is! But its bad that i spend a lot of my time on it.… ",

It was initially a fabulous game. But that was when Notch was actually doing what he said he would. This was initially an unfinished game under construction, but the construction has stopped for the most part. It takes the game devs months to come out with tiny updates, and those updates are almost always stolen ideas from the modding fan base. If he\u0027s going to use the modders\u0027 idea, he should make a software that helps easily find and install good mods. Instead, he makes it as hard a possible to install a mod, for the sole purpose of stealing their ideas. Take a look at pistons. The pistons mod was out much earlier than the update. So many people are too blind to take off their nostalgia glasses and look at the reality of the game. Minecraft isn\u0027t a game. Is a foundation for the game. And the ones who are making the real game are the modders, who Notch steals from without crediting. The updates have stopped coming, he\u0027s deceiving his growing fan base, and committing theft against people who have tried their hardest to make their mark on the gaming community. Far too many people are patient with this game, though the updates don\u0027t come and it\u0027s but a shell, a skeleton yet to be fleshed out. This game doesn\u0027t even have it\u0027s basics down yet, the combat is a painful distraction to whatever you\u0027re trying to accomplish, yet the game feels empty without it. The reason for that is that the game is ,in fact empty, and the combat system is just a shroud for that. This game lacks the detail and content which thirty dollars is worth, and though I do play it, it is with many mods. This game is incomplete, yet tries to pass itself off as if it were a full game, which is nothing but horrible deception. The bias of the \"Critics\" is beyond demented, and it\u0027s like that for many games. Check the user reviews, understand that the critics are critics, not gamers, not players, but critics. This game is a plague on the community until Notch gets off his high horse and realises that Minecraft is still an incomplete piece of crap.… ",

At one point, I was one of those people but now, I\u0027ve lost interest. With update after update Mojang put in little things, from TESTIFICATES (thats what I call them now :P) to new biomes, but to be honest, It isn\u0027t enough! If you don\u0027t know what Minecraft is, you\u0027ve probably been living under a rock, but for those 3 people... Minecraft is an open-ended experience where you wander around a bright and colourful world composed of blocks: this is a major characteristic of Minecraft because the game allows you to break the aforementioned blocks with tools to get materials. You can then use these materials to do whatever you feel like. At first glance it looks like a boner-fide lego clone, but then you see a skeleton ride a spider, then the lego comparison goes out the window. The game has you survive the dangerous night-time. monsters tend to spawn in darkness so when it gets dark, they come in packs. This is where you usually start to dig undergound to find important ores like iron and coal. If you\u0027re lucky you may find lapiz lazuli of even diamond. This gives Minecraft an addictive edge. You want to find diamond, but it\u0027s rare, so you gotta dig deeper and deeper and... deeper... ugh. since the official release the game now has mines and strongholds underground which gives a bit of spice to going down-under: you may find labrynthene, albeit very repetitive structures that you can explore and... not much else. they are just there, with not much of a purpose. The graphics are simplistic, but not distractingly so. true they can be a bit boring at times, but you can always just download a texture pack to resolve that. The music is great, full of atmosphere, but I do wish that there were more tracks. what\u0027s there though is fantastic. Y\u0027see, I should like this game, but after a while, I start to get really REALLY bored. there\u0027s only so much building, wandering and scouring the undergrouth for materials I can do before it really wears on me. If it didn\u0027t for you, great but Minecraft in my opinion is WAAAAAAAY over-rated. the official release doesen\u0027t have enough new content to really call it a finished game. I know i\u0027m not gonna change anybody\u0027s mind, because you have already dicided: you either love or hate the game. I fall somewhere in between.… ",

The worlds are basically infinite, larger than the Earth. This is a game for creative minds and creative people, this game may not look it for some people, but when you begin to play it, you are into it right away until you hit diamonds or any modded ores, items, blocks, etc. I have seen this game in schools to teach people certain things. This game is far more fun than Call of Duty, even though they are in different game genres. I highly recommend this game for everyone that brings gameplay over graphics.… ",

Sadly though, the \"finished product\" lacks so much of the charm from the alpha verisons and more importanltly feels like a very unfinished product. Notch is great in a lot of ways but to me, it feels like he rushed the release version for more profits which he honestly didnt need at that point and in doing so left his early fans dissapointed. The villager AI is basically non existant and I beleive they should have just been left out, it used to be you where the only humanoid in this world and that gave you a sense of that lone wolf lone survivor feel which was terrific. IF the villages had some decent AI this wouldnt be a problem but now they feel tacked on and pointless. The combat could have been so much more, but as it is, it is nothing but rapid mouse clicks, no thought AT ALL to strategy and some will argue thats not the point to minecraft but those people honestly dont realize that in a survival mode game, combat is the key element that seperates it from creative mode. Lastly, the survival mode promised since alpha was never released which was a big let down and I feel its because Notch figured he made his money from the game, why put more money into it to keep his fans happy. For alpha all of these downfalls were forgiven since hey, it was ALPHA, but for a supposedly fineshed product, it sure does not feel like one. I feel that a 7 is a fair score.… ",

It\u0027s a fact. Many people complain about it\u0027s fun/price rate, but honestly I find the price correct. People tend to spend way more money on far less interactive games. (by the time I write this, I could pre-order black ops II for more than double the price of MC, and it will be probably about 5 hrs of the well known linear gameplay and of course many hours of unimaginative pew-pew multiplayer) So the price is fine. If you feel cheated after buying MC just because you\u0027ve \"heard good things about it\" it is probably not your type of game. It isn\u0027t a fast paced action game, it is rather about exploring, planning, building. It requires ideas first, and patience to make those plans come to life. Combat is quite a minor aspect of the game, therefore you can simply play in creative mode or simply turn off mobs in survival as well. Yes it has bugs. But at least you get those fixes AND improvements fro free. Still better than paying for new and new DLCs imho. You get bored after some time? So what? I get bored of any game if playing it for weeks constantly. But in minecraft there is still the possibility to dust it off even after a year and spend another month playing it. I call this acceptable. I tend to spend money only on those games that contain at least 5 days of gameplay, this is why I only buy RPGs AND minecraft. So stop complaining and don\u0027t expect this game to be something else that it was supposed to be. About flaws: AI needs much improvement. In 1.2.5 developers spent many time improving the ocelot\u0027s (?!!?) AI, but still villagers tend to jump off cliffs, killing themselves. And some improved interaction with NPCs would be nice. Maybe more and bigger pre-generated towns. (maybe it\u0027s just me, but I love to defend and improve these premade settlements) I\u0027d also love to choose starting biomes. I mean when I start a new survival map I hate to spawn in a desert or on a tiny island in the middle of nowhere, mainly because I don\u0027t want to wander too far from my spawn location. All in all, Minecraft is a very unique game, no1 in it\u0027s genre. If you enjoy building, fooling around without any consequences, you should absolutely buy it, look at it as a long time investment, since you\u0027ll be able to play and enjoy it even after months of a break.… ",

Putting all of that aside, one gets to the downsides. Graphics are not the best (perhaps that is intentional), the music is horrific, and I encounter bugs such as re-spawning in a weird place.

New patches add more reasons to go and find him, and more bosses are planned, but with no tutorial, a new player is easily lost. However, the best thing about minecraft is not the game, but the content. It may have been released a while back, but the new content continues to fly out Mojangs door. Many complain of the bugs in the game, but that is to be expected with new content. There never seems to be an end to the content, although the wait time between patches is long.

The gameplay is a little confusing at first because the game has very little to almost no instruction besides that it tells you how to open your inventory and i can almost guarantee you that you can not play this game without some kind of reference but once you get around it it\u0027s not that big of a problem. The game experience mostly relies on what you make of it, there are plenty of mods for the game that will greatly enhance the game even if you don\u0027t enjoy the vanilla experience, how ever alone the game \"Depending on how you play\" will eventually get old at some point but eventually you might find yourself enjoying the same experience, exploring the land and finding it\u0027s rewards that lie beneath the surface which is one of my personal favorite things to do because the world is randomly generated. the art style is simplistic and quirky, but even if you dont like the art style you can find plenty of custom textures made by the community. however the game does require a sturdy set up for as of recent update the game runs on an internal server. its a fun game as is but some people tend to find that the original alpha and beta gameplay is more fun than it\u0027s full release but there are mods that revert it. i must admit the game is extremely over rated so if it were not for that then this would have gotten a 9. and as for the music which plays randomly is relaxing but can be a bit repetitive. minecraft is a fun experience that plenty of people will enjoy with no true objectives and yet almost a completely customizable challenge that you will likely enjoy.… ",

It\u0027s also an excellent babysitter. Seriously set a kid up in a Minecraft world they wont leave the computer. All jokes aside theres no other game that really intrudes on Minecraft\u0027s genre. If I were to define \"Sandbox\" I would say \"Minecraft\". On top of being fun in Vanilla this game is veryyyy easily modded. Technic pack is one of my favorites because I don\u0027t actually have to mess with Minecraft\u0027s files. It creates it\u0027s own directory. Although Technic does add a whole new meaning to the word \"lost\". Overall I\u0027ve had a lot of fun with my blocky creations and because of an internet cap I can\u0027t play multiplayer.

If you can picture Legos in a survival dimension against pixel monsters and the ability to fight them or avoid them in various ways, you\u0027d be grazing the tip of the iceberg that is Minecraft. Literally this game has no specific \"goal.\" Some players would argue otherwise, but really, the point of Minecraft is pure creativity. It doesn\u0027t get better than being able to build a house, dig for materials to build said house, and fend off various monsters in the night! Whether you\u0027re having a peaceful building game where you construct whatever your mind can fathom or you\u0027re surviving by the skin of your teeth in hardcore mode, Minecraft is sure to give a new experience every time you play it. How awesome is this! But how could Mojang (the developers) make it better? Multiplayer? You mean I can now build and/or survive with my best friends? I can either ally myself with them or fight against them as I see fit? This game is incredible. Literally, Minecraft comes to a new level as it employs a wonderful multiplayer experience with other players. Combining creativity and ingenuity together as you build the ultimate creation! What will your mind(s) think of next? My only negative is that the price for the game has consistently increased since the time I bought my copy in Alpha. What was $5 is now almost $30. I wouldn\u0027t give a game like this that high of a price, but Mojang has to make money in some way and some respect is deserved there. Definitely loads of fun for any creative gamer and something I will say should be in your gaming library even if you only play it on a rainy day!… ",

Because like my friend Thomas is fond of saying, \"this isn\u0027t really a game, it\u0027s a system for tapping into a deep seated cognitive bias: that we all want to create.\" Perhaps story writing can be simplified further. In a way, blogs, D\u0026D, TheSims, Civilization, and Neverwinter nights have made that possible, but it isn\u0027t yet easy enough to link words, and music, and visual content.

I loved every secound of it, i could never wait to get out of scool just to play it! i wanted to do everything, collect every block, kill every zombie, sheep, spider, craft everything, build a cool house and i did! but there was something that allways made me stop playing. something that made me loose intrest. I ussaly started a new game every time i played but i never knew why... now i know. this game is pointless. there is no point in anything you do. you can kill all the zombies collect all the blocks build as many houses as you want but it will now feel rewarding in any way. it seems that most people look at the ultamate goal of this game to collect damounds. and what do you do with them? MAKE A FREAKING DIAMOUND PIC? and what do you do after that? look for more diamounds. that\u0027s all there was to this game just collect stuff. there was little no notheng you could do with all the most rare things like gold, iron and diamounds besides buiding more tools to get more diamounds. but they\u0027ve updated the game a lot but it fells like every update has made the game easier! the hunger gave you regenerating hp the sprinting made it possible to run from spiders the armor update made the armor last at least 10X more and the list goes on. even with all these updates there is still notheng to do in this game. all you do is collect rare items. it\u0027s sad rly that this game is so popular. i\u0027m gona talk about some of the updates: the enchantment table interduced an rpg element to the game where by you kill enemys and anamals and get ep to gain levels. you use the levels to upgrade you weapons and armor but this is so pointless it\u0027s sad. the only way to level up is to grind zombie after zombie, skellaton after skellaton ec. and what do you get fro this grind? better gear. what\u0027s the point? you are able to defend your self just fine without enchantments and there is not rly any monster you need to fight. keep in mind it\u0027s hard to explain why this game is so bad and i\u0027m trying to explain it as best i can. there is also multyplayer but that\u0027s just as pointless. in multyplayer you are just doing the same pointless thinks with a friend. you can build a house and collect diamounds but that\u0027s pointless. it feels like minecraft doesn\u0027t know what kind of game it is. is it a survival game? is it a fighting game? is it an rpg? is it a building game? it is all and none of those things. it does not know what it is suposed to be and these \"updates\" are making the game worse if anything. i think that the thing i tought the most when playing the game is \"what should i do now?\" i never knew what to do because there is no goal! the game is pointless! there are bad games out there many worse than this one but they all have a point where you start, something you have to do, and a point where you end the game and win. i know there are mods for the game and i\u0027ve moded the crap out of minecraft many times but even with them the game still feels emty. you can get a mod that adds more monsters to fight but there is no reward for fighting. you can get a mod that lets you create a mineing mechene but there is no point in mineing you can get a mod to give you airplanes to fly around and explore the worl. but there is no point in exploring! THIS GAME HAS NOOOO POINT! NO REWARD FOR DOING ANYTHING! they would have to do a lot to make this game fun for me witch i dubt they will do, now they\u0027re trying to relese this pointless game on more platforms to get more money. what do they do with it??? they have so much money! how can they not make this game better when they have soooo much money?!!? one last thing, there is also potion making but that only involves grinding the nether for some crap for hours only to get some potion witch you have no use for since the monsters are rly not that hard to kill. this game is pointless if you don\u0027t agree with me feel free to tell me why, i want to hear what you have to say. sorry for the typos.… ",

I enjoyed the days where minecraft was a game where you were not forced to eat almost all the time. Now they are making it more \"realistic\", which I can see makes the game more challenging. Realism also attracts more people to play the game. I am really tongue tied on this one, and I really don\u0027t have a clue what I want to say about this game anymore. It went from being excellent, to now it\u0027s starting to get boring.

Though it was completely simplistic, I could see the potential of a full working game built around the principle. I went ahead and bought the full game, and I think it is one of the best value-for-money games out there. Before I talk about the gameplay, I want to talk about the way it is handled by its designer(s). First up, they constantly update the game for free - you make one payment for the game, and then you own it, and you can download subsequent updates without paying! Not just fixing errors and glitches, but adding entirely new things to do in the game. There is no subscription cost, so they appear to be doing it out of love for the game, more than anything else. Second, they listen to feedback from fans, and even incorporate elements that have been created by fans, if they realise they are good enough to be added to the official version. On top of this, the director has said that if you don\u0027t feel that Minecraft is worth the money, just pirate it, and if you decide later that it\u0027s worth the money, then you can choose to pay if you want. You don\u0027t hear that very often these days. So I love the attitude. Of course, you can have a nice bunch of guys make a game, but who gives a **** if the game plays like a bag of balls? Luckily that is not the case. You start the game up and you can choose either Survival Mode (which is the kind of \"standard\" mode), or you can choose Creative Mode, which gives you access to everything in the game, like a God Mode, and you can also fly around and do whatever you want. In Survival Mode, you begin with nothing at all, and you spawn on a land mass in the wilderness. First thing you notice is that the game generates the landscape as you move through it (though once it is generated, it is permanent). This means that your game experience will be unique to everyone else\u0027s - and if you start a new game, it will be different to your first game. You can choose to play Minecraft however you want to. But I advise going to http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Recipes to get an understand of how to make things to help you. Once you\u0027ve checked out that list, you will want to dive in and start making things. Most likely you will begin with a wooden pick axe, so that you can mine a bit of stone, so you can make stone tools. Stronger material makes better tools, which mine quicker, and last longer before breaking, as well as being able to give you access to more kinds of materials that you can\u0027t mine with an inferior tool. So once you have a stone axe, trees are easy to take down, and you can mine through stone to find coal and iron ore with your stone pick axe. You can also make a stone sword to fend off baddies - such as zombies, giant spiders and exploding monsters. Finding coal is important to start with, to make torches, because it will get dark pretty quick, and as well as not being able to see what you\u0027re doing, baddies will spawn in dark places and kill you fairly swiftly (especially early in the game when you don\u0027t have much to defend yourself with). You should also make yourself a shelter, to hide up and make a treasure chest to save all the goodies you\u0027ve found. It is satisfying to make your first little hideout, whether it\u0027s a wooden hut, a cave you happen to come across, or a hole in the ground leading to a little tunnel. There is a feeling of safety and personality that is not present in other games. You feel like it\u0027s \"yours\", and as you start to furnish it and dig out new rooms, or put flooring down, you turn a hostile world into a pleasant environment. You can make a door or a trapdoor on the entrance to stop enemies just walking in. Also important is making a bed - they act as checkpoints or spawn points, so when you are killed, you will respawn at the last bed you slept in, rather than always having to respawn at the place you spawned at the very beginning of the game. From this point on, your imagination is really your limit. Do you want to explore and see what the land is like, and find all kinds of terrain ranging from snowy mountains, to deserts and swamps? Do you want to go mining and dig into some caves and look for gold, diamonds, ruins, dungeons and treasure? Do you want to hunt enemies, and loot them for their unique items? Do you want to build a castle, or a tree house? Do you want to build traps to catch enemies automatically? Do you want to build a water slide, or a roller coaster? Do you want to make a safe area by making it light up with torches, then build a village or even a city? Do you want to build an underground tunnel system? Do you want to build a railway system? Do you want to build a farm and raise animals? Do you want to grow plants and fruits? Do you want to see how high you can build, or how deep you can dig? It\u0027s basically like a giant playground, a giant wilderness where you can build whatever you want.… ",

Part sandbox game. Part strategy. Part... clicking over and over until your mouse button is worn and your finger hurts. As more Minecraft clones appear, to bank in on the game\u0027s success, we see copy-cat developers actually better certain aspects of the game in their own redesigns. Even now, the developers behind Minecraft seem to be blindly throwing in new ideas hoping to improve the game by adding to the pile of so-so concepts. Minecraft certainly wasn\u0027t the first block-building indie game, and still not the best. But its combination of monsters, mining, and crafting seems to have hooked a hit with the gaming crowd, in a burst of luck and overexposure through social media. Minecraft has its moments of fun, but is a complete bore without multiplayer interaction. The construction system is reasonably lack-luster and the mining system very much feels like a mind-rotting chore than a fun gaming experience. The crafting system redeems the game, barely holding game play together. The visuals, though cute, also feel too basic. Is the pixel style an intentional design, or just a half-baked cover up for cheap 3D graphics? Its too expensive for what it is, and as a sandbox game is reasonably lackluster. Exploration and crafting seem to be the best aspects of Minecraft. Everything in between is a fragile experience.… ",

This is a definite buy for any gamer, as it provides something unique to the open-world RPG/ adventure genre. The sky is the limit! Off the mark, most people will know Minecraft for its unique graphical style. Blocks make up every object in this game, and the simple, yet brilliant art-style ties straight into the core gameplay. Running Minecraft is easy- the requirements are extremely low, and with a good gaming PC, I\u0027ve run this game at well over two-hundred frames per second (that\u0027s fast). However: Minecraft is not brilliantly optimised due to its low budget, so expect some very major slowdown when you crank up the settings. 9/10 In the way of story- there is no definite experience. Your story will be personal to you alone, and nobody\u0027s adventures will be quite the same, although there isn\u0027t a way of tracking what you\u0027ve done so far by means of recording gameplay, a feature which many people would enjoy. 9/10 The game has a very distinct sound design, which delivers around five or six memorable tracks that play at random intervals. An introduction of some new pieces would be nice to hear, though, as the repeating soundtrack can begin to go stale after a while. Sound effects are also good, but their repetitiveness sours the aural experience a fair amount. 7.5/10 But where Minecraft excels the most is in gameplay. When a player first starts their Survival Mode world, they\u0027ll have to chop down trees, craft a crafting table and quickly get to work crafting objects and tools to keep them alive, and safe from the evil enemy \"mobs\" such as exploding Creepers or bow-wielding Skeletons that attack at night. From here on in, the player is left to do basically anything they want, mining underground for better resources with crafted tools, farming plants and animals to eat and pet, and creating almost anything imaginable with blocks. Minecraft is a completely open world, there for players to explore and adore. 10/10 And if the stellar singleplayer wasn\u0027t enough, a multiplayer mode is also available too! This holds the most issues in the game, but will last you even more time. All the servers in Minecraft are private, meaning that you\u0027ll have to look up which games are free, type in the IP address of the server, and only then be able to play games. The process is frustrating, and so is making a server (which is free, but needs downloads and looking up to be able to make one), but it pays off when you finally get a game. There are varying player versus player and co-op gametypes that will keep you and your friends entertained together, and all can be found on the Internet. The addition of voice chat would be welcomed, and it isn\u0027t yet in the game as of the time this review was written, but a chat bar is sufficient enough. Overall, though, Minecraft is a stand-out multiplayer game. 8.5/10 Altogether, Minecraft is a brilliant must-buy for gamers of any age, and really brings something new to the table.

The community is great- if not oddly overenthusiastic at times and should give you a good time. The graphics have never been a problem to me. An 8 for those who are creative and a 6 for those who aren\u0027t, so an average of 7 is pretty good.… ",

As well as this, minecraft\u0027s multiplayer option has made the game ever-more addictive, with easy interaction and chat with other players (which also causes some problems). I personally find multiplayer fun because of the competition offered by many servers; which is greatly improved when the server is modded to have extra abilities and features added to the game, like shops and skills. In short, some people will either love the game, or get bored after about 10 minutes; if you\u0027re really put off by the graphics, either don\u0027t bother getting the game, or get it and improve the graphics with texture packs, which can make the game look quite sophisticated indeed, presuming that your computer can handle it.… ",

I did end up buying Fallout 3 but it didn\u0027t kept me awake at night like it did to some people (still, a great game!). The game that did that for me was Minecraft. The idea of being able to modify the ole world and build everything I could think of was incredible! Even more incredible when the stuff you build actually had a purpose, to help you survive. I really became a fan of survival games when I started to play Minecraft, unfortunately, the survival element of the game disappears after the first 4 or 5 in-game days because, by that time, I\u0027d already built myself a basic house, I had a mine and I had weapons. It turns into sandbox RPG where you just want to raid dungeons, farm XP, get better gear, kill bosses and then kill the Ender Dragon (the final boss). The developers really got me confused when they started putting these RPG-ish things into the game (bosses, leveling system, potions, dungeons, enchantments...) instead of enhancing the survival aspect of Minecraft. That (to me) was a problem. Another problem tis game has is that you will probablly lose interest on the game when you get to the middle part of the game because you\u0027ve become so strong and resourcefull that nothing feels challenging anymore. Lucklly for Minecraft, those are the only mistakes I found in the game. The random map generator is amazing, the creative mode lets you use every block in the game so you can just build awesome stuff hardcore mode adds permadeath, making the game more challenging and the multiplayer makes everything more enjoyable (and there\u0027s LAN). I gave this game a 7 out of 10, not because it\u0027s a good survival game but because it\u0027s a great adventure game that\u0027s even better with friends, because it allows you to shape the world as you want and because of the amazing world generator that give this game a lot of re-playability.

The graphics are good to a game that has infinite possibilities in an infinite world (anyways, you can install LOTS of texture and graphic mods). The sound is nice too.

It\u0027s like a LEGO infinite world and infinite odds, hell I think this game is infinite in all ways. There are a lot of free updates and improvements every month, that make the game bigger and bigger. I have to say that the best way to play this game is installing mods or/and playing multiplayer with friends, if you play singleplayer without an idea you could get little bit disappointed, because it\u0027s simple to play, but difficult to learn (this game has a lot of things). But if you give to this game an opportunity, and you play with friends/mods, it\u0027s a Masterpiece. Sorry for my english. Download this game, and if you like it you can buy the game, but it\u0027s not 100% necessary (I bought it because I wanted to contribute the developers).… ",

What to say about Minecraft...its...interesting While certainly not a technical marvel, or a ground breaking, blockbuster, Minecraft is certainly omnipresent with modern gamers. Most like a \"sandbox\" mode from some games, Minecraft lets you break and place blocks, build a shelter, explore and mine. But not just that, you can build anything you want, nobody telling you what to do, or a block limit, just pure simple creativity. With Its 8-Bit graphics and music, Minecraft is like no other game ever created. However, it\u0027s whole idea gets boring after you defeat the final boss, the Ender Dragon. You\u0027ve explore all the caves, mined all the ores, brewed all the potions, and now you just defeated a goddamn dragon. It gets old after that, unless you find a server you like, or install one of the vast majorities of mods. Its also overpriced for what it is, $30 dollars seems a litte steep for this, but its still a great buy. Be warned about Multiplayer though, greifers and spammers still exist on the plains of Minecraftia. Overall, I would buy It if you want a nice, little indie title to play for a while.… ",

Gameplay: Gameplay is the essence of MineCraft, without MineCraft’s signature gameplay, it would be nothing. MineCraft’s gameplay is original and interesting in almost every way. The point of MineCraft is to survive in an infinite world that is peaceful and serene by day, and hostile and evil by night. A player starts by beating down trees with their bare hands in order to start their way towards building their first shelter to survive their first Zombie, Skeleton, and Creeper filled night. From this point on there is almost no structure to MineCraft, you can do what YOU want, set YOUR own goals, do you want to upgrade your tools to the next tier, add that nice new expansion to your house that you wanted, or start brewing potions to take on one of the game’s two bosses. But once you have built the ultimate house, filled your inventory with diamond tools and armor, defeated every boss and pillaged every dungeon, the game is not over. Once you feel as though the standard MineCraft formula is getting a little slow, you can go online to get mods that continue to change and revolutionize the game. From simple additions that add more enemies to the game, or a mod that changes the game almost completely. MineCraft’s gameplay is truly never ending so long as it’s community continues to support it. Music/Sounds: MineCraft’s music and sound are so in line, so perfectly fitting to the situation that they appear in, C418 has set the mood to MineCraft perfectly. With Subwoofer Lullaby playing in the background as you peruse the landscapes, or hearing Dry Hands as you carefully lurk throughout a cave, the song capitalizing on your fear that something might be following you. The soundtrack truly makes itself at home in this game, and I couldn’t imagine any music fitting better. Graphics: These don’t really matter, but they are something to talk about. The graphics in this game are not meant to look modern or beautiful. Whether it was for style or for the ease of making a building system, the fact that everything is made of cubes or rectangular prisms really gives the game feeling. You wouldn’t think so, but sometimes you can see some pretty beautiful vistas as you explore throughout this game. The retro feeling low resolution textures really give the game a retro type feeling, while the game still uses modern day gaming conventions. Technological: Technologically, MineCraft is not too advanced, but it is nothing to be trifled. MineCraft is well optimized so it can be run on non high-end computers to keep the audience wider. Although MineCraft is nothing special from a technological standpoint, it still makes up for this in the same way retro games did, by having great music and gameplay. Verdict: MineCraft is a very good game, placing as the sixth most sold PC game of all time, with good reason. The way it has the retro feeling graphics, the modern day gaming conventions, the pure creativity that allows for seemingly anything to be created, the modern soundtrack that fits in with the game like two parts of a jigsaw puzzle, and the fact that the game’s fanbase has been able to watch the game blossom and grow since the alpha. MineCraft truly is a one of a kind game, except for the 4 or 6 games that seem all too inspired by it. Overall, 9/10… ",

Music discs offer good alternatives and all of the songs appealed to me. But you can mute the music, problem solved. Combat, although just a small part of the game, is just click the right mouse button until the thing dies. However combat isn\u0027t a focus, whereas exploration, creation, and imagination are rewarded and focused on.

The graphics aren\u0027t that good, but it doesn\u0027t matter, yet for the idiots who think it does you can use Texture Packs to make it look different, which is great. Minecraft, yes, takes time to learn and get used to, but afterwards its a fun and challenging game. With Achievements, you don\u0027t feel pressured to get them as they\u0027re optional and don\u0027t affect anything. There IS a way to finish the game, by locating a Stronghold with Ender Eyes and jumping through the portal to defeat the Dragon. It can be done whenever you want as Minecraft is a Sandbox game and if you do try then it will take a good while, but not too long. Gameplay is fun. There are three modes, Survival, Creative and Hardcore. Survival is a survival mode, hunt for food, fight monsters, etc. In Creative you have god power and can do whatever. In Hardcore, it is like Survival but locked on Hard and you can only die once. The game is cheap for what it is so go buy it. My only complaint is it may lag, but that\u0027s it.… ",

Back then, it\u0027s freedom, pixelated beauty, and atmosphere of mystery and exploration drew me like a magnet. It was a beacon a lighthouse illuminating the horrid state of the games I was playing. I bought the game almost immediately after and right away fell in love. As I was then a newcomer, the community welcomed me. More so than any mainstream multiplier-capable game I\u0027ve ever played. Instead of rejecting me, treating me like something to be laughed at, I was assisted by other players. Minecraft drew my attention to other great indie games. Far better that the mainstream shooters could ever hope to be. I looked back on the games I had once played with scorn and (mainly) regret. I\u0027ve found games in the Indie community that can out match any game run by a large company. Some of these games include Kerbal Space Program, Ace Of Spades Classic, Terraria, and much more. I see minecraft as not only a game, but the prominent and most well-known game among the indie game community. I\u0027m sick and tired of on-rail games. They\u0027re a thing of the past. Steam has the greenlight service for a reason. I\u0027m among the group of gamers who are tired of games in which the only people that have freedom are the creators, and in which the players are penalized for not adhering to the game\u0027s brutal story line of the game. And what if I don\u0027t want to fight in an endless and arbitrary war? On-rail games often depict an extraordinary world, yet confine the players to a battlefield often no bigger than that of an airport- and those are the biggest maps I\u0027ve seen. They offer no degree of freedom, individuality, or creativeness. Minecraft and some other games I\u0027ve seen in the indie community can often, in my opinion, be classified as art. That is much much more than could be said about some shooters. And when you hate and just can\u0027t stand minecraft\u0027s pixelated textures, get or make a texture pack. If you get bored of the game play, install a mod or make your own. Minecraft, after all, is only limited by your imagination.… ",

There is a nice day/night cycle, randomly generated terrain with hidden dungeons, underground cave systems, huge oceans, hills, swamps, villages, and with lots of other biomes and areas. In normal survival mode, you start basically with nothing. You need to collect resources, craft tools, clothing, hunt, and explore new areas and visit other worlds. There is an ending for the game, so it is not just for nothing. Redstone is an other really cool feature, you can build traps, complex machines with it. It is a really nice, unique feature of the game. Also there is an unlimited creative mode, where you can build and create without limitations. You can generate normal and flat world in case you want to build on a flat area. As much the game is, there are large amount of flaws in it. One of the frustrating factor is it is still very badly optimised. It lags sometimes like hell, You should say, get a better PC, but to be honest, I saw better looking and well working similar programs, that ran much better and had nice, high resolution textures. So the code is unoptimised, and also buggy. With all the updates we get some new content also lots of new glitches. That\u0027s sad. There are still not enough mobs (creatures) in the game. My other problem is the sounds. The game lacks of nice environmental sound effects. I would be happy with cricket sounds at night, birds tweeting, and other nice environmental sound effects. Multiplayer is much more enjoyable than any modes of single player. Unfortunately, it can be also glitchy sometimes. Don\u0027t think about major glitches, but they\u0027re still there. Also there is no server browser, which would be a nice feature. In multiplayer, there are much more possibilities, also there are non-official servers programs that gives great expansion for the game as permissions, better tools for editing the world, add shops into the game, make PVP arenas, etc... Good news, there are lots of modders and there lots of mods out there, however, modding is not supported by Mojang (the creators of the game). Some mod APIs are already done by modders, gives possibility to play with mods in both single and multiplayer! For 1.6 there is a Modding API in plan, that will give official support for mods. I can\u0027t wait for that! So in overall, Minecraft is a unique experience, if you can live with the graphical limitations, but I still feel the game unpolished and unfinished. If I was reviewing 1.0 (or 1.7.3 Beta, which was my favorite), maybe I would give it a higher score, but I think the game is going slight downhill, the updates are not really large progresses at all, they doesn\u0027t really fix some basic problems, the optimization is bad, and it has some basic issues.… ",

A friend of mine had a friend that is a girl that created a picture of Albert Einstein. Yeah I\u0027m serious. Make your own server, get mods, get it known all overthe world and have FUN! Worth every penny.… ",

Maybe you want to create flying dragons for Skyrim, or just new music? There\u0027re a ton of moddable games out there people want to play in, but not necessarily create for, and it\u0027s generally pretty simple to mod games, even when script editors are involved. Particularly for Blizz games (and I haven\u0027t touched SC2 modding due to Activision/Blizz rules, on top of their DRM), the modding tools are powerful enough to allow you to create whatever kind of game you want, faster, simpler, prettier, and just more fun than possible to do in modding MC. For music, use something like Fruitloops why limit yourself to the extremely simple, and unwieldy tools in Minecraft? To that extent, I just don\u0027t get it and as a game alone, Minecraft just doesn\u0027t have much content. If I thought there were going to be massive monthly updates like we see in games like Don\u0027t Starve, I\u0027d stick around but Minecraft\u0027s just too barren this late in. It was all hype, and it showed a ton of promise (mostly because it was actually being developed), and then.... it pretty much stayed the same. It\u0027s difficult to really score this, though. Objectively, especially. I mean even though the base game is more-or-less unsupported at this point, the modders are still going full-steam and dramatically increasing the usability, flexibility, and enjoy-ability of the game. It\u0027s just a bad game (which was very promising) without good tools to help the modders out. So... I give the base-game alone 2/10, but 4/10 considering the current mods.… ",

You can play with Lego figures and make them fight. That doesn\u0027t make Lego a game. It\u0027s a toybox/sandbox, and really nothing else. The gameplay is repetitive and gets boring after a while. Fallacy number 2: Updates. Minecraft\u0027s updates used to add new things that build onto the gameplay, not worthless things like more biomes and potions. Minecraft no longer progresses. Fallacy number 3 (the BIG one): Community. Minecraft\u0027s community sucks, plain and simple. It\u0027s full of moronic fanboys who bought the game because it\u0027s popular.

The real potential of the game has been ignored and rpg like features has been added to make it more commercial and appealing to the casual gamer. And the bugs. The game is just full of them and every release adds more than it solves. This is a real pity, but it almost looks like the devs doesn\u0027t even care about it anymore, Minecraft maked them rich, why should they bother?

The game was not complete when released. It had little content and looked horrid compared to what it use to look like. Now we get rare updates that add more adventure qualities to a CREATIVE game! Look at the new update for example it added horses and that\u0027s about it and how long did it take them like an entire 2 months. This game is a sorry excuse for a game and I wish to see it burn!

The number of Minecraft-inspired, voxel-based sandbox clones is all the more impressive if you take into account how the original game came out of nowhere. However, despite its dominating position, one could definitely see how another game might be able to do what Minecraft does but better. This is because Minecraft simply hasn\u0027t improved significantly since its early Beta stages. Although the continuous development process is a good thing in and of itself, the quality of the updates to the game thereby churned out is inconsistent at best. While detours into the lackadaisical might have been more understandable when Notch- the game\u0027s original creator- was solely responsible for development, the game continues to receive updates that seem directionless and poorly conceived. At best new features seem random and disconnected from the rest of the game, and at worst they amount to little more than introducing simplified versions of popular community mods into the vanilla game. I suspect that Mojang is simply too afraid to tinker with even the minor details of the core experience as it existed from the game\u0027s beginning, and thus they believe that piling more underdeveloped content on is the way to ensure the game\u0027s longevity. The result is a fun game that hasn\u0027t reached its full potential and that probably won\u0027t do so until Mojang ventures to introduce some complexity into the game\u0027s core systems, instead of relying on the emergent depth of gameplay that Notch fortunately happened upon.… ",

It opens doors that other games feared to open, fearing bad publicity. It sucks you in and won\u0027t let you out until With all this, however, the game is not perfect. Lighting errors. Shifty boat/mine cart travel. Lag. Exploits. Filler achievements. (Open inventory. Really? A four-year-old can press the E button). These things can take you out of this gorgeous world and into a mediocre one. Also, certain aspects of the game are hard to grasp by simpler players who also want to explore and create. Not many gamers will \"get\" how to make some of the game\u0027s items or blocks. And don\u0027t even get me started on redstone wiring... However, I am nitpicking by pointing out the lows of this game; it\u0027s very awesome (and I don\u0027t just mean \"cool\", I mean \"it puts me in awe\"). There\u0027s literally no end to this game. It does not tell you what you need to do; rather, YOU tell IT what to do. You can change the world, man! If you think that a mountain is in your way, you can blow it to kingdom come with your TNT! If you decide that your house just isn\u0027t big enough, you can expand it in any direction! You can literally go to Hell and back! You can RIDE PIGS! You can build the stairway to heaven! You can go as far as you want! THERE IS NO END TO MINECRAFT!… ",

Some claim Minecraft is a bad game, because there is not a lot to do in vanilla survival. I do admit, that it does get boring. But the point of Minecraft is not just to play vanilla survival. The point of Minecraft is to try mods, custom maps and servers. The speciality about Minecraft is that more stuff gets added every few months. Of course you might claim that a lot of games add new purchasable content every month, but Minecraft gives every update for free. Those, who claimed that Minecraft is bad in 1.0 (the official \"Release\"), should try again. Minecraft is never going to be actually \"Ready\", as more bug fixes and features keep getting added all the time! Some claim the ending sucks. The ending of Minecraft is not the main point. It\u0027s just a tiny little part of the game.… ",

We made some nice stuffs n\u0027 that, but it got quite boring quite fast, and i decided to give the full game a shot. I just really loved the unlimited possibilities in the game, and today it\u0027s probably my most played game with approximately 1.000 hours played, if not more. Another thing i really love is that when im out of ideas and the game starts to get boring, then i\u0027ve most likely been able to take a break from Minecraft (a few months) to get new ideas and so on. When i get new ideas it\u0027s like playing a whole new game every time because of all these possibilities. Some people also complain about the graphics considering it\u0027s a game from 2011, but to me it just makes the game truly unique, and i also think that was what Notch wanted to obtain with this kind of graphics. All in all i really love this game, and after so many hours of fun, i feel like the least i can do is to give this game a 10 of 10! PS: I would not recommend to judge this game, if you\u0027ve only played the free version, go buy the full game and try it instead. It\u0027s so much better!… ",

I don\u0027t like some of the changes Mojang has made to Minecraft, but I would honestly say the good slightly outweighs the bad.

Then again, it\u0027s come a long way and tons of friendly people, mods, and texture packs live in the Minecraft wild, and it is indeed fun to play with sometimes. In short: Minecraft\u0027s good concept is very slightly ruined by updates that kinda ruin the game\u0027s aspect and eventual non-appeal. For 26 bucks? I\u0027d say it\u0027s worth it.

Exploring is fun at first, as is mining minerals and getting better gear, but this quickly becomes repetitive because there is not as much to find. Building grand structures and complex mechanisms (the highlight of the game) is not much fun in a world where you are the only one to appreciate it. Combat is another big weakness. There are essentially only two ways to attack enemies: melee attacks and bows. All weapons in the game have the same \"attacks\" so combat is the same formula throughout the game, you just don\u0027t have many options. This all might have been tolerable if the game had a pleasant atmosphere, but with graphics that I personally don\u0027t think look good, and a lack of good music, the game is not fun to spend time in.

Apparently the java is a devil to code with b/c each update requires mod overhauls; the mod websites are plagued with malicious coding to lure people to install browser hi-jacking software. How is this relevant you ask? Steam has a wonderful mod installation/update method, so at this phase in the games history, a Mahjong approval system is really a must, b/c this game can keep the entertainment flowing with a little more flavor in the vanilla.… ",

I will talk about Minecraft, a pixelated, blocky, survival themed sandbox RPG that consists of creation and destruction. I am going to start of with the graphics. I know it may look dated and pixelated, though the sheer idea is in a way, genius. No one ever thinks to make a pixelated 3D game, for one. There is like a line of separation between pixelated 2D and polygonal 3D. This makes it memorable. Secondly, it reduces lag. You claim it\u0027s a buggy mess. I tell you it\u0027s really not that bad. The bugs that are there are minor and being fixed by constant updates. You may think it was because they were indie developers and so they couldn\u0027t, or they were too lazy, but I tell you it wouldn\u0027t of been too hard to make it super polished. Still, you can choose whether you want to love it or ate it. You can add texture packs if you really dislike it, though you\u0027d need a super computer for some of the better high-res ones. Now, about the world. It\u0027s fully destructible. It\u0027s made of cubes. The former is the cause of the latter, because these were indie developers. I\u0027m not saying they couldn\u0027t of, but they didn\u0027t. It definitely works, and makes exploration workable. They don\u0027t have Assassin\u0027s Creed type character movement, but the destructibility makes it workable. It means there is a type of strategy to what you do, and let\u0027s you get creative. The creation is good for the most part, but since it\u0027s made out of cubes, and they all have to exist on this 3D grid, it definitely creates spatial problems. For example, making a car like object is impossible, even though you can use minecarts, which needs to have rails placed before hand. In the end, it\u0027s still brilliant. You can create and destroy in Minecraft, as well as create functional things with redstone, Minecraft\u0027s electronics equivalent. This makes Minecraft the most creative game ever made, while letting you use strategy. Minecraft has no story. You make your own goals, but there are challenging areas and enemies that have been implemented to help you make them. Singleplayer is fun and will keep you hooked, but multiplayer is just great. You will have some trouble setting a server up if you want to play with friends, but after the setting up, it\u0027s fairly easy to start it again. You can create traps in Minecraft, and it\u0027s good in singleplayer to fight enemies (that need better AI, although being worked on), but it\u0027s best when you use it in multiplayer.… ",

The building is easy and looks good. You can add mods to change parts of the game. Modding is very easy to do. Multiplayer keeps you playing for a long time. Generally, most of the mobs are somewhat difficult. It also allows for many different ways to play such as adventure maps, multiplayer custom gamemodes, and more. Anyone starting this game would certainly enjoy it, and for a long time. But let\u0027s get to the bad. Why this game is also pretty bad. First off, gameplay. When I am at the diamond age, what is there to do? Sure there is building, but making buildings gets boring after some time, and really doesn\u0027t do much. Sure there are bosses, such as the Ender Dragon (Boring: Swoops down every 5 minutes, and has the knockback of the devil) and the Wither (interesting, but the beacons just make the game more boring and easy: Pretty difficult to kill, gathering the materials needed to make the wither can be extremely annoying and boring), but the ender dragon barely gives you anything that is needed, and the Wither drops a star to make the beacon which makes a easy game even easier. Sure there is multiplayer, but seriously, it does get boring after a long time (Like all games do when you overplay them). Sure there are mods, but that isn\u0027t part of the game, and most make the game even easier. Sure there are new updates, which aren\u0027t very interesting, and add mostly annoying things to the game, and the developers aren\u0027t so nice/good. Take Jeb for example which says \"If you don\u0027t like the game, then don\u0027t play it.\" Why is that bad to say? Because that means he doesn\u0027t care, and wants money since he already knows you bought the game. Then he takes bad community output from players who don\u0027t care for gameplay and want a game that is easy. I\u0027m not even going to get into recent updates. Disgusting. Overall, I enjoyed the game a lot, and it started a new style for gaming and graphics.… ",

Open-ended play with the option to change difficulty if you get bored or run into a tight spot with mobs (though I am to understand those players steeped in the world of little pixels find switching to \"peaceful\" mode an abomination ) -It\u0027s great for kids and adults alike, offering endless gameplay and nearly endless adventure. -Updates are usually always improving the game, or fixing bugs and providing new tidbits or items to find -Controls are simple on the PC and once you learn it\u0027s pretty hard to forget it. -You can alter how the game looks, the rendering distance, and most of the usual basic controls of a game. -Lots of help can be found on the Minecraftwiki site, among other places, if you find yourself confused about how to craft something or what you should be aiming for next. -You can leave this game for a month or for a day, and when you start up again, it\u0027s right where you left off and you can usually pick up where you left off. Cons: -There are so many things to do and see, people who are more action-oriented will be disappointed until you can get to the Nether, or face one of the two end bosses\u0027 that I\u0027m aware of. -Diamond seems, at times, very very hard to find, as it should be; but players might get discouraged after days of spelunking only to come back with a chests\u0027 worth of cobblestone. -Unless you have a speedy computer, the game can get a little glitchy and slow. The good thing is that there are different rendering options. -This can be a time-sink, and at the end of a day\u0027s worth of play, you realize you have done nothing in the sometimes less interactive real world. Set a timer or a goal if you\u0027re a person who easily falls into hours of gameplay and you have other things to do! Overall: I love this game, and games like this that are open world. That said, a couple more milestones or achievements to point lost players in the right direction might be helpful to some of the younger players who want to \"beat\" the game.… ",

That was just the singleplayer the multiplayer servers add even more, with custom plugins and game modes such as survival games or just mining and building with friends the multilplayer greatly increases the playtime. There is much more to add such as the enormous amount if mobs neutral and hostile and the immersive day to night cycle which really fits in with the game. The only problem with this it was quite hard and still is to set up a server for your friends to play on but that has gotten allot easier.

It is one of the most addictive, rewarding experiences you will ever play. If you haven\u0027t play Minecraft, what the hell are you waiting for? And trust me, the PC version is the one you want. First, almost every computer in the world runs it, you don\u0027t need a megalodon with high-tech specs to run the game. Second, don\u0027t **** about graphics. Minecraft is a beautiful game. It\u0027s blocky art stile is charming, and seeing a sunset for the first time with the eclectic piano music behind is just mesmerizingly beautiful. The objective in Minecraft is to survive. Or at least it is in \"Survival\" mode. As you progress through the game, you will progress in things like building a house, hunting monsters or going to hell. Everything can be for nothing in a blink of an eye (When you are dead, YOU ARE dead). You must orientate yourself in the random generated world, find shelter and food, and protect yourself from the creatures of the night. At moments it is thrilling, at moments scary, at moments funny. You never know what is going to happen in a typical Minecraft day. Then you have \"Creative\" mode. In this mode, you can do whatever you want with the blocks you want. Build a giant diamond mansion, and why not shape it like a yatch? How about farming zombies? The limit is literally your imagination. Minecraft also offers a multiplayer service. You can either play with friends or join a server to play something with the community. Want to play Hunger Games, Block Hunt and many other games with people from all around the world? Then the multiplayer experience is perfect for you. The variety of things to do and see is amazing. Minecraft is easily one of the jewels of this generation and of gaming history. It isn\u0027t ambitious and still, it feels like the biggest-scaled game ever made. It is always updating, expanding to keep things fresh, and it truly is the Indie Game that revolutionized the industry.… ",

But for being able to play any genre there has got to be some disadvantage right? Yes, ofHaving played this game since it\u0027s alpha stages, I can tell you they have done a good job of updating and keeping the game a little different. The possibilities are pretty much endless; you can play any genre you want on this. Of course, unless you download a texture pack, it all looks the same. But for being able to play any genre there has got to be some disadvantage right? Yes, of course there is. If in survival, you must collect and build, but in creative you just have to build. So if you want a puzzle game, you have to make. And if you want a fighting arena you have to make it. Luckily there are multiplayer servers that you can play on that build all these things for you to play at. Another cool thing about minecraft is it\u0027s ability to mod it so easily. The game was designed to provide ample entertainment without mods, but with them you can get anything you want out of this game. As some have said, you don\u0027t really have a goal, as you are stranded in the middle of no where. But at first, there are goals. Build a house, collect materials, craft cool items, etc. Also, achievements get you something to work for. Also, the Ender Dragon is most peoples ultimate goal, and it takes a very long time to get to have a chance against it. Afterwards though, they leave it up to you to decide what happens next. Luckily with rather frequent updates you can explore new areas and meet new creatures. So if you like a very very unrestricted game, Minecraft is the way to go.And for only around 30 dollars, you can\u0027t really go wrong. For a sandbox game, Minecraft is the top choice.… ",

While initially lacking some features that could have made the game more enjoyable; the majority of those features have now been added. The chief complaint from those that have clearly not played the game is that the graphics are terrible and that reason alone is enough to avoid the game. If you ever actually play the game you realize that the block design was by choice as well as for convenience and in no way affects the way you play the game. Everything is designed to fit with the blocks, the enemies, the tools, even the watermelons are square! Although I have moved on to the Feed the Beast pack due to the shear amount to do it in; Minecraft is definitely worth your time.… ",

Discussing Minecraft in a negative manner is extremely dangerous thanks to the amount of drooling drones that will defend this game to their last breath. Hmm... Well, let\u0027s break this review up into multiple categories. 1. Graphics This is a very subjective and sensitive topic to elaborate on. It all comesAh, good old Minecraft... I honestly don\u0027t know where to start with this one. Discussing Minecraft in a negative manner is extremely dangerous thanks to the amount of drooling drones that will defend this game to their last breath. Hmm... Well, let\u0027s break this review up into multiple categories. 1. Graphics This is a very subjective and sensitive topic to elaborate on. It all comes down to your personal opinion. Some people like Minecraft\u0027s \u0027retro\u0027 graphical style, and some people say it\u0027s disgusting. But games aren\u0027t all about the graphics, right? Well, maybe for some people... Don\u0027t worry though, the vast modding community surrounding the game has come up with many fantastic texture mods to suit your needs. Hell, you can even make a texture mod yourself if you wanted to. Personally, I think the original textures look bland and boring, but I digress... 2. Sound The sound design for Minecraft is nothing short of a masterpiece. Whether smashing a block, or listening to the game\u0027s soundtrack, you\u0027ll instantly be satisfied. I haven\u0027t found one person that doesn\u0027t like Minecraft\u0027s vast soundtrack. It has a calm and soothing tone to it. Sometimes you\u0027ll hear creepy cave wind sounds when mining, or hear running water when near a stream. It\u0027s definitely one of the better things about Minecraft. There are many different sounds modifications as well. 3. Gameplay Minecraft\u0027s simplistic nature is what makes it so easy to pick up and play. Well, when you learn the different crafting recipes of course. But this fact is also it\u0027s greatest downfall... After you\u0027ve conquered every dungeon and cave, found every mineral and treasure, and built your own little town, there\u0027s not much left to do. The game has no plot or purpose, it\u0027s just kind of there for you to paint your own world on the canvas of your own choosing. I\u0027m simply saying after doing this same process over and over, it starts to grow on you. It becomes less and less exciting for every diamond or rare goodie you find. Don\u0027t worry though, there\u0027s tons of mods to keep you interested, right? Eh, most of the mods are focused on making the game even easier than it already is so... it\u0027s a mixed bag. It all comes back to your own opinion. 4. Community This goes without saying... Minecraft\u0027s community is horrible. Lemme give you some insight on what kinds of \u0027people\u0027 I\u0027ve come across. A. Extremely immature children that think they know everything and anything about the world. B. Teenagers that have no life outside of coming home from school and sitting on their computer. C. Adults in their 30s and 40s that haven\u0027t quite grown up yet. D.(EXTREMELY RARE) All around good people that respect fellow players and the game itself. So yeah, another mixed bag... Eh, this topic is pretty pointless. It\u0027ll only serve to get more mindless drones to thumb down this review because they can\u0027t accept the truth. Conclusion... All in all, this game is not horrendously bad... It has it\u0027s flaws, but let\u0027s be honest... The only thing that has kept this game afloat in recent years is the vast modding community that adds new content regularly. The original developers, Mojang, have become greedy and lazy, and are just letting the community do their work for them. The only thing they seem to add to the game are more bugs and glitches. I am appalled at the childish behavior by the main developers on social media sites... But the matter of the fact is, money changes people. It makes them evil. That\u0027s a fact we can all agree on... Thanks for reading guys. I appreciate you taking time out of your day for my review. To all the mindless drones, go ahead and thumb this down into oblivion. I really don\u0027t care. -Starkiller94… ",

Anyone who would play Minecraft would know that its a game of a 1000 games. Anyone can play it young or old. There are plenty of servers. Many blocks and mods to keep you building. Also Minecraft has survival to survive the night and defeat the wither and the EnderDragon. It has to be the indie game that changed the gaming industry for a long time. The mechanics arent much, but its easy to learn. If you don\u0027t like the small blocky graphics there are resource packs that change the sounds and textures. It can go from around 3x3 per block/item, to 5012x5012! Its a great game to keep your kids away from shooting and violent games. Its very cheap and you dont need much to play the game. It runs on Mac, Windows, Linux. You need at least 2gbs of RAM and around a few MegaBytes of space. I highly recomend the game, its fun to bring friends and family closer. :)… ",

It resides as one of my absolute favorite hobbies as I use it for a creative outlet.(Yes, a hobby, as playing it feels more like a past-time than an actual \"video game\") The amount of potential that this game holds is beyond belief. It is not without it\u0027s faults, unfortunately, which keeps me from giving this wonderful game a perfect 10. I will also admit that Minecraft is not for everyone. I see a lot of contradicting reviews, and feel that it is best for me to be perfectly honest about the game. Pros *If you like sandbox games, this one is certainly worth a try. The limit is the sky. With each and every inch of the land at your disposal. The whole world is your play pen. Ive seen people create things from mighty fortresses of doom to beautiful cities to quirky pixel art. *If you like survival and exploration games, you might want to give this one a try. From spelunking for resources and raising livestock to exploration and fending off undead, the game does well in immersing the player in its 3d environment. *Multiplayer! I feel that this game is best experienced with others, wither you are working on a group creative project or exploring that dark and creepy cavern. I feel that Minecraft has a very personal feel to it, so what is better than being able to adventure with your friends or show off your greatest creations? *Minecraft has a vast modding community. If you feel that certain types of content in minecraft is lacking for your tastes, then you can probably remedy that with your choice from thousands of different mods created by the player base. *Visuals and sound. The landscape and biome generation can make for some absolutely stunning visuals. The music and dynamic sounds significantly add to the games wonderful immersion. Cons *First and foremost, Minecraft is created in Java. The engine is heavy, and very clunky. The game can take it\u0027s toll on even some of the best systems. Getting your fps higher than 60 can be nearly impossible without having a beast of a computer, which seems quite unnecessary for a game of this type.(Although performance does seem to have improved since the last major overhaul patch) It also tends to have its share of icky bugs. *There is absolutely no story, what-so-ever. If you are looking for a thrilling plot, then minecraft may not be for you. *survival will start to get a bit dull after a while if you aren\u0027t playing with mods or others. *A good portion of its online community is made up of children, and as such you will run into a lot of immature players who feel no remorse for destroying your progress. It takes quite a bit of effort to find trustworthy players online. *Progress in the game\u0027s development is there, but extremely slow. *Minecraft\u0027s default textures and graphics are very low res and blocky. While some may feel that it adds on to the game\u0027s individual style, others may not be to happy about it. (note that the textures can in fact be changed, as many players in the community have created some really stunning and interesting texture packs of all resolutions.)… ",

I remember hearing about it online and looking at what you can do in this game and when I finally got the game I was not disappointed a bit! I love the gameplay in this game both in survival and creative mode. I love survival because it gives me that feeling of exploration of going to build and craft things, fight monsters, go mining and when you complete hard tasks it can feel very rewarding. I also love creative mode because it\u0027s the opportunity to go around a create things that are huge and beautiful with almost no limitations; some things in creative do take a long time to make but when I am done they are very rewarding as well. I also love the music in this game and some of the atmospheres; however I will warn you that there are some really creepy things in this game. Overall, Minecraft is a masterpiece! I really wish people wouldn\u0027t bash this game just because they may call it too \"mainstream\" or something like that. The game is great, It also great to come back to this game after not playing it for a while. Trust me, I started playing this game back in 2012 and I am still playing it a lot today in 2014.… ",

From the ALPHA phase, Minecraft was still nothing. But in the BETAMinecraft is by far one of the greatest indie game ever invented. And I sure gives the inventor (Markus \"Notch\" Persson) a hell of a point. This voxel based sandbox game that is really fun to play. It increased people\u0027s creativity to create, explore, and other things you can imagine surviving with a more intense world. From the ALPHA phase, Minecraft was still nothing. But in the BETA phase, it already broke some records. First record, it was awarded the most popular game in BETA. The next record, shows that this game is the best sandbox game yet. Exploring the unlimited possibilities in the endless world of cubes. Crafting, Surviving, and Thriving. Making huge creations and make differences in this world. They also update the game eventually sometimes in 2 months time. And by my very critic, this game deserves a wonderful score of 10. Some people may say that this game is a waste of time. Well, it\u0027s actually a very great game to KILL some time. Some of the users/players of this game says that it lacked of gaming and it\u0027s made out of pixel. Some say it\u0027s the worst. The game is actually pixelated, but it\u0027s actually pixelated using cubes and blocks. That\u0027s why it seems so 3D. You can create endless creations and everything you want. But my surprise of this game it the multiplayer feature. It is really fun and enjoyable playing beyond the community and have fun by playing minigames. Or just doing a survival together with your friends. A 3D sandbox with a multiplayer feature? That\u0027s really fun for players that doesn\u0027t like being alone. I picked the three best servers so far, and the three of them keep amaze me anytime I go there. The best server so far is Mineplex by my opinion. The second is the Hypixel Network. And the third is The Hive. I really don\u0027t judge these servers because they are all good-to-play servers and all that, but in those critic, I\u0027ll judge them because this IS a critic. Apart from all of that, this is a wonderful game. I honored the creators of this game, which is TeamMojang, and I appreciate this kind of games. Indulging and exciting.… ",

I am ANGRY at all you negative reviewers out there, you overlook the influence on culture these days of Minecraft, comparing it to other games (BTW I am looking for the perfect game which you will find my Qualifications in the Profile) This has by far been the Crown Jewel of My PC games, It is near my perfect game standard and it is the closest one there. Also about it\u0027s influence on culture, this game has truly defined the true basic principle of open-ended games, I believe it even has created it\u0027s own genre. And other than that I believe you negative reviewers never even tried to venture within the game itself, you didn\u0027t even bother to look at the wiki, it may be buggy however it \u0027s Success overshadows it\u0027s flaws. And by the way did you even care to look at modding this game? This game for me, has an almost infinite number of mods out there, so the game is extremely flexible. And by the way have you seen Terraria? If you like the game and you review this negatively, then you know what? Terraria was inspired By MINECRAFT. So in my view this game belongs with the great historic games, which have forever changed the world, and if you ask me, Minecraft has begun it\u0027s own gaming generation CONVERSATION OVER, PERIOD.… ",

I guess it\u0027s an insult to all other games to say that minecraft is the best game ever - However, I thinkMinecraft is indeed a good game, but I would not say a masterpiece. In my opinion, it come as a light in a bad age of games, it came right when those repetitive first-peron shooters were dominating the market. Minecraft emerged as an alternative to those who don\u0027t like these games. I guess it\u0027s an insult to all other games to say that minecraft is the best game ever - However, I think it\u0027s the most striking game from the present. Well, to explain these paragraphs I will make a list of the bad/good points from Minecraft: GOOD POINTS - Creative game with thousands of possibilities; - Different and unique graphics; - Classic music which fits in the game; - A very good platform to mod and make plugins for; - Runs on any PC (on lowest settings); - A quite good multiplayer; - Hollow (and sometimes dark) atmosphere; - Several large and mysterious worlds to explore. BAD POINTS - Poorly coded, with much lag; - Poorly detailed graphics (the game couldn\u0027t improve them a bit more without losing its style); - Bad sound effects; - Many non-sense addons (since the official release); - Have a lot of bugs; - A game with no point, nothing to do... You get sick of it quickly (unless you start playing in servers full of plugins (or mods). But that\u0027s not the game content); - Non-sense ending! A dragon WTF?! There could be a truly explanation (and end) for a square-ish world! And it could be more original and less cliché; - Several features that Notch promissed to include not included; - Despite being a light game, when on high settings runs only in NASA pcs (and have not \"that\" good graphics); - Barely made GUI; - It could have missions, portraying the story of herobrine, but NO, it\u0027s just a **** non-sense sandbox! - It could be a lot better than it was, enjoying a lot more its features (that have no purpose). So that\u0027s it. For who overrate this game, that\u0027s my opinion... Loving minecraft is like loving water in a desert. It\u0027s not because of its \"awesomeness\", but because the other bad and boring games we have today. Who don\u0027t play anyother game, try a truly good one (such Age of empires, C\u0026C, Total annihilation, etc) before saying **** (\"MINECRAFT IS THE BEST GAME EVER\"). There you see that MC isn\u0027t a so good game. (SORRY FOR MY ENGLISH, IMN\u0027T A FLUENT SPEAKER XD)… ",

This game is fun mostly whilst playing with your friends and online. Without those features, the offline is boring and lonely, which is sad as I have seen people who make videos of Minecraft offline with or without modifications have so much fun which makes no sense to me. Now for the gameplay features, it is simplistic which I like. You punch blocks to make blocks, to make tools to get better blocks. The bosses are boring however and require nothing else but SHOOT THE THING and the AI is ok. The enemies are intelligent enough and the friendly creatures are responsive to you killing them. The graphics aren\u0027t next generation but are stylised with the game and getting a graphics modification ruins the feel so don\u0027t. However it runs like crap as it uses Java script as the coding language and it really isn\u0027t ideal with making three dimensional games with such expansiveness. As of bugs, the only ones I see are shading errors and generation problems but overall a good built game, and I am not surprised as of how many people actually play this game and bug report. Overall this game is good and I see appeal to those who want to play games that are expansive and simple and I find it OK. 7/10… ",

But, I can\u0027t say minecraft is flawless, and I\u0027m going to give my honest review. Minecraft is a great game, and it is a truly open world sandbox, where your minecraft world ends with you. This Game is definitely a mark in video game history, and I hope this game leads to new ideas for future sandbox games. First, I\u0027ll start with survival. My first time, like most new players, was rough. Minecraft kind of puts you in the wild and says \"you\u0027re on your own, have fun\". But that\u0027s not that bad, it adds a bit of the charm to the game, and that there is lots to learn to do, and aim for. It also introduces you to the minecraft community, as you rely on it to learn more about the game, and how to play it. I\u0027ll talk more about the MC community later, as it plays a big role in the game. As you learn more and more, you explore your world, survive ravage nights, and build whatever you can imagine. Minecraft life will have many things to do, make, or explore. this review was made in ver 1.7.9, and there is a point where you have done it all, and once you\u0027ve explored the game inside and out, the game starts to lose steam, the game-play isn\u0027t that interesting past that for the most part. Then there is creative mode, where you are invincible, and can build (or destroy) with few limits. now, back to the community. The minecraft community is the absolute best, and really works hand and hand with the game to make it bigger and better, in a way I have never seen in any other game. if you have a decent amount of tech smarts, or look up tutorials, there you will really get the full effect of the minecraft community\u0027s mark on the game, and get more out of the game when you\u0027ve explored it all. First off, the I am so impressed by what, amateur developers that loved the game, created in the minecraft community. There is like a mod for Freaking everything; shooting kamehameha\u0027s, guns, weapons from RWBY, SAO, KH, etc, Pokemon, magic, npcs, superpowers, bosses battles, alternate dimensions, you name is, it\u0027s most likely a mod for it, and will being the game to life. In addition, there are also resource packs to change the look and feel of the game. and Many maps custom maps; from an epic adventure map (most likely made by Hypixel), a survival world with the creators flare, recreations of other things or places, or just an awesome looking thing someone built. Don\u0027t even get me started on multiplayer server, minigames and stuff. Even outside of gameplay, youtubers have made minecraft so popular, and really something that people enjoy. Now here comes the sad part of this review. The flaws of minecraft. The wonderful things the minecraft community brings to the game will keep you entertains for a long time, but it also starts to die. Minecraft\u0027s huge gaping hole that keeps it 2 points away from a 9/10 is the gameplay. Im sorry, but you the battle mechanics are pretty... eh, and just barely passes as enjoyable. Way you move, the way you fight, and just the way your character performs, it\u0027s just... ok.... it passes, and it wouldn\u0027t take away from the minecraft experience, but once it\u0027s you\u0027ve explored everything, and you\u0027ve exhausted your creativity, tried many mods, the game dies there. Gameplay is an important part of if you would come back to the game, and a game like this can\u0027t be played for a plot. but another point was deducted for the way the game is being improved. as more and more updates have come out, less and less is actual added. The updates just aren\u0027t giving me anything to return to the game to do something new.These flaws will not affect new players, but more players that have played minecraft for a while. If this ever changes in future versions, I would gladly give this game a 8/10, maybe even a 9/10. It hurts me that I had to give this game 7/10, but, I just can\u0027t go any higher. overall, you will love Minecraft, and if you\u0027re a gamer, get this game. Let your imagination and exploration run free. And a tip, take shelter before the sun sets in the game, because the night is evil.… ",

The possibilities are literally endless here, and that\u0027s what makes this such a success. I\u0027ll talk about the \"Game\" part of it first. Some people on Metacritic have criticized the game\u0027s Survival mode for being \"forgettable\". Those people definitely didn\u0027t play multiplayer. Minecraft, in any mode, is way more fun with friends. Either host your own game server, which you can download from the game\u0027s website, or join one of the many public community servers. Most of these servers are multi-world and offer a little bit of everything Minecraft has to offer. Setting up a server takes a bit of tech knowledge, but it only gets confusing if you\u0027re trying to run the server with mods or plugins. The combat in Minecraft is very basic. This part definitely could have been better. No matter what the enemy\u0027s preferred method of attack is, the combat of the player in Minecraft is nothing but \"hit it with a sword until it dies\", which can still be surprisingly intense when you\u0027re defending your home from the infamous creepers- silent, stealthy enemies that approach the player and explode, damaging the surrounding environment. And of course, that\u0027s the entire point of Minecraft- the editable environment. You craft tools and use them to dig or mine blocks, which can be blocks of dirt, stone, and even man-made or crafted materials like wooden planks and glass. The survival mode requires you to use tools to break blocks, while the game also features a creative mode, where players don\u0027t have to worry about enemies, and can access infinite amounts of any block and break them instantly, using this mode to create massive intricate building designs. Some even create pixel art using the various colors of wool block. The game\u0027s controls and mechanics- the inventory system and hotbar- are easy to learn on-the-fly. You\u0027ll be mining and crafting within minutes of creating your first world. Crafting in Survival is lacking something very important, however, and this is something that\u0027s bugged me about Minecraft since day one- there is no crafting tutorial! Games that use crafting systems usually tell you what items you need, but in Minecraft, not only do you have to know what items you need to craft, but you also need to know how to arrange them- a fact that\u0027s completely ignored by the game. Someone who\u0027s picking this up for the first time either experiments and screws around until he/she finally learns how to make a crafting table, or looks on the wiki for crafting recipes. The game is still constantly being updated and new content is being added. Bugs are still present, though they fix loads of them in every update and none of them are game-breaking. All in all, if you\u0027ve got a creative mind and haven\u0027t picked up this game yet, you really should. It\u0027ll suck away hours of your time, but it\u0027s totally worth it.… ",

However, a lack of a built in tutorial, button-mashing combat,, repetitiveness, and lack of balance undermine (pun not intended) the gameplay experience. Overall, it is a game worth buying, though some issues still show beyond its hype. First, the good. It has in-depth features, such as a huge branching crafting system, a smelting system, and a brewing system for potions (in game items that can give players, NPC\u0027s and enemies buffs and debuffs), and a fun, but not necessarily advanced, enchanting system. The expansive worlds allow the player to explore and build huge structures. The full PC version (not the classic or console versions) has an infinite world to explore, exploit, and build in. The world generation algorithm creates diverse worlds, with everything from mountains to oceans. Every world is unique, and the ability to choose and share the world generation \"seed\", or the code that starts the random number generator in the generation algorithm, allows players to find their perfect world. The game also has unrivaled replayability, as every game is different, with different worlds and different approaches, this game can get you glued to your chair for hours. Different game modes (the creative, survival, and hardcore modes) allow you to choose how to play the game, whether you want to go into god-mode and build huge castles, or survive in a wooden cabin with limited materials. However, the issues start becoming apparent as you start playing the game. The lack of a tutorial results in your first few hours of gameplay being just \"How do I do this again? I have to go online and search on a fan-made website, again!\" ad nauseam. The melee combat is simple and limited to button mashing. Newer updates have made changes, such as \"critical hits\". a game mechanic where the damage done increases slightly if the player jumps before hitting the enemy, but the melee combat is still somewhat repetitive, in my opinion. Despite its replayability, it still becomes repetitive over time, as you spend a lot of your time digging huge tunnels to find that one more diamond you need to make a new tool. The game also has a complete lack of balance. Coal and iron are supposed to be the most common underground minerals in the game, as they are low and medium tier items respectively, but I frequently find stacks of redstone (a high-tier item) before I even find any coal, when digging underground. In conclusion, while minecraft is a worthy buy, with many features, an expansive world, and replayability, issues, such as a lack of a built in tutorial, button-mashing combat,, repetitiveness, and lack of balance seriously ruin the gameplay.… ",

After browsing for a while trying to determine whether or not I wanted another Total Miner lookalike I bought the beta copy of Minecraft and started playing. Within the first ten or fifteen minutes I was blown away by the size and capacity that Minecraft delivers, and awe-struck when presented with all of the builds and creatures that killed me the first night. It was amazing. Now that the complete version has been around for some time, and after quite a few add-ons and updates, its no problem for me to say that as an arcade game Minecraft will stay number one for as long as it pleases, and as for a PC game, well, it sets the bar for all open world creator genres, and has easily distinguished itself to me as being one of the top ten best video games of all time.… ",

First of all, the price for the PC version is ridiculous - for the same amount of money, you can get a big hit game with a lot more content, better quality and better support. Even though the price seemed too much, I wanted to give it a try. After all, I\u0027ve played for quite some time the mobile versions of the game (Android and iOS), which were enjoyable - but priced more accordingly. I\u0027ve bought the game from their online store, paid using PayPal but never got the game. It turns out, their customer service is terrible. It took them more than a week to reply to my support request - and when they did, I got a blunt reply back. This is not the way to treat a customer. Yes, Minecraft is a unique game - and it has a lot of potential, but unfortunately the people behind it seem to be more focused on the profits right now than on the quality. I\u0027ve only managed to play the demo version on PC which seems quite average. The graphics are nice at first, but they become annoying after a while - luckily there are plenty of mods to fix this. The performance is average - games with better graphics run a lot better on the same machine. Despite having a very large modding community, it does not have an open API. Considering the plans for expanding into a MMO style setup (Minecraft Realms), I\u0027m wondering what\u0027s the future of modding in a setup like this. Conclusion: Until they decide to improve the quality of the game, to implement a better customer support system (and fix their payment service), I really cannot recommend this game, unless you\u0027re looking for trouble.… ",

Minecraft is whatever you want it to be. It provides you with a feeling of freedom that a lot of other games want to make you believe you have. It\u0027s not as simple as \u0027just a building game\u0027, it encourages you to reflect upon yourself and see how far you can take it. And that\u0027s where I believe the true magic of Minecraft shines. It\u0027s not about the game anymore, it\u0027s about showing yourself and the community how creative, artistic and smart you are just by using the same blocks everyone has and placing them in a way no one has thought of yet. It\u0027s a social platform. So yes, the game has it\u0027s flaws. It can feel \u0027choppy\u0027, chunks can ben slow when loaded and pigs seem to be spinning all over the place and climbing trees. Also, the developers make promises that sometimes can take a long time to actually fulfill. But none of this is actually \u0027gamebreaking\u0027. Simply put, none of this matters..

Graphics Minecraft\u0027s graphics are charming it doesn\u0027t go back to the Pac-man age nor does it go to the graphics of Call of Duty, It just looks Charming. The mobs range from looking cute to looking menacing, from explosive to simple. The Blocks look anywhere from \"Ooh this looks interesting\" to \"This makes my eyes hurt so much\". The lighting in the game is pretty balanced because when it\u0027s day, it\u0027s not blinding light, and when it\u0027s night, its not dark where you can\u0027t see anything. Graphics 7.75/10 GamePlay Minecraft has two main modes of play. Survival, and Creative. I won\u0027t be going into creative but to sum it up, You have Unlimited Resources and you can build anything you want in Creative. In Survival, you can break blocks, craft tools, go mining, and fend off the mobs at night time. But in Survival you NEED to set a goal for yourself to not get bored. You can\u0027t just say \"i\u0027m going to just do whatever\" halfway though your diamond hunt en devour, you need to say \" I want to build a mountain into a death cave\" of course that doesn\u0027t mean that you HAVE to do that before you start up your first world but you do need to get inspired to play Minecraft. Also you will need a guide of some sort, here is a link to help you survive your first night http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Beginner%27s_guide you may to read the entire thing as minecraft doesn\u0027t hold your hand. Gameplay 8/10 Multiplayer Minecraft in multiplayer is basically single player with friends in SMP (Survival Multi-player) However setting up a server can be difficult without knowing what you are doing but if everyone is on your network, you can just set your game to LAN Mode and it\u0027ll be hosted just fine. Multiplayer 6.5/10 Community Ok so many avid Minecraft players may be wondering why i have not mentioned the Community in the Universe of Minecraft. Well it deserved its own segment in its reviews, basically the community is huge, with more than 16,668,090 people with the full game you bet your @$$ there is a giant community. Because Minecraft is coded in java, the game can easily be modded and even in game you can do a lot with the in game redstone. The community knows this all to well, there are Millions of servers many have custom minigames, there is SO MUCH to do in the Community. But as always there are real sticks in the mud so thats the only bad thing about the community that. Community 9.25/10 Personal Story When i heard about Minecraft i was very interested, i got the game for Christmas and played it so much every day. lately Mojang has had a rough time and i wanted to write this before Minecraft is just a game i own and rarely come back to. as I see the game grow and the Community, It looks like seeing your friends kid grow up, you were with them and you felt good for your friend. I remember when the premium account number was jut below 12 Million, how I felt i was part of something very giant. It pains me that something that I loved so dearly is now a mere memory for me, but, someday maybe i\u0027ll come back and see how much of a game Minecraft was to me. and how i should give it another shot.… ",

Redstone, complex buildings, and clever contraptions or trickeries... Literally endless.… ",

After developing it for many months, Markus decided he couldn’t handle the game on his own, and founded the company Mojang which still works on the game today. The main goal of Minecraft is to do what you want. There is no set goal, no save the princess, no destroy the bad guys plot. There are two game types. Laid back, relaxed creative mode, where you can get anything out of your inventory, and the challenging survival mode, with monsters, starvation, damage, and resources must be gathered. Creative mode, the most popular among the two with the younger gamers, or just people with low-end pc’s that can’t handle the game too well, is very good for testing things so that you don’t build something in your survival world, only to find out it doesn’t work. Most people have a “test world” a world in which they put all of their builds, mainly using redstone, in to make sure they were reliable and worked for survival mode. Survival mode, the more fun game mode (in my opinion) is very challenging, as you start with nothing and have to work your way up. Some times living off of rotten flesh as a food source, you must find a way to survive once night hits, allowing the monsters to spawn. One of the best parts of the game however, is that it’s open-sourced. You can go into the game code and change whatever you like, which allows for any type of mod you’re looking for, whether it makes the game easier, or makes it much more hostile, or just increases performance of the game on your computer.… ",

    "comments": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view. I personally think this game could have been way better. First I will talk about the pros of the game. Yes, Minecraft encourages creativity and gets us to use our imagination, and this is appreciated. However, if you do singleplayer creative, it gets boring after a while, and if you do creative on a server, you will run into endless encounters of being griefed, trolled, etc. However with thg future updates being released, Creativity is probably Minecrafts true aspect to play this Game. Creative mode is greatly appreciated. Well, to be honest, that\u0027s all I can really think of when talking about the pros of Minecraft. I don\u0027t believe Minecraft is good enough to be a Survival, or PVP game. What am I talking about? Well if you play survival, you build a house and survive the night. Maybe do some other things. It just feels like the updated don\u0027t really do anything to benefit Survial mode, the updates are just added for the sake of being added. It\u0027s like you play for a while, get bored, then play when new update comes out, get bored play when new update comes out etc. I really find it a pain in the @ss when playing Survial mode (and no I am not a noob at Survival). I also believe that PVP is by far the WORST aspect of Minecraft. Firstly Diamond Armour (Enchanted and Non enchanted) really ruins the whole purpose of PVP as it is FAR better than the other armors. Minecraft PVP is not dynamic at all. It\u0027s literally people whacking each other repeatedly non stop. I dare to say that Call of Duty has a better PVP experience than Minecraft. (And Call of Duty is a piece of **** There is absolutely no dynamics to Minecraft PVP is literally people whacking each other repeatedly. Enderpearls really ruin the aspect of PVP as well. Why? Well you can fight someone and almost kill them, then they just teleport away and you can\u0027t do anything. Enderpearls really defeat the **** purpose of Skywars (A game type on multiplayer).Enchantments add to the unbalance of PVP because they are way too overpowered, and give the user a massive advantage.The last reason why PVP sucks in Minecraft is well....LAG Lag is one of Minecrafts biggest issues, and it\u0027s unfortunate that Mojang made Minecraft in Java. Java is probably the worst thing to code a game in, because it causes Lag as explained, and it\u0027s also easy for hackers to edit the coding to their liking and cheat. So when you get killed by a hacker in Minecraft PVP, remember that hacker probably wouldn\u0027t be a hacker if Minecraft hadn\u0027t written the game in Java. The Next issue I want to point out is the Graphics of Minecraft. Many people say, \"Oh the graphics of a game don\u0027t really matter\". REALLY??? would you Play games like Skyrim if they had the same graphics as Daggerfall? Would you play GTA V if it had the same graphics as GTA San Andreas? I don\u0027t think so... Another big factor deteriorating the game is the Community. Hackers, Greifers, Trolls, 12 year old homophobics, 6 year olds who whine and complain, people who think that they\u0027re all that, and Stupid and Biased server owners and admins really makes up Minecraft servers and the Minecraft community in a nutshell. In other words, 95% of the people who play minecrap are pieces of ****!!! Ok so maybe you stopped reading my review after I said that, but YOU KNOW it\u0027s the ugly truth. Minecraft could have been such a better game if Mojang actually knew what the **** they were doing. But it\u0027s ok, I forgive them for being Nooby developers. *** Well on A positive note, Minecraft is unique from any other game that\u0027s out there (both in good and bad ways), and If you are Lucky, can find a server where these issues are at a minimal. Speaking of servers, there is pretty much a server for just about every feature of Minecraft which is greatly appreciated.… ",

But what those people dont understand, is what the games they usually play are lacking which Minecraft has - Creativity and Fun. I\u0027m a solo player, not by choice, but by extremely slow internet, and i tend to really enjoy a few hours of Minecraft every once in a while. Command blocks are something i havent touched yet, but i\u0027m enjoying the creation of different factories and mechanisms with redstone. Exploration is also quite nice once you overcome the \"i wont to break everything\" phase. The main and only quest of the game, is to kill the Ender Dragon, which does not make any difference, if you do or dont. Minecraft is a great and fun game to play, but it\u0027s lacking a story line, quests, and role-playing. This is perhaps something that will be implemented in the near future, and it will bring in a much broader audience. Another huge issue i seem to have and cannot seem to get use to is the really, really bad animations that the mobs seem to have; They either walk straight, no bobbing, no attack animations, and make me wonder why im playing the game every time. Monster animations should be the main focus for a few months at Mojang, and Shaders are also another great concern. So based on visuals, animations and story-line, i wont be giving a great review for Minecraft. It\u0027s really good and has a massive community, but it needs a lot of work still, and fast.… ",

The absence of a tutorial of any kind forces to check the Wiki countless times; when not constantly checking the Wiki, I completely forgot that certain recipes even existed. The nice part is that one can modify the world as desired: (almost) every block is breakable, and reusable for whatever building you have in mind. Complex and bizarre mechanisms are possible thanks to the redstone components, and that\u0027s great. The success it had created a fervent community, but lazy developers.

Terraria and Don\u0027t Starve are much better games because they add a purpose to the whole thing. Minecraft is very unfriendly to new players: for the recipes you have to go to online wikis, management of the inventory is tedious, and the graphics are ugly, especially those of the mobs. Still, even if it\u0027s a somewhat enjoyable game, it doesn\u0027t deserve the hype around it at all.… ",

Gameplay wise it plays extremely well.... simple controls and easy game to learn, and it plays surprisingly smoothly, which makes the game a pure gem and is a wonder to play. But the building is the part of the game that I get so excited with. You can literally build anything and if you really wanted to cover the world in building after building after building, and when your finally done go down into a cave and explore, crafting and building while you do it. This is a game of unending possibility, and through the support of modding, that part of the game is taken so much further. This is a masterpiece, and although the mechanics are so simple, it will always be a game i will remember and cherish for a very, very long time. This is one of those games that you say \"just 5 more minutes\", and an hour later you have built some sort of castle that will about 100 blocks long, and that is the pure value that this game is remembered for. There are loads of items to craft, places to explore, stuff to mine, things to build, kill.... This game has a perfect mix of exploration, building, and pure fun, and if you don\u0027t have this game right now, go for it.... you will be in for a very pleasant surprise.… ",

However, once you defeat the Ender Dragon the game becomes something that only exists for bragging rights. There\u0027s also Hardcore mode, which locks the game at hard and gives you only one life. This is the ultimate challenge, and gives the game more length once beating the main survival. Then there\u0027s creative, which gives you no limits on what you can create. This is by far the best single player option, as someone who bought the game to build, not to destroy. Building 8-bit representations of my favorite game characters has given me a reason to build on, along with the easy to use controls and menu setup. Lastly, there\u0027s multiplayer (or, \"servers\"). This is why I keep coming back to Minecraft. The sheer amount of servers is staggering, and seeing the amount of dedication the community has put into this game is amazing. From Grand Theft Auto to Titanfall to even Hide-and-Seek, there is a server for almost any game you would want to play. This is the reason you should buy Minecraft; the single-player is well designed, if not a little repetitive, but the multiplayer is so good and the community so dedicated that this game will suck up your life even more so than something like World of Warcraft. The game is also fairly cheap, so it won\u0027t dig a hole in your pocket.… ",

Feed the Beast, Crazy Craft, Hexxit.. take your pick. Most of the modpacks even come with launchers so you don\u0027t have to manually install the 100+ mods they can have. \"is glitchy ash f*kk\" Well most of the glitches you address have been fixed or are being worked on, you reviewers from 4 FREAKIN YEARS AGO! XD why am I even doing this. \"nu sherver bwowser\" Well Minecraft really isn\u0027t the type of thing that does that. There are tens of thousands of servers out there, and it would clog the thing with servers you don\u0027t care about. Like TF2 or CSGO. Instead, they have an option to bookmark servers in your Multiplayer list to quickly join them right away. This is simple and straightforward. Find server, get on, like it, bookmark it, keep playing. \"howwible gwaphix\" No. No, no, no. If you don\u0027t like retro-looking graphics, that\u0027s your choice. There are countless resource packs out there that look \"better\" than the defaults. I personally love it, and sometimes use Faithful 32x. This game is awesome and don\u0027t let anyone tell you different. Definitely worth the $25.… ",

Therefore, Minecraft is being transplanted to many video games. Therefore, I pleasantly waited for playing Minecraft. However, Minecraft was very dull and foolish game for me. Minecraft disappointed me very much. Many people say [Minecraft can do everything]. However, actually, Minecraft cannot do anything. Pleasures of video games are below. - Players can travel uncharted place, and meet many people, and battle strong enemies. - Players are defeated many times by evil enemies and mysteries, and difficult traps. Then, players practice many times, and get many information and techniques. Finally, players defeat evil bosses. - Finally, players achieve the goal, and can get the feeling of achievement. However, this game has nothing. Moreover, this game does not have any manuals. This game can do only one thing. It is that [player can wander the world with very bad resolution without any goals, without any adventures]. Therefore, I hate Minecraft.… ",

InAll the negative reviews of this game I\u0027ve seen have extremely bad grammar and all they talk about is the bad graphics and AI. I presume those people will then go back to playing match after match of Call of Duty and calling each other filthy Mexicans and other racist remarks. It\u0027s a shame those people are too thick to realise that Minecraft is one of the greatest games in existence. In reviews I usually start with the story, but there is no story in Minecraft. I then talk about the gameplay, but most of the gameplay is hard to explain. There\u0027s combat with monsters that come out at night, but that\u0027s not the main part of this game. Infact what you spend most of your time doing is explained in the title: \u0027Mine\u0027 and \u0027Craft\u0027. There\u0027s also a lot of building, but Minebuildcraft was a bit of a mouthful. There are two gameplay modes; Survival, where you are plonked in a randomly generated world with lots of different biomes, ranging from deserts to jungles. You have limited resources and have to work hard if you want to build something as simple as a house you need a tool to gather the resources (i.e. an axe) and you have to re-arrange the materials you collected in the shape of a house. There\u0027s another mode called Creative, where you have infinite resources, can fly around and destroy blocks instantly, and you are invincible. It\u0027s rather fun but can get dull, so most of the time you\u0027ll use it to practise your building skills and exploiting the game\u0027s mechanics. All the terrain is constructed from metre squared blocks, and you destroy and place them individually. This allows you to build amazing structures, and if you haven\u0027t seen what the community has built just look up \u0027Top Ten Best Minecraft Creations\u0027 or something along those lines and prepare to die from shock. There\u0027s also no gravity for blocks, so you can place two blocks, one on top of the other, destroy the bottom one, and the top one will float in mid-air. And before you **** start saying \u0027Uh that\u0027s unrealistic\u0027 and go back to watching paint dry for another three days, if blocks were affected by gravity you wouldn\u0027t be able to build roofs. I would go on, except there\u0027s so much content in Minecraft I\u0027d go insane for the fourth time this year if I did that. And you really should buy this game and experience it for yourself. I\u0027ve played it for far over 200 hours and it\u0027s still fun to start a new game and gradually work up from crying in a dirt and wooden shack, to living in a mountain-sized castle with an animal farm and zombie slaves in the basement. And if you don\u0027t like this game then you obviously have no creativity whatsoever, and should go back to playing whatever triple-A turd the big companies produce like chickens in the claustrophobic hen house.… ",

Most complaints for Minecraft come from those who play the single player, who find it boring. I personally think singleMinecraft is an outstanding game with ideas that can be very unlimited to imagination with wide-ranged settings and environments. While not perfect and not a 10/10, Minecraft is very close to a 10/10 and is a landmark for PC open-world games and PC games in general. Most complaints for Minecraft come from those who play the single player, who find it boring. I personally think single player is better than the multiplayer. Two aspects of single player that make it so good are the creative and survival mode, and I will go into full detail on each one why because that is the only way to review this game. Survival mode, admittedly, is grindy; however, I think that the survival mode being grindy is a positive thing, as this allows you to create a relationship with you as your character in your survival situations. I believe Minecraft in survival mode, when played in a true gamer\u0027s aspect, is what the player would do in real life if forced to live in those conditions. THAT IS WHAT A SURVIVAL GAME IS MEANT TO DO. Not to mention that it\u0027s fun, addictive, easy to learn, good controls, and you will get many hours of gameplay. The infinite seed and terrain coding is a HUGE part of what makes survival mode so interesting. The difficulty range is well done and polished. The timing in day and night is well done. The survival mode patches come out with new, interesting, and innovative content that is just free-to-download with no micro-transactions bull crap. The map system isn\u0027t the best, but is a tiny nitpick in a huge world of free-roam terrain. The only glaring problem with survival mode is the viability of gold, which equals zero, despite its rarity. By the way, for those complaining about there being no real story, it\u0027s a sandbox, get over it. Survival mode: 10/10 You thought I praised the survival mode too much? Creative mode is just as good! Whether you want a real world with survival aspects, or just flat ground for building, creative mode has no limits. Your imagination is the only limit, as many things were already built within the last 6 years of existence. The designs hardcore players make, and there\u0027s a lot of them, are extremely detailed and really cool since you can explore those worlds with little rules. As far as the usable items, all it is is what exists in the game. Creative Mode: 10/10 Multiplayer is probably the most fun part about Minecraft, and the most problematic. Multiplayer opens up so many opportunities for game-defining minigames, which are suprisingly doable on the servers people create! I have made a couple of friends on Minecraft back whenever I played it way too much, and that\u0027s where you run into problems. 65% percent of the fanbase make multiplayer not fun and are sailor-speaking 10 year olds with no common sense or wannabe trolls that just make the game worse. Mojang couldn\u0027t at least put a censorship program for comments? The worst problem however, is the lag on most popular servers, as Mojang couldn\u0027t get the game to handle the online servers very well for a long time. Easily the worst problem with the game is those STUPID EXTERNAL SOURCES, ESPECIALLY MODS! Mods are so hard to download, you have to change the network and LAN party settings to get them to run. What the hell? Despite those difficulties however, Minecraft is an innovative and mind-blowingly brilliant game. The single player allows you to connect with yourself in immersing fashion, and the multiplayer is one of the most fun and addicting multiplayers of all time. All for the price tag of.......... $27. $27!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! How is Mojang even gratifying themselves with this? This has to be one of the best values for a PC game of all time. This price is cheaper than Ride to Hell: Retribution! I thought about giving this a 10/10 for its sheer greatness, but with the numerous problems I ran into while on multiplayer or with mods, not to mention the reputation this game eventually got, I just couldn\u0027t. I give this game an extremely high 9/10! PC gamers, go buy this game. Go to the official website, use your online credit card and buy the game. It\u0027s that simple.… ",

So you\u0027re probably wondering why I rate it a big fat ZERO when my opinion of the game is so high. Well to be frank the community is ruined beyond repair and you will never find a decent server that actually lasts. The average age of Minecraft players is around 10, and even if there are a few older players most of those are really immature or vapid. For example I met one guy in his late twenties and all he did was build box houses. Which leads me to my main quarrel with the community; nobody actually builds things anymore. It is a shame that the ultimate sandbox has been turned into a cheap survival/PVP game by stupid brats. Most servers are p2w now, the last one I played on gave full protection 4 armor to players who \"donated.\" I consider myself a builder, I made really nice things in this game, and was made staff on a few servers because my builds were so high quality. It was immensely frustrating to me because no one else seemed to even try and servers ended up full of ugly box houses no matter how much the server\u0027s staff stressed the importance of good building. Mojang is not enforcing their EULA and taking down servers that violate it by selling overpowered items. They will not even take the time to reply to your report apparently. What really grinds my gears though is they\u0027ve put the last year of development into making a \"PVP update\" that basically caters to the same PVP crowd that has turned Minecraft multiplayer into a p2w PVP fest. Mojang could easily go after the few websites that allow players to set up these \"donation\" shops but I suspect those websites have bribed them into looking the other way by giving them a portion of the profits.… ",

Что же такое майнкрафт? Майнкрафт - это замечательная игра в жанре приключения, или же песочница. У этой игры нет сюжет, и вам никто не будет говорить что вам делать, делайте то - что хотите. Путешествуйте по миру, стройте дома, ухаживайте за животными или растениями, копайте шахты, добывайте ресурсы,развивайтесь, боритесь с злыми монстрами, если хотите можете даже играть с друзьями в кооперативе и делайте всё это вместе. Если вам и вашем друзьям станет скучно на режиме выживания вы можете пойти на режим креатив, хардкор, или просто пойти играть на различных серверах. В режиме креатив - вы можете делать всё что хотите, стройте что хотите, в этом режиме вы бессмертны и у вас бесконечные ресурсы, дайте волю своему воображению! В режиме хардкор всё намного сложнее чем в простом выживание - у вас только одна жизнь, если вы умрёте то вы не возрождаетесь заново, вы просто начинаете всё с самого начало, монстров всё больше, и жизни восстанавливаются более медленно. Итог: Майнкрафт это отличная песочница, многие ругают её за пиксельную графику, но помоему это наоборот круто! Это пожалуй единственое что отличает её от других surviaval - игр. И кстати, именно майнкрафт был одной из первых survival - песочниц в игровой индустрии. Моя оценка 9.7 / 10… ",

It\u0027s singeplayer survival mode is exciting, bold, and adventuresome, but quickly gets tiring and isn\u0027t something I would play game after game. For a survival game, Minecraft relies heavily on all features BUT survival. Its graphics really aren\u0027t anywhere near as bad as people make them out, and since now you can change the way everything looks and clean up the environment with resource packs, dissing it for its pixelated graphics is ridiculous. The music is gorgeous, Daniel Rosenfeld is a complete genius, and I often listen to Minecraft\u0027s music outside of the game. Its one of my favorite soundtracks of all time. The multiplayer is dashingly fun, but while enhancing it, suffers from the same as the normal survival. Creative is of course a main feature, as building is in the name of the game here. And a great building system it is, as you can create some truly astonishing architecture, and take it a step further to design almost anything in creation, and then some, with command blocks. Custom maps go a step further and add the ability to share community created \"levels\", from parkour platformers to puzzle chambers to horror maps (and there are some VERY scary ones) to back-to-basics with a twist survival maps. Mods are probably more diverse for Minecraft than any other game, enhancing the experience a million times over and creating a never ending game. But the biggest shine for Minecraft, for me, is the dedicated servers. ANY sort of game, through plugins, right at the fingertips. The pure social interactivity makes the experience 3x longer. It has to be said though, the quality of the community has dropped dramatically in the last few years, with invasions of immature children being brought in by certain kid-based youtubers. However, there are plenty of wonderful people and youtubers alike out there to counter them. Overall, Minecraft kept me occupied for 3 years straight, and I still boot it up every once and again. For the price you pay for unlimited fun, its the most worthwhile $35 you\u0027ll ever spend.… ",

When i had the age of 10 or 11 it was actually one of my favorite games and still is a lot of fun to play and i actually started a new playthrough a few moths ago and the i just...dropped it... STORY: You appear out of nowhere!!...go mine and attack stuff to survive...THE END. PRESENTATION: This is usually the first thing that people bring up to critic this game and honestly i don\u0027t know why. I actually rather like this mixture between a retro-cubic-3D style of graphics and i don\u0027t think a construction game like this would\u0027ve been possible without them. The music is made up of different piano pieces and i feel like they fit very well. But the one thing that this games lacks is a stable frame rate, since the graphics are so basic you would think that this would run well, right?...RIGHT?, well no, the game runs very poorly even in the lowest settings and i don\u0027t even know the resolution is on. GAMEPLAY: Minecraft is a...umm... Building/Combat/Platform/RPG/MMO??....i think. I don\u0027t know really what this game is really. There\u0027s 3 different modes in the single player and there\u0027s also a Multiplayer mode, but i will focus more on the Single Player since that\u0027s what i play the most in my games. The mechanics are very simple. You use the W, A, S and D keys to move and you use the mouse to face the direction you wanna go. There\u0027s 2 motions that you do in this game: Mine and place, and you use the left and right clicky things on the mouse respectably to do them. They do exactly what the sound, you mine things or hit things depending on what your mining and when you do so the block or enemy that you mined or killed respectably will drop an item that you can put in your inventory. You can have 9 items in the \"Use\" inventory and by pressing E you will bring up the rest of it that will allow you to have more stuff with you. Aside from that you also have 4 extra spaces to the side of your character and depending on the item and pattern that you put in those 4 spaces, you can craft something, if you do a crafting table you are able to put 9 things on the \"Craft spaces\" and you can create different tools, armor blocks, etc. The right clicky thing on the mouse is used to interact with different things and defend yourself with the newly implemented shield that you put on your extra slot or...you know...you can put anything on there so you can use both of you hands. You also the right clicky thing on the mouse to place blocks on top of other blocks and construct...pretty much anything. You have a hunger meter that depletes over time and to keep it full you will need food from animals or your own harvest, why do you need to keep it full?, well the hunger meter will refill your health when you take damage and if it depletes 100% it will hurt you and leave you with the half of your last hearth. Minecraft respects this mechanics in all of its different modes like: Survival: You have limited resources, Limited health and hunger and if you can respawn. There\u0027s 3 difficulty settings and you just...have to survive. Hardcore: In this mode the difficulty is locked to Hard and you can only die once, if you do that world will be deleted. Creative: You can fly, you can break anything, you can spawn things at pleasure and you have unlimited resources. If you came here to build stuff...this is for you. There\u0027s some enemies in this game like Zombies, that just move around and attack you, Creepers that explode if they get to close, Withes that throw potions, Esqueletos that shoot arrows, the list goes on and on. Finally there\u0027s 3 bosses in this game: The Ender Dragon which is pathetically easy. The wither which you have to build your self by putting 3 wither skeletons heads (that you get on this games other dimension, the Nether) and soul sand...and he is very easy too. Finally there\u0027s the Guardian, he lives underwater and he\u0027s a pain on the butt to kill. All of these bosses will give you a reward like a Dragon Egg, a Nether star and a...sponge...uh. Now, i can go on and on about what you can do and can\u0027t do in this game because i haven\u0027t even mentioned the different Biome, the different blocks, the different minerals, the Multiplayer, the experience and...man this game is just overwhelming. I mentioned before that i dropped my game and that\u0027s because...there\u0027s too much to do and i feel that Minecraft lacks focus, plus most of the things in Minecraft requiere so much time and dedication that i just got bored. I am planing to go back to that save one day or another to finish what i was doing, but for now i have school and other games to occupy my time. Now for the score...out of all the games that i reviewed so far, i haven\u0027t had so much trouble on putting a score. This is a game that really, REALLY depends on your taste for video games. Personally i really like building games so i really like Minecraft, but i feel it can be really boring at times. I\u0027ll give it a 7/10.… ",

You can definitely have fun with this game building forts and houses and visiting the netherworld. The game itself works and you can have lots of fun with friends and online. The possibilities are endless, but also pointless and repetitive too. The enemy mobs, while iconic, are worthless which can be easily avoided. This makes underground exploring not very fun, and only a handful of structures are there to explore anyway. Ore mining is alright, finding diamonds is pleasant but not challenging. Some mechanics aren\u0027t thought out very well or are just unfinished. An example is potion brewing- it\u0027s pretty hard to access and the effects themselves are hard to craft, and are not TOO helpful. The game itself just seems dense from the surface, but once you dig in there actually isn\u0027t very much to see. Still, you can have some fun playing around making single player bases if that is what you really desire. The graphics and aesthetics are great which can be modified around, and the different biomes are empty inside but still pretty in their own way. I could\u0027ve easily given this game a 5 or even a 4, but since I rate games purely out of my enjoyment, I gave it an extra point. It\u0027s a decent game but I had some fun using redstone, playing with friends and joining online servers to PvP. It\u0027s still not a very fun game compared to its competitors. Minecraft is just the more popular, casual and dumbed-down sandbox version of other masterpieces.… ",

What I liked (* indicates a caveat - see following section): + Minecraft clearly popularized survival crafting games, for better or worse. Interacting with the environment and using it to your advantage by \"mining\" it and then \"crafting\" with it is the essence of the game and it is a relatively fresh concept. + There is a decent amount of content*(1). + The game clearly lends itself to co-operative multiplay, which I enjoy. Players have had some success with PvP due to novel situations you can get into with the mechanics, though I find it rather unsophisticated overall. + Minecraft will get you to think both creatively and geometrically. Mining and farming are matters of tiling, a classic category of math problems, based on a few facts you will learn contingently in-game. This encourages problem-solving skills not normally required in video games. Meanwhile, building aesthetic structures allows the player to express themselves in-game instead of following a railroad path so familiar to many modern games. + Item progression is relatively exciting and satisfying*(2). + Technically speaking, Minecraft is interesting for a number of reasons. It wasn\u0027t anywhere near the first game to use voxels in graphics and gameplay so extensively, but it popularized their use. Voxels are a kind of \"atomic\" graphical structure that constructs larger shapes out of smaller particles, not unlike LEGOs. Until Minecraft, they were mostly used outside of gaming for things like molecule imaging. Minecraft used fairly remarkable terrain generation algorithms to procedurally generate fresh worlds made out of voxels for each playthrough. + There is so much to do*(3), and the player can set their own pace. The game can be played in short bursts or in massive marathons and it lends itself to being rather addictive. What I didn\u0027t like: - *(1): There is a lot of content, but the way in which it is accessed is poorly conceived. Due to the terrain generation, most new content that comes in the form of new block types or new items needs to be reached by approaching the frontiers of what has already been discovered; for middle-to-old-aged worlds this can be several kilometers away from the starting point for a mere chance at visiting the new content. For instance, I easily have over 1000 hours in the game, and the \"mushroom island\" biome type was added to the world 4 1/2 years ago. I still have never encountered it. This flaw in the terrain generation algorithm forms the basis of several tedious game struggles later on, like finding a Nether fortress or village (necessary to acquire Eyes of Ender, items used to locate the final boss and \"End\" biome), finding biomes that were introduced years ago to experience all the content, or even finding content that is new to biomes that you\u0027ve already experienced. - *(2): In the beginning of the game, there\u0027s a clear material progression as you advance through wood-\u003estone-\u003eiron-\u003ediamond tools and armor. After this point, though, all progression comes in the form of using a rather contrived enchantment system that is frankly an inconvenience. Since this enchantment system requires wheat, sugar cane, cows, and trees you\u0027re somewhat limited to where you want to put your \"base\" unless you feel like traveling a great distance to visit your cows or want to try leading them across great expanses (the pathing AI is not that great). Even then, once you have gone through the bother of acquiring the 46 leather, 90 wood planks, 135 sugar cane, 4 obsidian, and 2 diamond necessary to max out enchantment (yes I know this off the top of my head), it becomes increasingly expensive to repair your super-items. - *(3): Most tasks in the game are about resource collection of some kind. There is combat and exploration but it is very lackluster. Once you\u0027ve seen an example of something you\u0027ve really seen it all. The rest of the game is about gathering resources, and this can be tedious. A few years ago one of the developers actually intentionally made crops slower to mature, not because he thought the game was too easy but just to make everything more tedious. Mining can take minutes upon hours of your time doing repetitive tasks to get modest gains, even when you meticulously plan it in a statistically favorable way and perfect all your equipment. - Many ancient bugs, like poor achievement detection and Nether portal calculation, persist to this day. - Numerous promises have been left on the floor: a modding API, more weapons than a sword or bow, a living villager economy, off the top of my head. - Devs are less imaginative than modders and have been spending the better part of 5 years inserting inferior versions of mods as patches. - The recent combat update adds more hackneyed decisions, hamstringing the player in pointless ways.… ",

A bad thing in the game is that there are many hacks on a multiplayer server, many use hack, which leaves very boring game.

Every time something good or special shows itself, something, usually from the fan base, pops up and ruins everything. Minecraft, i find, is most fun with some friends in survival or creating something in creative. Single player survival can be boring after a bit. after issue is the online player base should you not have any online friends, as it\u0027s mostly 12 year old scum, 6 year old try hards, and 30 something people riding that youtube money train. Many of the mini game modes on it are empty on american servers, as survival games (think hunger games but worse) and factions (think some mmo with clans but worse) are the popular ones as of late. Voice chat would be nice, as way too many times have i and others been killed before we could speak. Another thing is the nature of the game, as it runs off java, which for those 12 and under, was a basic programming code and a old 3d web browser game thing like flash was for 2d stuff. Java by this point has gone senile, a glitch randomly occurring which basically bricks your game, preventing little timmy from smashing his mother\u0027s acer facebook machine like a very colorful pinata... oh hell, that would still happen. Honestly, if you have some friends and wait a bit for 1.10\u0027s java issues, minecraft would be a blast, but if you\u0027re looking for a fun single player or online with randos experience, looking elsewhere would be advised.… ",

Dear lord, this update basically ruined the combat part ofI used to absolutely love this game, it had a simple concept, simple graphics, and the ability to do anything. But looking back, this game has gone down a crappy road thanks to Microsoft/Mojang and the Minecraft community itself. Let\u0027s start with what Microsoft did wrong after buying it from Markus Pearson: The 1.9 and update. Dear lord, this update basically ruined the combat part of the game. For starters the removed the ability to craft god apples, which although is little disappointing, but I can live without it. Also, they made it so you can\u0027t spam the left click button when in combat anymore, which may take some time getting used to, but it would probably be good to balance the combat. So why did I just mention these 2 things if they don\u0027t actually bother me? Well... I\u0027m not sure. BUT, the thing that does bother me is that the axes are now more powerful than all of the swords. Even a axe made of wood has equivalent power of a sword made of diamonds. Because of this tweak, the swords are completely pointless in crafting/using! Also, Microsoft/Mojang didn\u0027t actually add any new weapons to a update called: \"The Combat Update\". Which means to this day, Minecraft still only has 11 weapons... 10 of which are melee weapons. Now, let\u0027s see what the community did wrong: #1: The multiplayer severs, If you go on the internet to look for 100% vanilla Minecraft servers with no plugins/mods whats so ever, you\u0027ll relise there\u0027s no such thing anymore. All you\u0027ll ever see now is stupid minigames and \"factions severs\". Which although may seem fun at first, it eventually gets boring as hell. #2: The god awful and super annoying fanbase, where do I begin? The Youtube videos, the music parody\u0027s, videos of 6 year-olds, the Minecon convention (yes, they made a yearly convention just for 1 stupid video game), and many more. So cancerous, so stupid, so many \"please make it stop\" feelings. At the end of all of it, there are some good parts of the game, such as the singeplayer experience and... well, that\u0027s about it. Thank you for reading my review.… ",

What can you really say about this game that hasn\u0027t already been said? Nonetheless, let me outline some things that I like about it: and sometimes I\u0027ll \"compare\" it to Terraria since I like that game too. Story: good joke m8 Controls: Simple and intuitive: move with WASD, M1 for attack, M2 for other action, other keys for open inventory, drop item and swap hands. Simple, but it\u0027s a good simple. Graphics: Nice classic pixel art style: default textures are nice, but if you don\u0027t like them, USE A FREABKING RESOURCE PACK. Sound: Ambient music that only plays occasionally compared to Terraria\u0027s upbeat, constant music. Really sets the tone nicely. The sound effects also help: random creepy echoes if you\u0027re near a cave with monsters in it etc. Gameplay: Arguably the most important part of any game. And Minecraft does not disappoint. Simple to learn, simple concept, but you can do literally anything as long as you put in the time to do it. There are tons of different biomes to explore and discover. There are dungeons to loot and monuments to conquer. You have a combat system that appears simple: swipe when the meter\u0027s full to deal the most damage: but there\u0027s more depth with slower, but heavier-hitting axes, potions, using a shield to block your opponents attack: it\u0027s not complex, but it\u0027s pretty deep all things considered (but I still wouldn\u0027t say it\u0027s as fantastic as fighting giant eyes in Terraria). And then there\u0027s the thing you\u0027ve all been waiting for: the building. What can you say about it? Put in the time to make the build, and you can create something truly special: even a computer. Yes, a computer. Conclusion: Great, calming game that you can easily play for hours on end: perfecting your mob trap, finishing up and decorating your mansion, you name it, you can do it. Cons: it can get pretty repetitive, and you might even say boring, but it\u0027s easy to just start a new project, make a new world, and you can just keep on playing. (The community also isn\u0027t that great but you can\u0027t fault the game for that, can you?) (Surely Undertale and FNAF can agree with me, right?) In comparison to Terraria: they\u0027re both great games in their own rights, but they focus on different things. Terraria focuses more on exploration \u0026 combat, Minecraft focuses on creating things. Side note: I don\u0027t play too much multiplayer on public servers so that experience may be completely different: I\u0027m just there for the survival.… ",

Everything is made of “blocks” just like an 8-bit game but it is much smoother. It has an incredible concept and is available on Google Play, the App Store, PS4, Xbox One, and many desktop computers. But a downside is it’s not free, for the mobile version it is $6.99 and for the computer version in is $27.99. It has fairly simple controls on every platform and exciting gameplay. Minecraft is suitable for all ages and with a multiplayer function, the whole family can join a world and have hours of fun. I personally have Minecraft on all available platforms: Ipad-mobile, desktop computer-computer, and Xbox one-console. I first got Minecraft on an old Kindle Fire tablet, and the first hour I spent playing the game, was figuring out how the controls and all the other stuff works. When you first load Minecraft for the first time there is no tutorial but the controls are quite simple. Another thing I enjoy is the different “Mob”, monster, mechanics. With one Mob exploding and another one shooting arrows at me, it definitely created a fast pace in-game. About a year after I got the pocket edition, sometimes referred to as the mobile version, I decided to purchase the computer version and let me tell you, it was ten times better than the pocket edition (I’m not saying that the pocket edition is bad). With many more features than the pocket edition it provided much more entertaining gameplay. I haven’t spent much time on the Xbox one version, but of what I have seen has told me that it is worth your money. With easy access to multiplayer options the console version would suit an online player nicely. With all that being said, if you are a gamer and want a fun, action packed game but with simple graphics, then this should be a definite choice. The cost can be something that makes you not want to get this game, but after you have created an account, you can download it to virtually any computer. If you have a question about the gameplay, graphics, etc, just leave a comment and I’ll be sure to respond.… ",

I remember when I used to have an r7 240 minecraft at medium settings ran at 80FPS. Lets compare this to a game that actually uses graphics as an resource and actually looks better at even low settings. CSGO performs at high settings at 80fps. So how come a game revolving around blocks have the optimization that no other game should have? Simple developers were lazy as **** so they decided to just use a script for websites and phones instead of using a real game engine. I feel as if they should create minecraft on a completely new game engine (sort of like the Windows 10 version) however actually make it the EXACT same thing it is now. Another thing is the physics. They are stupid and actually dont make sense at all. The sense of creativity and exploration is the only good thing that brings me in. Mods and Friends are the only things that make this game even worth money. Minecraft creates a world which is easy to explore but annoying to play in. Verdict: If you like adventure games and exploring with friends, then maybe you should pick up Minecraft however this game is not worth its retail price as it is the exact same thing equivalent to tetris except its not optimized Pros: Fun Exploration Online Play Mod Support Cons: Worst Optimization ever Bad graphics *For Optimization Primarily* Community is worst then Call of Duty Milked from Bad Youtubers… ",

In Survival Mode, you\u0027re put in a huge randomly generated world with almost no pointers or directions. Your only goal is to survive. This game does a great job at making you feel vulnerable, as encountering a monster can easily result in you dying and dropping all of your items. All tools and armor will eventually break, you can break and collect almost any block, and you can craft items with materials you find. Other than surviving, there isn\u0027t really anything your aiming to do (although you can come up with your own goals if you want), you\u0027re just constantly exploring and getting more materials. Despite the lack of end-goal, exploring, mining, and surviving doesn\u0027t need one, which I\u0027m still not 100% sure on why. Then there\u0027s Creative Mode if you want to just build instead of surviving. This is where the graphics work to the game\u0027s advantage, as the size of the blocks makes building easy and simple, but still capable of producing detailed structures if they\u0027re big enough. Also, if those blocks were more detailed, it wouldn\u0027t fit aesthetically considering the world is made of blocks. Command Blocks also allow you to change certain aspects of the game, allowing you to create your own maps with unique rules. Due to this, you can make almost anything despite the use of blocks, and that\u0027s a testament to the game\u0027s creative potential. Whether you want to build or survive, this game has a lot to offer to you, and it\u0027s easy to see why it became so popular, especially since it keeps improving with updates.… ",

Since 2009, Mojang has been making the game better for people of all ages to ease into the gaming world by entering through the gateway to gaming (Even your grandma could learn the controls it’s that simple). This game, like no other, features key aspects which make it stand out to any other game on the market. The graphics on this game give most people a nostalgic throwback to the 90’s playing around in an 8-bit graphic sandbox but very creatively blended in with modern day shaders to make this game look like the mona lisa painted on an 8 bit colour palette. The game doesn’t need a story. Your keyboard and mouse make the story. Nobody knows where this character ‘Steve’ came from, but he is the only human to exist, surrounded by a vast world of 60 million square meters (Bigger than Earth!) which can be sculpted by your very own bare hands. The game features very ambient distinct music, which soothes any moment from running away from creeper in a mineshaft or just building your house to survive the first night. What makes this game special on computer is that it can be run on most modern day computers, ranging from the Intel Pentium laptops to the monster rig you got your grandma to buy you for Christmas to play a 90’s doom sandbox game. You even get the choice to play earlier versions of the game for more compatibility, not mentioning that the game is almost on every platform makes it very easy to get your hands on. However, in the recent years Mojang has come up with ideas to possibly make this game any better, but they have somewhat failed to do so. I think the game is complete and needs no further updates. Minecraft doesn’t need anything more to it, and every time they add new features to the game they are making it harder to gain an expanding audience. There also doesn’t need to be a market. Micro transactions are not the way to go. I wouldn’t mind buying the game for extra money to not get irritated by Microsoft’s scheme of an ingame currency to buy skins that has always been free to PC JavaScript version users. Overall, I think that Minecraft should not be improved and the game remains a piece of history in the museum of gaming which has changed the perspective of people who don’t see success in game if it doesn’t have ‘intense 4K texture graphic rendering’ and pay attention to the unique features of a game that has different features to the triple A games we have today.… ",

However, it suffers from a lack of polish and content. There are about 15 different kinds of enemies in the game, which is odd considering the variety of biomes. Combat is limited to swords and bows. There are only 5 tiers of tools/armors/weapons. Crafting also feels limited and item stack sizes are only 64. Bosses seem rushed and untested. The Ender Dragon is very difficult even on easy mode. There are several \"grindy\" parts of the game. For example, enchanting costs levels to perform, and even enchanting 2-3 items can take 1-4 hours of level grinding. To get to The End the first time requires 14-16 ender pearls which drop from a rare enemy. To summon the Wither boss requires 3 wither skulls which are a very rare drop from a very rare enemy.

Minecraft’s special point is that the game basically has no rules! Each time you enter into a new world, you are in a different map made by different blocks which can be destroyed and built into whatever you like. This freedom is what makes Minecraft a magical game - it gives you enough space and resource to create a world as you see fit. You can enjoy creating your own crazy ideas, exploring the world and completing your own map. Another special point is that the game obeys scientific principles to make the game world seem more real. For example, if you use the lighter on the tree, the tree will be burnt; if you cut a sand block down, other sand blocks over it will fall down. The fact that everything in the world acts as how you would expect it to be gives you a more natural game experience. Minecraft is really an awesome game that anyone can enjoy. It is great both as a single player game or as a party game that you can play with your friends. By yourself, you can mold your own special world; with friends, you can fight in a fighting map. No matter the situation, you can get a lot of enjoyment out of the game. Minecraft is also a game that can be enjoyed by players of all ages. Young kids can practice their ability of innovation through creating different things. Adults can stay out of the stress during the time they are playing this game. People of different ages can find different things to enjoy from the game, and this is what makes Minecraft suitable for both the young and old.… ",

Now let\u0027s make a list of the detailed issuesA good game that you shouldn\u0027t buy. Indeed, in this game lies the potential of greatness, a potential that would have to be unlocked by yourself nonetheless. However, while it proably deserves your time, it does not deserve your money for a number of reasons wich can be summed up quickly : the stupidity, greed and laziness of the devellopers. Now let\u0027s make a list of the detailed issues : 1. The devellopers are too stupid to programm a game correctly : There\u0027s no denying it, the way that this game has been coded is very amateurish, the fact that it runs on java is a dead giveaway. The game is very poorly optimized and for its poor graphics, uses a lot of superfluous resources from your computer, if you want to play it in a way that gives you an acceptable viewing range or relatively pretty graphics to admire your creations , be prepared to use a very beefy computer and forget about playing it that way on the go. 2. The devellopers are too stupid and morally corrupt to fix a BUG : If you want to make a functioning, complex piston machine there\u0027s one thing that will f*ck you over : the \"quasi-connectivity\" BUG, a BUG wich defies logic (because it\u0027s a BUG, duh), in the way that it creates unpredictable leaps of activation by redstone, in short, it goes against the principle of this game wich is \"block by block\" (not my words indeed, as the the official name of a Minecr*ft charity project is \"block by block initiative\"), and instead adds a whole bunch of nonsensical \"rules\" wich kill a lot of possibilities. Now, you surely want to ask, why do I stress the word \"BUG\" like a r*tard ? Well, it\u0027s simple, after this BUG was discovered, like with any BUGS, people started to exploit it to create new possibilities, and that is normal, however the ret*rded devellopers decided not to fix the bug and insted \"make\" it (make as in makebelieve) a \"feature\" (no, I\u0027m not kidding you https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-14664). I consider this to be the proof of two things : a huge part of the minecraft community (best exemplified by this person https://youtu.be/aRdcptG365I?t\u003d105), as well as the dev team are completely ret*rded and morally corrupt. You have to be either one of these things at an extreme or both if you think that a BUG wich breaks the game, could not a) be replaced by an actual separate FEATURE of the game b) not be given priority in every version of Minecr*ft, and instead be kept for those who absolutely need it in older versions, or even, god forbid, become optional (yes, yes, 10 years olds, its mind-blowing) 3. The devellopers need an eternity to create simple updates Updates for this game take several months to be realeased. That would be nothing unusual if the updates wouldn\u0027t consist of pretty much nothing. for example between november 2016 and June 2017 (1.11 and 1.12), the only major changes were better coloration and a turorial. If you want more evidence that the devellopers are lazy, look no further than the big layers of fat wich envellop Markus Persson\u0027s body, who, if you didn\u0027t already know, is the founder of Minecraft and has stopped working on it a while ago to sell it for 2.5 billions $ to Micro$oft and, thus proceeded to do, and still does, nothing all day. Considering this, you might agree that it would be amoral to buy this game, because I don\u0027t think it is really necessary for some incompetent nobodies to cash in on an idea that was made 10 years ago while seldom producing anything of worth. F*ck the lazy and stupid programmers, f*ck Micro$oft, f*ck the ret*rds that defend this game, and download a cracked version on the internet. Cheers.… ",

The item or block features are pretty simple,but they do have their own law to make this block world vivid.this is the most charming things for me.It has duplicated another world which has no stress no sorrow and always made me grin. Let\u0027s talk about the music by C418.The music doing a great job to reflect the loneliness and silent which are stick to the gameplay.they have become my favorite music right now and I cant fall asleep without listening the album XD. Yet this game is adding more and more new features.With those update,the fun is continued.Excellent job Mojang! (PS.hope the bedrock version on switch could release instantly)… ",

Basically Minecraft is an exact copy of the game it was at launch, with incredibly minor changes. One would think that microsoft would be able to make wonders when they took over, but they have really only turned it into a cash-grab mess.

That is how long I spent on this game. And the only mods I have ever used are Optifine and the Epicarno Mod. It says a lot about how much this game can offer. Now for my review of everything in the game. The Graphics: I hate the idiots who say: “MInEcraFT HAs bAd GraPhICs, sO I HatE It sO mUcH!” The graphics are a matter of personal preference, but since resource packs exist, that argument is kind of invalid. I don’t what your situation is, but I personally enjoyed the aesthetic of the game. The Story: Non-existent in a good way. Next! The Combat: The basic combat is pretty complex stuff, as you can tailor your playstyle around a variety of weapons. There are swords (basic, everyday weapons), axes (high damage, slow speed), pickaxes (breaks armour faster), bows (ranged alternative), and most recently, tridents (throwing weapons). The Building: The best gameplay aspect. Tons of blocks, infinite possibilities. I don’t see why people would hate on Minecraft other than to make themselves look cool. (I know, the community sucks. But that isn’t the game itself, that is the people playing it. Jeez.) Plus, the holy grail of all blocks, the Command Block, is in the game. You can essentially use Minecraft code in order to summon monsters, give yourself items, and even change how the game plays. The imagination really is your only limit. The Multiplayer: Mojang (and Microsoft), have pretty bad server connection. It can take ages to log onto servers for some people. I never really ran into this though, and my internet isn’t the stuff of your wildest dreams. The servers are amazing in this game, and I have made many friends by playing on servers such as Hypixel and Cubecraft. Basically, this game has actually changed my life and changed the way I think. This masterpiece deserves the 10/10. My only complaint is that Microsoft seems to add trivial features all of the time.… ",

And, despite having simplistic graphics, the game is incredibly immersive and has a very believable world even with the gravity defying physics and the fact that you can build a portal to \"Hell.\" Minecraft is one of the first PC games I ever played and still remains as my favorite open world survival game, it\u0027s just the recent changes and the community that bogs it down from being 10/10 for me.… ",

Dándole un concepto básico, son legos digitales. Es una forma divertida de pasar horas de juego a comparación con otros títulos que abarcan el género de construcción, éste tiene muchos aspectos a favor y facilidades en la jugabilidad, inventario y diseño que lo hacen atractivo y cómodo para el jugador. Sin embargo no demora mucho en encontrar cualquiera de sus numerosas fallas: funciones defectuosas características incompletas, una completa falta de multijugador, terrible inteligencia artificial, y para colmo, a pesar de su extenso mapa sandbox, el juego es ridículamente corto… ¿Dónde está el reto en todo esto? No es secreto para nadie que este título se convirtió en un Juego de Culto y una pieza importante en la comunidad gamer y la cultura pop. Minecraft es sin duda un juego revolucionario que ha dejado su lugar en la historia. Anque la audiencia de un juego no determina la calidad del juego. En este caso a mi parecer, no aporta nada, aparte de pasar un buen rato. Jugabilidad: 7/10 Personajes: 3/10 Historia: -/10 Diseño: 6.5/10 Entretenimiento: 8/10… ",

You had 2 game modes: Survival where your goal is to collect material build kill and survive. There are enemy\u0027s like creepers and spider but there are also zombies and skeletons which can only spawn at night. That\u0027s the basics. And then there is also Creative where you cant die and you have infinite everything where you can make whatever you want to your hearts content without worrying about dying or enemy\u0027s (or mobs as they call them). They are both fun game modes but that\u0027s not all. There are also chances to play with friends either on the same console or online, plus there are things called servers that were made by people so that you can play minigames or other activities that they have designed. The graphics are a good call back to the 8-Bit graphics of the NES, and the gameplay is smooth and the controls are even better with them being simple to use and understand. Overall if your looking for a fun sometimes family friendly game then this perfect for you. There is no wonder why its one of the best selling games of all time… ",

The survival mode is where you have limited resources around the map and must go and mine, craft dig and shovel, etc and if you have enabled “easy, medium, hard” you must fight monsters that try to go near you. The creative mode, in which I like more is the easy version where you do not have to worry about these things and can do whatever you want in the game like building a farm or a castle! The hardcore mode of the game is where things get really difficult, because once you die, your world gets deleted and you have no chance of respawning. There are also mini games on the Wii U, Xbox, and PS4 versions of the game called Tumble, Battle and Glide. Tumble is a free game which is basically spleef, where you use shovels and snowballs to make players fall off the platform. The last standing person wins. Battle is basically like hunger games, just with less players and smaller map size. Depending on how many players are in the game, the maps will expand to fit that amount of players. You go find items such as swords and bows and use them to defend yourself from other players. Battle royals, last one standing wins. Glide Is by far the least fun, however it still can be really fun on your own. The glide mode requires a lot of practice and you use wings to glide and navigate your way around the map until you reach the finish line. There are boosters hidden around the map that allow you to take shortcuts or get that extra speed boost. With other players it is a race. You can customize your character in the form of skins(some you have to pay for on all versions) or create your own on the Pc or Pocket editions. Other players on the pc version can start servers where you can find other people and mini games. The most popular are Hypixel, Lifeboat, anything pvp related and much more.… ",

This game is a revolutionary sandbox game. This game is the inspiration for games like Fortnite. There are some problems like some glitches, but every game has them. I like the last two updates, especially Village and Pillage. I barely have considered a update bad unlike other games. Story is not there, but Minecraft does not need it, If you are into stories, I could see you not liking Minecraft. I like the Easter Eggs and references they make towards them and third party entertainment, like paintings and name tags. This game is literally the best at modding. Multiplayer has run dry a little since 1.13 if you have not tried this game give a chance, for an indie, it is phenomenal. It all depends on the person… ",

Моды с нашего сайта — вам помогут разнообразить процесс игры и его гемлей. Установите моды — вы сможете приискать что-то себе. Сами моды они меняют стиль игры или добавляют для вас что-то интересное. Благодаря этому вам нравится игра и вы стараетесь увлекаться ею большое, продолжительное время — разбирая постройки с друзьями:). Существует много вариаций и разнообразий в модах — список версий уж долго перечислять он всегда пополняется! Например сейчас хит — это версия 1.14 модов в майнкрафт. На каждую версию мода найдется свое дополнение — вы и ваши друзья, должны учитывать, определится какую версию вам нужно скачать! Наш майнкрафт сайт с модами — на нем можете легко найти то что вам нужно и установить это! Я уверяю вас — вы можете быть спокойны за свой телефон андроид, или айфон, даже с компьютером будет все в порядке, каждый файл-мод проверяется администрацией! Плагин-что это? Так подумает обычный человек, который за всю игру не играл с друзьями на других серверах. А вдруг играл, но он ведь даже его не заметил, ведь регистрируешься ты часто и зайдя на сервер ты по привычке и зарегистрировался, а ведь это тоже плагин. Только его устанавливают владельцы серверов, к которым можно подключиться без лицензии. Плагин-это дополнение устанавливаемое на серверную часть, и в отличие от мода, вам не требуется его устанавливать на свой пк и что-то настраивать. Очень часто, маленькие и незначительные моды можно перенести в плагине и не потребуется установка например - мод что добавляет нам надгробия, был перенесен на плагин и теперь вам не нужно перед игрой заходить и скачивать данный мод. Но есть и свои крупные нюансы например в моде вам будет показана красивая могила, а в плагине нельзя добавлять текстуры, а значит она будет состоять из сундука и внутри будут ваши вещи. Из этого делается вывод Plugin- полезная единица для дополнения мира, но направленная на практичность.… ",

These are some of the most revolutionary and best games in all of history. Minecraft\u0027s core mechanic is simple, you can build blocks and you can break them. Even with a mechanic so simple, the possibilities are nearly endless. There are two modes, survival and creative. Survival is a game mode where you have to build to survive the night, you have hunger and health to worry about, and your main goal is to defeat the Ender Dragon. But this isnt the only thing you can do. You can explore the seas for treasure, explore for rich temples, and even more! Survival is pretty fun but it takes alot of time to gather materials, You can also try creative mode. Creative allows you to do anything, build a giant castle, create unbeatable mobs, or blow up entire mountains! That not even a chunk of what you can do in creative mode. Minecraft is a masterpiece, no other game will ever come close to how revolutionary this game is. This game proved to the gaming industry that one simple mechanic can express the upmost creativity and imagination. This game is a must-play, and 100% worth your money. I would recommend grabbing some friends and starting a survival world (or realm) together.… ",

With limitless creativity to be brought into the game, challenging survival modes, and a booming community, a game like this should be what all other games aspire to be.",

Minecraft ha riscosso così tanto successo all\u0027epoca del suo lancio, e la riscuote tutt\u0027ora a ben 10 lunghi anni dal suo rilascio, grazie all\u0027infinità, nel VERO senso della parola, di modi con i quali è possibile trasformare la propria esperienza di gioco, sia nella versione vanilla (Non modificata), sia tramite l\u0027ausilio di mod, plug in o custom maps. La fantasia del giocatore è messa alla prova: cerchi un luogo dove sprigionare le tue capacità ingegneristiche? Vuoi provare a mettere alla prova le tue capacità di sopravvivenza in un ambiente surrealmente ostile la notte quanto apparentemente infantile durante il giorno? Vuoi allenare le tue skill di combattimento all\u0027arma bianca virtuale senza il bisogno di sfoggiare complicate combo? Vuoi semplicemente fare esplodere dei maiali in un laboratorio ignifugo sottoterra? Accomodati pure. Markus Persson ti ha preceduto. Un altro punto a favore, fra i tanti, di Minecraft è la gestione che Microsoft ha esercitato dopo l\u0027acquisizione del brand. Invece di abbandonare il progetto e semplicemente intascare i ricavati di un prodotto non suo, lasciandolo al suo destino, la multinazionale si è presa l\u0027effettivo carico di proseguire il progetto adoperando risorse non indifferenti, portando sempre qualcosa di nuovo ai fedeli videogiocatori, con patch consistenti ed innovative (Anche se, personalmente, non ho apprezzato molto la 1.14, ma questo è un parere strettamente personale). E la community, a sua volta, ha dimostrato agli sviluppatori il loro sostegno aumentando le possibilità ludiche del gioco tramite mod e creazione di minigames online...

La seule limite finalement dans ce jeu, c\u0027est la créativité du joueur, ce qui fait véritablement sa force, sans compter sur le fait que Minecraft est extrêmement complet, et peut se vanter, plusieurs années après sa sortie, avoir une communauté énorme et active, notamment au vu des mods qu\u0027il est possible d\u0027ajouter, et qui enrichi toujours un peu plus l’expérience, bien que le vanilla soit déjà bien croustillant. Il est vrai qu\u0027il y en a pour tous les goûts, que ce soit la construction, les systèmes de redstone, l\u0027élevage, la culture de nourriture, l\u0027exploration et j\u0027en passe, le joueur a de quoi toujours s\u0027occuper, que ce soit en solo ou sur l\u0027un des nombreux serveurs existants. Si graphiquement le jeu peu paraître repoussant au premier abord, par son côté cubique et visuellement « dépassé », on apprend pourtant à s’émerveiller devant certains décors générés de manière procédurale. Par ailleurs, bon nombre de shader sont disponibles pour améliorer grandement les graphismes, à condition d\u0027avoir une configuration qui le supporte. Minecraft reste aujourd’hui une valeur sûre du jeu vidéo.… ",

Sin embargo, el hecho de que una vez sobreviví mas en dificultad hardcore que en fácil demuestran que las opciones de dificultad están muy mal hechas. Este juego es muy difícil. Sumado a la falta de tutorial, hacen que este juego no logre atraer nuevos jugadores. Sumémosle el pésimo rendimiento en algunas computadoras, la falta de mapa al principio del juego, y las pseudo mecánicas de RPG que creo que debieron de haberse aprovechado mejor. Es bastante frustrante también el full loot de este juego, es decir, ¿Inclusive si estoy jugando en fácil solo por toparme con un Creeper o minar para abajo me muero de una y pierdo todos mis items? Que mierda! Debería ser opcional! Muchas veces me tocaron mapas sin algún item importante como mapas sin ovejas ni vacas. Si pasa eso, estas jodido. El juego no tiene objetivos ni una explicación y lo único que lo salva es la exploración mediocre que tiene por las \"mediocres\" mecánicas jugables. El control de salto es malo y la dificultad con la falta de un tutorial para craftear lo mata. Necesitaría también un bestiario y algo para ver los items ya hechos o algo por el estilo. También critico el hecho de que las versiones de consola son superiores a la versión de PC, teniendo por ejemplo un multijugador a pantalla partida. De verdad que este juego podría haber sido muy divertido! Tiene un gran potencial! Pero las cagadas que se mandaron son muchas y graves. Pudo haber tenido mas nota, como también menos. Son opiniones personales. De todas formas, tiene un 5. Tiene puntos positivos y fuertes! No es un mal videojuego. Minecraft es muy disfrutable. Puedo recomendarlo? Claro que si! Tendrá un 5, pero hay gente que disfrutara el modo creativo, la exploración y una profundidad en la jugabilidad, única de este juego :)… ",

This isn\u0027t necessarily a bad game in the sense that I still DO play it today; I just don\u0027t often like how it works (and that\u0027s mainly why I\u0027m giving it that low a score) - the argument you can build anything you imagine is only half true in this game as for my argument. This only applies to form, never to function, in the most technical sense. For example, you\u0027d be hard-pressed to build a working excavator, at least not a life-like one, in Minecraft - it\u0027s impossible due to how the game works! On a less obvious note, a castle wouldn\u0027t be of much use, at least not in the traditional sense. This is because there\u0027s none of the traditional factors of a castle: people to work in it and protect it, a king to rule it, enemies to attack it, and soldiers to guard it. The lack of dynamics and such in the game\u0027s mechanics (including redstone) is arguably the game\u0027s weakest point - and definitely my biggest gripe with the game - in a game where you\u0027re expected to be able to build anything you can imagine. Some players actually view this as a game, and it falls short on satisfying that sector of gamers. The community is also a mess, and that is in fact how I became a negative person at one point. Obviously, I brought this on myself in the end ultimately, but I could still hardly blame myself if I became this way due to the community. It often spoke about doom and gloom, not to mention trolls, and this was especially so in the dark ages of Minecraft, back in 2014 - 2018(?). I shouldn\u0027t even have to mention that if you found today\u0027s micro-transactions more of genuine scams and less of game features, I would argue that the problem is 10x worse on Minecraft servers - where the rules are often twisted to prevent you from ever standing a chance in minigames, concurring a situation where you have two choices - where you either have to live with it, or pay up, meaning that you often have to pay to even enjoy the minigames, let alone succeed in it. Overall, the game had a lot of potential, but I feel was marred by Mojang\u0027s haphazard direction on the game itself and the lack of concern for ever providing a solid goal and point in the game, not to mention Minecraft servers that are arguably 10x worse than traditional pay-to-win mobile games, which I bet Mojang never really took into consideration as well. Now, again, this is certainly not to say that I\u0027ll won\u0027t be playing Minecraft - in fact, I still do enjoy the game to an extent. I just feel like things could\u0027ve been done a whole lot better for this game, and in a world where we expect the latest and greatest today, we\u0027re not seeing any of that advancement with Minecraft, really. If you\u0027re wondering why you get bored of worlds in Minecraft and start new ones instead of spending months much less years on worlds, this should be enough information for you. Pret-ty disappointing, if you ask me. If only Mojang were \"Craft-y\" to begin with. In fact, this game and its flaws and current flaws especially, are the impetus for a MC mod I\u0027ve been working on that plans to not only bring dynamics to this game, but provide a meaningful point and viewpoint to this game, among other things that should make Minecraft tick all the boxes it needs to. I\u0027m putting all my hope into the success of this mod, and hopefully it will provide y\u0027all all the stuff y\u0027all ever wanted and needed in this game. Cheers.… ",

Like playing an MMO offline.. the moment you ask for more and turn off creative mode, you are reminded that there isnt.. in fact.. a game to play. Just a creative mode that turns off creativity with its very existence. Creative mode - excellent, you have already spent hours upon hours building your masterpieces. Even the worst dig you ever did was amazing. You can enjoy every cave. Every formation, every landscape can be turned into something it isnt. Or something more. Or less. Dont like that mountain? Get rid of it. Mountain not high enough? Build it to the sky. Survival mode : ... there isnt any survival to speak of. Hunger meter in a game where there is no varied food items, but you can cook cow and pig all day long and.. it is too simple. Combat: atrocious. Your enemies have infinite ammo and no reason to hunt you. Animals attack suicidally. Skeleton archers pursue you to hell and back because... nothing. Creepers spawn when you sit still and improve your home. Or dig and make a tunnel safe and well lit. Believabiliy: None. There is no motif to the enemies. Just a hodgepodge of garbage. Unique biomes are nice, but never expanded upon with unique enemies or unique formations.. You have had YEARS TO ACTUALLY FIND A MOTIF TO BUILD UPON! So all in all, Minecraft is a zero. The mod community made the game, not the developers. Mods make a game, and this one is like a cult classic.. the movie sucks but the audience can collectively point fingers at your steaming pile of crap and laugh as a group.. so much like being sent away to an awful place, it isnt the destination but the people you go with that are the 10/10. Go die, Mojang. Lets Play\u0027ers on youtube made you.… ",

On the PS version, you can play a game mode similar to online mode except you can only play with the players on the same screen. Speaking of the same screen Minecraft is a 4 player game. Every time a person joins the screen splits. You can do different modes such as Creative, survival, and online mode.

Mesmo tendo uma fanbase realmente podre, ainda assim é um jogo muito bom e bem explorado. Com objetivos legais, um mapa divertido e uma mecânica com um texto muito bem escrito e dirigido. Por mais que o gráfico seja horrendo, isso não me incomodou, inclusive eu acho que a ideia era fazer um gráfico desta maneira e resultar num jogo bom, tipo Undertale, mas isso é outro assunto... de qualquer forma, eu gostei do game, mesmo sendo maçante, repetitivo, gráficos péssimos, cenários simples e mal abordados, ele ainda é divertido, e isso é o que importa.… ",
