AfterSo I bought this after playing and loving Simcity 3000 and Simcity 4, enjoying Simcity 4 even today, 10 years after its original release. I was hesitant about buying this, but the Glassbox engine and a few gameplay mechanic improvements were enough to make me plop down the $60 entry fee. Whoops, Origin is required, and you are always required to be online while playing the game. After waiting a good 40 minutes for EA\u0027s servers to let me into a single player game, I started playing a bit. Except my internet dropped out for a few minutes without my knowing until the game kicked me out for being offline. To EA\u0027s credit, it didn\u0027t make me lose my save, much. I still lost about 10 minutes of progress. Okay, so second try. I spent another hour logging in because the servers were getting pounded again. I decide to jump into the deep end by making the biggest city size they had available. I had to check two times to make sure that it was the biggest city size, because it was absolutely tiny. SC3KU\u0027s medium size was a bit bigger than this. So that\u0027s an actual city with suburbs gone out the window, and I resigned myself to making towns and nothing more. So when playing, I noticed another thing. Power and water mechanics are vastly simplified. Not streamlined, simplified. Of the vein \"make a few buildings at the town edge and forget about it\" sense, easily funded by pitiful money management. You can\u0027t even make water pipes or power lines anymore, removing any of the challenge in getting that infrastructure up. Sewage would be a neat addition too, but it\u0027s still largely useless. Then comes the zoning, where you zone different densities by... making different road sizes. You absolutely cannot have high-density buildings touching streets, so you have to build avenues all over the place to get high density buildings, largely unutilized since the \"individually simulated\" citizens love to funnel into a single avenue regardless of just how gridded your city is. In addition, industry and commercial buildings all have childish, enormous, uncreative names plastered on billboards seen from space. It was a bit charming at first, but seeing your entire industrial core covered in \"DIRTY INDUSTRY\" billboards gets old fast. The difficulty itself is awful. I could easily get a full-sized city up and running within an hour or two, never once going into the red. Monetary concerns are gone out the window unless an infrequent and easily-managed disaster strikes, and the only difficulty in this game has to do with somehow utilizing all of your meager amounts of land. Which leads me to another thing. Yes, roads can be curved now, but lots still follow rectangular grids. There is tons of technology these days that allows for curved and unequal lots, including in competitors like Synekism, Introversion\u0027s city generator, or even Shamus Young\u0027s city generator. However, since EA is still somehow stuck in the past, any curved roads end up wasting massive amounts of space due to lots always being rectangular. Areas inscribed by curved roads end up wasting up to around two thirds of their area. Even when you\u0027re not using curved roads, it seems the snap-to-right-angles option always wastes space due to a lack of visible grid, but the in-game adherence to a grid system. It wastes a bunch of space in the areas next to lots. This is horrible when your city size is already at a minimum. Finally, we come to the entire region view and multiplayer aspect of the game. The region system as set up is extremely visually jarring. There is a lot of wasted space and it results in two massive high-density cities being next door to each other but having absolutely no connections to each other aside from a meager, meandering highway. Then you have the myriad of idiots who just build cities in the shape of phalluses, ruining your experience anyways. Then, you\u0027re forced to play in a multiplayer region if you want the full experience of the singleplayer game, namely having all those imports and exports. However, all the cities next to you also move pollution to and fro. So there\u0027s always that guy who picks an upwind position and builds nothing but coal factories and industry, filling everyone else\u0027s cities with stifling pollution and preventing any meaningful progression. \"So just play with friends in your own region\" you say, well I\u0027m sorry to say that I\u0027m the only idiot dumb enough to buy this awful game. This is not a SimCity game in any sense except name only. This is just SimTown with awful design decisions and a clear plan to have loads of microtransactions. Save your money and don\u0027t buy this game until it hits the $5 bargain bin. Hope that EA doesn\u0027t shut down the servers by that time.… ",

These are all prime examples of games that were complete and utter blunders, had next to no innovation in just about any aspect of their game and yet reviewers gave them all extremely favourable reviews. It would almost lead someone to believe that EA/Activision are blackmailing Reviewers, or Buying them out, telling them they won\u0027t give them games pre-release or bribing them so they get a good review. Honestly if anyone ACTUALLY believes any kind of Big Gaming review websites these days, they\u0027re a complete moron. Now onto these same people trying to defend Always Online DRM, you can\u0027t defend it, PERIOD. It\u0027s a cheap and dirty practice that holds no place in the gaming world. What happens when you grab your Laptop and go somewhere that doesn\u0027t have internet access? What happens to the people with bad connections? What happens to your game when the servers crash? What happens when they do maintenance and you can\u0027t play for hours? What happens when the Cloud Saves glitch and you have to roll back your town (Which btw has already happened to people)? Honestly the problems with always online DRM is endless and serves no place in Gaming. Have a Singleplayer version of the game which can be accessed without Origin or can be accessed from a \"Origin Offline Mode (Where you don\u0027t need to log in Like you can do in Steam)\" and then have a Multiplayer version, then people get to choose which they prefer and you can do make changes to the different versions of the game without effecting the other. It\u0027s a disgusting practice by EA (And Blizzard for that matter with D3) and if you are enabling this kind of crap by buying these companies games then you are part of the Cancer that is slowly destroying gaming. I suppose I should talk about the game, well it doesn\u0027t come out till the 7th in Australia and I wasn\u0027t going to buy it anyway, I\u0027ve boycotted all EA Products. But there\u0027s streams going on and Videos all over the net showcasing the gameplay (In great detail mind you since Press had the game for a solid week or so pre-release and made tons and tons of cities). And they all agree it\u0027s good, but not great. I only gave the game a 2 because morons are giving this 10 to try and counter-balance the 0\u0027s, and whilst I think the 0\u0027s are taking things a little to far, low scores have to be given to balance. Frankly with none of this always online rubbish, bigger build plots and less focus on Multiplayer, I\u0027d say this game could definitely be a Solid 7-8/10. In it\u0027s current state, but without Always Online DRM probably a 5/10 is an honest Score. But sadly with the Always online BS in place, I think the 3-4/10 mark is spot on where this game deserves to be.… ",

I am dishearted by the fact that a singleplayer game is not avalible to play unless you are always online. I like playing games on the go, and Simcity 4 is one of the games that I enjoy a lot when commuting or relaxing in the park. Also, I fear for the day that EA want to cash in on a new version of Simcity, and closes the Simcity 2013 servers efficiently deleting my creative work. 2. This is not Simcity, it\u0027s Sim neighborhood. You have no room to expand or create experimental designs, because the city area is so cramped together that you will struggle to stay afloat without utilizing the area most efficiently. There is no possibility to create a huge buzzing metropolis, or vast rural farm areas firstly the city plots are too small, but they are also spread apart with a green blanket separating the individual city sites. On top of this, the cities are perfectly squared, meaning that the borders between city and \"country side\" looks very unappealing from an aesthetic point of view. 3. Lastly, there is no possibility to save a game, try out a strategy, and load in case everything crashed and burned. Your city becomes very costly. Imagine it like playing World of Warcraft where you lose your gear if you die.It might give some different gameplay aspects, but it hinders free creative play. The cheat-mode \"sandbox\" mode might change that, since you can unlock everything and try out to your hearts content, but there is still no save/load function, meaning that the city I spent 3 hours to build up could be 3 hours wasted if I want to try out how disasters inflict the local fire fighters. All in all; this game has so much potential, but it is lost in the sea of terrible design ideas that changes the feel from the epic of simcity 4, towards the short story of farmville. I could manage the EA-enforced always online DRM, and I understand that multiplayer gaming is the buzz-word that makes investors wet their pants but removing the essential parts of what made simcity great is stupid. The ability to build cities that in size and stature looks like New York, Shanghai or Tokyo, the ability to try out different strategies with the same city, and see which pans out and the ability to still play this game in 20 years. All of this could be included in a proper sandbox mode, I hope it will be.… ",

After playing the game for even an hour you will start feeling very cramped and you will basically be left with the option to build inwards, that is tearing down and reconstructing existing plots. For me a bare minimum before I would concider actually giving money for this game would be four times the size but I would really prefer nine or more.

Besides this is standard industry stuff now.... Along with day one DLC. I\u0027m going to throw out a caveat here and say that day one DLC is just fine EXCEPT when it is an essential part of beating a game or gives an unfair advantage in competitive multiplayer. None of this DLC does that. Don\u0027t want it don\u0027t buy it. Feel like you should get it for free? Well there isn\u0027t any saving you then. As for shutting off the servers? EA won\u0027t shut down the servers so long as a vibrant online community still exists for the game. No they won\u0027t spend millions running servers for you and five friends but that\u0027s the reality of modern online gaming, it all has an expiry date. The gameplay mechanics are perfectly represented by the review sites. The smaller build sites are an optimization feature that keeps the game running better with good graphics and the more demanding simulation system on the less then perfect rigs people have out there. In return you get a nice mechanic as a trade off; namely cities can\u0027t have everything now, just like in the real world cities share resources due to space, population or money constraints. Hopefully bigger maps come eventually for those of us who can run them but I\u0027m happy now. Now this game isn\u0027t a 100 as a few earlier professional European review sites stated. Nothing is 100. But on the flip side saying the game is great but day on DLC and the required internet connection that is clearly advertised make it a zero? That\u0027s a tantrum. The games a solid nine. Play it for the mechanics. It\u0027s great. If you want buy the day one DLC but doubtless there will be a sale eventually, thats what I\u0027ll be waiting for. Origin is what Origin is. Turn it off when your done with it and it takes like no space. I agree it could be a 9.5 if it had an offline mode and bigger maps available at launch but this game has a solid chance of becoming a classic.… ",

Rather than building on old concepts and introducing new fun elements for the player to experience, Sim City waters down the gameplay of its predecessors under the guise of \"streamlined gameplay\", and introduces mandatory mechanics that require the player to either have the assistance of other players online, or to manage multiple cities as if the player was playing with others. Gameplay has been stripped down to the bare minimum, and city sizes have NEVER been smaller in a Sim City game. This leads to a fairly short few hours of tedious zoning(which has also been \"streamlined\" in such a way that the player is hardly even doing anything) and watching as you very quickly hit the strict city limits. Past this point the player can attempt to make their city more dense and profitable, but it only takes a couple of hours after reaching the city size limit to do this. As far as the single player goes, that\u0027s it. Every playthrough, every city, will be exactly the same. The one differentiating factor in this version of SimCity is that EA has managed to shoehorn in multiplayer mechanics to justify invasive DRM. So while you\u0027re building your city that will be nearly identical to every other player\u0027s and even your own subsequent cities, you can trade resources between other players in your \u0027region\u0027 and work towards a common goal of a grand work resting just outside of your city limits. Building this grand work is a very simple task, you need resources, you tell your city to siphon resources into the project, that\u0027s it. You\u0027re not actively doing anything at all to construct this project, you just click a button, and wait. Now here\u0027s the kicker about these multiplayer features, you MUST participate. Sim City will not start without an active internet connection, once you\u0027ve made it past that part it\u0027s very likely you\u0027ll be waiting in a rather long queue to be allowed access to the game. The player can start a region and set it to private, meaning only those invited or the players themselves can join the game and make a city. Effectively making it a single player experience, but the player still has to be connected to the internet to play for some unknown reason, as well as having to wait in the queue to access their single player experience. Fortunately due to the lack of variety in Sim City\u0027s content, I\u0027m relatively sure the queues won\u0027t last long. In summary, this is a poor quality cash-in from a company willing to do whatever it takes to squeeze a little bit more money out of a popular franchise. I give Sim City a 0 for the simple fact that while you may be able to have a minuscule amount of fun making your first City, you could very easily get an earlier installment in the series, and have more fun for longer, at a cheaper price, wherever you are regardless of whether there\u0027s a nearby internet connection, without having to wait in a queue a couple thousand people long. There is absolutely no value in owning this game.… ",

When I play SimCity I don\u0027t want to talk or interact with anyone, the door to my room is closed and unless something important comes up all I want to do is make my city look totally awesome. The people who play SimCity tend to range from kids to people not too far off my grandfathers age and quite honestly I don\u0027t think these two demographics particularly want or need to interact with each other. Out of all the games that exist that EA could have chosen to force an \u0027Always On DRM\u0027 I don\u0027t think you could have picked a worse game than SimCity. Focusing further on the demographic for a SimCity game, it would appear that EA and Maxis now just assume everybody owns a highspeed internet connection and a relatively powerful desktop computer. One of the dev\u0027s I believe had been quotes as saying they wanted to make a game that \u0027Could run on your dads pc\u0027. Well unless your dad likes to keep up to date with new processors, graphics cards and RAM I think this game will struggle with your every day family PC. As for having an internet connection, I\u0027m sure the developers of a game called \u0027SimCity\u0027 must have come across a thing called a \u0027Village\u0027 or even a \u0027Small Town\u0027 because believe it or not some people who live in such places struggle to have an internet connection that will perform over 24 hours, let alone at a high speed. Moving on to gameplay however, yes, it is an entertaining game. Starting a new city is fun and you can easily get hooked for a few hours trying to manage your city and keep it both proftiable and expansive whilst maintaining your sim\u0027s happiness. Being able to choose different paths for your city is fun, going down the root of a Casino town, University town or Industrial town is a lot of fun and the process of achieving your goals is relatively smooth and cathartic. Then after two hours or so, you\u0027ve filled the map and you have to start all over again on a new plot. How am I expected to grow any emotional attachment to my cities If I can\u0027t spend hours upon hours building it up and overcoming obstacles to gain a real sense of achievement? How can I build a city to look unique and have areas such as poor districts for my labour workers, rich districts for my city slickers and the suburbs along long winding roads for the middle classes if I am forced to create a generic high density city grid structure across the entire area? That is not how cities look like! EA may decide to fix these problems with DLC, however quite honestly if I were to buy any DLC from EA it would feel like supplying semtex to the IRA. Everyone knows that EA are quite shameless in their ability to charge people money for DLC that could have quite easily already been in the game, or to charge people money for the right to cheat. Or to charge people money for items within the game, which destroys any form of difficulty curve. This puts many people in a worrying position. As someone who likes many of the games and franchises under EA, for example FIFA, Mass Effect, Dead Space etc. If I refused to buy any game release by EA on moral grounds then I would be missing out on quite a lot. However, everytime I purchase an EA game, their disgusting money grabbing antics continue to ruin the market. What I can say though is don\u0027t buy SimCity, unless you have the money to burn and don\u0027t mind playing something you will get bored of in just a few weeks.… ",

The game itself punishes you for playing alone, due to the fact that you are extremely limited to expand anything, giving the fact that you only get 2km x 2km to build at, while other Sim city games in the past had 10 times as much space. Because of this bizarre turn of event you are forced to build other cities connected to your city forms of transportation and design each and every city in a theme, in order to supply all sectors with water, jobs, transportation etc. Your town only regenerates income or resources when you load the city, you are being punished for playing alone, because your other cities connected to your prime city wont generate anything. You solve this issue by forcing your friends to purchase a license to the game and let them take control over your other districts, hence generating resources needed to run you main city. You know by now that the forced Online DRM will kick you if your internet stops working for a second, you will lose progress, money and buildings when the game kicks you and shuts the game down when your internet goes down.

Honestly if you pay for this, you are one of those people who do not mind being fooled by multi-billion-dollar corporations that exploit gamers. EA is ruining the gaming world with its actions. You can vote with your wallet! I only feel sorry for the developers who put a lot of work into their game just to be ruined by EA.… ",

The new casual focus is a failure, the scale is a failure, the online component is a failure, and the new art style is a failure. All good ideas on paper but EA just didn\u0027t quite manage to pull it off.

It truly is a game worthy of the name, unlike the SimCity Societies and various DS/Wii titles. I was wary of the online only thing when I first heard about it, but I think it was done very well and it is not some \u0027Facebook game\u0027 as others have said. The interactions between cities is nothing like the spam your friends nonsense and micro-transactions to build things of value. Everything is there to build fully functional cities and the interactions between the cities is amazing. The deals between neighbors are sweet that they use up the excess of power, water, water treatment, and other services to make money for one city and save the other one the cost of building the services. If the mayor selling services wants to they can increase capacity to make sure that the other city will have enough or they can shut down capacity and make the other mayor find a different way to meet their city\u0027s needs. Region play can be either open to the public or private with just friends or only by yourself. You can work together to make thriving cities and great works. The interactions between the cities is very nice and detailed and has been stated by the developers during interviews, lays the groundwork for even more amazing regions and larger cities in the future. Right now though, the game is balanced very well for meaningful decisions in each city that affect the surrounding region and the small city sizes seem to actually be more meaningful than just a large urban sprawl with everything possible built into it. Overall it has personality and charm between the names of the sims, houses, businesses, and factories and the general atmosphere and mood of the game. The music and visuals change as your city changes in amazing ways.… ",

Look and Feel: It looks really nice and watching the little sims doing their thing is amazing. It really feels like a living and breathing city. 4. The building part: The maps are just too small. Takes you around 1-2h to fill up the entire square and then you can either refine the city or move on to another one so don\u0027t expect to spend days or even weeks on a single city. If you have several cities in a region then they will work together but it is just not the same.

First of all, Maxis, well done. You\u0027ve created an interesting, fun and absorbing game, like you have done in the past. Secondly, EA Games, go bury yourself. The gameplay itself is nice and fun. But it\u0027s impossible to not notice the obvious parts that are missing, just so they can be added as DLC and sold for more profit later on. Subways for example and other means of transportation that could easily have made the \"final product\". Also, regarding this whole \"always online\" way of avoiding piracy, that does\u0027nt work so well does it. First of all, on launch day, the game is still unaccessable. Secondly, if you do create a nice city that you wish to continue playing, you\u0027re out of luck if your server is full. Either you\u0027re put into a queue, or you will have to start a new city on another server, putting your old favorite in the do-it-later-when-I\u0027m-allowed-to-play-what-I-want pile. Great. Also, Sim City is one of those perfect games to play when you just want to chill out and relax a little by yourself. The Sim City series have always been like that. Going away to your cabin for the weekend? Want a single-player game that ain\u0027t demanding, that you can just play for fun? Sim City has always delivered, along with other \"tycoon\" games. But now, thanks to the DRM, you always have to be online. So you can kiss those days goodbye as well. This could have been a great game worth spending hundreds of hours on. Thanks to the greed of the publisher, it\u0027s the complete opposite. Way to go there, ruining many players hopes of finally getting the best Sim City experience yet.

It\u0027s restrictive. It\u0027s maddening. You are only allowed to build your \"village\" within a very small, confined space, a square, with a dotted line around it. That\u0027s it. That\u0027s it! That, in and of itself, is enough to ruin the game for me. After an hour, you\u0027ve built a small village, and you\u0027re... done. You are done. You can tweak what you have, bulldoze some stuff, and... yeah. You\u0027re done. Now why did EA/Maxis do this? I can only speculate they are either really stupid, or really greedy. I expect in a few months they will start rolling out new content that you will have to pay for, e.g. $14.99 for \"medium\" sized maps (which will still be too small). The game really is a joke. The graphics are nice, but so are the graphics in Cities XL. I also wouldn\u0027t say they are that revolutionary. You might have seen the same product in 2009.… ",

The system is buggy (understatement) and it makes the gameplay (a lot) less enjoyable. I had high hopes for this game, but the launch sucked, and then the aftermath still sucks.

For the most part the game was fun and interesting, except there are some bugs like poor vehicle paths and unnecessary traffic congestion that can\u0027t be resolved without a patch from EA.. The major problem is that this game requires a constant connection to EA servers. Tonight I got home from work to play and I could not connect to the game in my region. Granted- all internet based games seem to have high traffic on launch. But this type of game shouldn\u0027t even require an online connection to play sandbox modes. Since I am not able to play in the the North American region, I decided to try the European regions. When I connected and started playing I was forced to play the tutorial (you cannot skip it) which was somehow bugged because the game puts me into the tutorial region but none of the menu\u0027s or actions are available. So not only can I NOT play the game offline in a sandbox style mode, but even when I connect, I am forced to play a tutorial scenario that is bugged to where I can\u0027t progress past and cannot be skipped. I truly enjoyed playing this game last night but these Online-DRMs NEED TO GO! Also there needs to be a way to skip the tutorial.. EA has published games long enough to know better than this. So far I am disappointed.… ",

I mean this game brings back memories I had as a kid! The fact that you can\u0027t just boot up the PC and play due to server issues is criminal. I give you $60 for something that I am expected to play whenever I want and you don\u0027t provide that? If you put the online-only concept aside, the game is still garbage. As I mentioned earlier, the game is empty and I am positive this is EA\u0027s attempt to steal more of our money through future bs add-ons. If you enjoy watching your computer defragment, then this is the game for you. DO NOT listen to these pathetic reviews from your typical, paid review writers (i.e, IGN and the others).… ",

The problem with it is not the game itself, but EA being a total dickbag. EA is very stupid. DRM on this game hurts the players so much more than pirating. When I first hear people talking about this game and the DRM problems. When I heard that the DRM was stupid, I thought back to Steam where I buy most of my games. On Steam you need to be logged in... and that is no problem because the servers are plentiful. This is why I was somewhat blind-sided by SimCity. I did not have to wait the first time playing. And the experience was great. But after about 2 hours, the server began to clog up. Now I understand some hiccups on launch day but it is sad when you cannot play because the server shuts down on you and kicks you off. Now to be honest. DRM only hurts the people who buy the game. I could probably go on ISOhunt or Piratebay right now and find a copy of the game that is working fine, but I like supporting the game devs.. MESSAGE TO ALL GAME CORPORATIONS!!!! DRM DOES NOT SOLVE ANYTHING!!! Now to sum up the game itself. I only played about 2 and a half hours, but what I did play was pretty great. I love the way cities can now have more organic themes with the new options like curvy roads and such. The game is fairly easy to grasp from the beginning and the controls are smooth. The only problem I had with the game itself is the maps feel a little small, meaning that your cities will become hard to control with so little space. My scoring: 10 -0.5 for the small maps -0.5 for removing subways -2 for the DRM that ruined the experience \u003d7/10 Final notes- This game could have been an 8 or 9 but the DRM caused the servers to crash... disallowing me to play the game. also, you guys should stop giving this game a 0 for DRM... honestly that is ridiculous. I know DRM is bad and some may not be able to play the game but in my opinion, you should wait a day and play the game instead of giving it a zero. It is not the game that is terrible, it is EA and Origin that are ruining it.… ",

The way it simulates resource distribution and things like using \"agents\" for everything is silly as it could be done in a less intensive way. Similarly, simulating every single person, while a cool idea on paper, is actually kind of pointless in a city builder and is more akin to a Sims expansion pack. So what you get is an overly complex simulation to create realism, yet the irony that square little cities with only one road connection to the outside world and surrounded by green wasteland, is totally unrealistic. How can you immerse yourself in the game when you know that you\u0027re playing a city building game where it\u0027s not possible to build a city? Thinking about the amazing regions I created on SC4, this is such a huge step backwards, and for what? 3D graphics and tiny maps. Other gripes include; -City tile size means you need efficiency, making the introduction of curvy roads a damp squib. -Always online; I live in a village with poor internet, thanks for thinking about us EA. -Lack of mixed zoning. -Density now decided by road type, and not seeing the full plot area when zoning. -Can no longer save cities. -No adjacent tiles which made SC4 a truly epic game in scale. -Graphics are ok, but given the massive trade-off with the tiny tiles you\u0027d think they\u0027d be better than \"ok\".… ",

It is a game all to itself and should be rated as such. Always on online DRM thingy...yeah...ummm I am not sure what the problem is. I think some folks are just a little too paranoid. Who plays computer games and is not always online???? I say kudos to Maxis and EA for taking an interest in supporting their product on a regular basis. Now to the actual game. Beautiful. Detailed. Easy to play. Complicated choices. Choices that actually mean something to your sims and the city you are attempting to sculpt. The learning curve is not terribly steep, but figuring out how to manage things gives you a real sense of the stresses of being in city government. I loved Sim City 2000. I adored Sim City 4. I am enamored with Sim City. There is so much to do in one single city. I am not extremely concerned with the map size (the only reason this review is not a 10) because I haven\u0027t even been able to perfect my gameplay in a small singular city. I can\u0027t destroy my city and start over...boooohoooooo! This is forcing me to actually play the game. I have to figure out the mistakes I make. I can\u0027t just delete the city and start over fresh. I have to figure things out. Sounds kind of realistic to me...something like a realistic sim...hmmmm...Sim City! I have not spent much time in the multiplayer universe yet. I am more of a solo player and guess what that is what I have been doing all day. Solo play. So stop crabbing about the multiplayer aspect! I cannot express it enough for fans of Sim City 2000 and Sim City 4...get your hands on this and play it for what it is. It does not claim to be either of those two games. It stands on its own and it stands tall. When you have the smallest detail such as: the moving trucks that move your Sims in have spelled out on them 6AM you know it has to be a great game...a great Sim City game. Good work Maxis!

Either way completely disregard what all these other reviewers say as the game is quite refreshing, it\u0027s been 10 years since the last one and it couldn\u0027t come any sooner. They also added a lot more and fixed many things from the previous games, like the road placement. The glassbox engine is neat, very little flaws and neat as you can see and interact with all the sims in the game. One of the biggest complaint is the server itself, i can almost guarantee if the publisher see\u0027s heavy log on rates they are just bound to increase it. The maps are indeed small but that\u0027s nothing to complain about as they have already promised bigger maps, and they will likely be free to heal the wounds of these hurt fanboys. So far it plays nicely and there are plenty of things to be done as well, lots of fun i might add. The save feature is lacked but have patience everyone. And most importantly, the internet itself. We live in a day and age where we could walk up and down the street and connect to at least 15 different wifi networks, password protected or not. Origin indeed sucks but ive gotten used to it at this point and frankly its not that bad, but when you put it up to heavyweights like Steam which have a crazy amount of innovative tools it\u0027s nothing.

This could be a great game but we in the community have been forced by EA to think about the fact that buying this game is supporting a direction in anti-piracy that absolutely harms the paying customer. As gamers, we have to put a stop to this Paying customers are getting screwed over by companies like EA in an attempt to curb piracy, but it\u0027s not working, and EA executives refuse to accept this reality. Instead, they continue to wrap the games their developers create with terrible, often-times game-breaking DRM (as many owners of this game have already reported), with absolutely no concern for their actual customers and what they want. As of this moment I am so appalled by how far EA is willing to go to fight piracy, that I\u0027m leaning towards never buying another EA game until they show some kind of wisdom and understanding of the reality of gaming as it is today. Piracy exists and it will always exist. The one thing that will never change is that good games that treat it\u0027s customers with respect will sell and make the producers a lot of money. This is what EA needs to do, stop fiddling with game-breaking DRM and just produce the games that we want to buy and play.

So as the term suggests, always-online-DRM means there is NO offline single player for this game. Want to play a single player world? Cool, you can do that, just sign into our servers first. Don\u0027t have internet? Need to pass the time on an airplane? Just play SimCity- oh wait, you can\u0027t. Ok, surely it can\u0027t be THAT big a deal, right? Wrong, not when you learn that you can\u0027t even save your worlds to your own hard drive. Everything you do has to be stored in EA\u0027s collection of poorly sustained servers. This also removes some of the magic of the old SimCity games, since it restricts you from destroying a city and reloading from an old save. This DRM system is restricting pretty basic freedoms of gaming. So there\u0027s the DRM system, which is a dealbreaker in itself, but what about the gameplay? Good news, that\u0027s a dealbreaker too. The cities are extremely small, you have no control over regional transport, there are no subways, and there is no terraforming. This game is completely misleading. This version of SimCity does not qualify as a full fledged video game. It qualifies as a Facebook game, at best.

You jump in the car and turn the key to fire up the massive V8 engine. Instead of satisfying roars, the dashboard flashes at you. \"Gas Pump not connected. Aborting.\" This sums up my experience so far with SimCity. I bought a new game to sit indefinitely in a queue that says, \"ATTEMPTING to reconnect in 20 minutes\". In other words, not persistent. No idea how long the queue is, just that it will try again in 20 minutes. Nice, right? In game, the tutorial, which you must complete, is broken. Buttons get greyed out. Random crashes happen, your SERVER-BASED saves don\u0027t sync and are deleted. Hours of gameplay down the drain. The only question on my mind now is, how long until the pull the login server plug and my $60 game becomes a $60 Frisbee? In fact, take your $60, walk up to a musclehead, and hand it to him. Ask him to punch you in the face. Not only will you get more for your money, but it will be less painful to watch. PASS.… ",

Only 2 US servers (5 total) 3. 0 customer service response or presence (255+ minute wait time to speak to an online rep, suddenly removed phone and email support access) The combination of these things has resulted in a horrible release for EA. Can I say I\u0027m surprised: no, not really. We, as consumers have allowed this behavior, and even excuse it with: It\u0027s release day, just wait... Every game has these problems at start... No one can expect the server load... and various other excuse that gets tossed up on a forum complaining about the game. The fact is NOT every game has this problem, because not every game requires online access, not every game requires you to link up with a limited server farm, and not every game is released with almost zero customer service... sigh, now that\u0027s out of the way, my review of what (little) I\u0027ve gotten to play: The visuals of the game are wonderful. The city grows very organically, and is pleasing to watch. The detail used to express and track the individual Sims in your city as they go about their daily lives is a great feat and adds so much to the depth of simulation. Musical effects are fitting for the scene and don\u0027t draw attention to themselves, while adding just enough ambiance to fill out the effect. For those that have played previous SimCity games before, you will find some issues though. First and foremost to me is the limited size you have to build your city in. Due to the \"specialization\" that you are \"encouraged\" to use for each city, you are limited to what appears to be about 2 square kilometers for each city. These are not very large spaces, especially compared to some of the huge blocks of space you could use in SimCity 4. Secondly, you will find that things have been streamlined. This is not always a bad thing. Everything runs through streets (power, water, sewage), so you can layout utilities and transport all in one go, however this also feels like \"training wheels\" to experienced SimCity players. The snap-to guides are handy, but lack any sense of sizing for future development. How big of a zone do I need to have a sky scraper in a few years? I don\u0027t know, I guess I\u0027ll just put these roads wherever. Region interconnectivity is an interesting, but less than stellar additon. The ability to work with friends and assist them to start off by providing Goods or Services is nice, but really rather meaningless if you aren\u0027t specializing your city. Graphic glitches do exist, but aren\u0027t game-breaking (many times my buildings simply dissapear or roads become transparent). The biggest issues are server issues. Any time I have attempted to play I have had to sit and wait for atleast 30 minutes before being able to join a server (yes, I\u0027m sitting for the fifth time today as I write this). This wouldn\u0027t be too bad expect for frequent crashes and glitches on cities becoming no responsive that require restarting the game, and sitting the server que... again. Another frustraion comes from the division of the servers themselves. The most common response we (people seeking support from EA) have gotten is: \"Just join a server that isn\u0027t full\". That\u0027s all fine and good, except the city I just spent three hours on only exists on one server. When you go to a new server, you have to restart with the tutorial (something that you can\u0027t skip and is bugged out on some servers), and start all over. Also, you only have access to 10 regions at any one time. You can delete a region to free up space, but this is bugged and currently not releasing the save slot on some servers. The ability to have a private region is nice for those of us that really don\u0027t want someone creating a bunch of pollution in our areas, but makes the always online DRM rather oppressive. All told, the few hours of play time I have gotten have been enjoyable. It\u0027s nice to have a pretty SimCity to poke around with, and I look forward to experimenting with the city specialization and regional superprojects, however, I have spent as much time waiting for tech support and sitting in server lines as I have played in the last 24 hours since release, and that is unacceptable to me. Is this a great sequel to SimCity 4... sadly, no. Is it a good game, yes I\u0027d say it is. It is fun, a great time sink, and something that has been lacking in recent games, but as always Buyer Beware when it comes to EA and any other distributors that restricts your access to the game you purchased. My other major concern is future content being distributed as purchased DLC, server instability, or the fact that at any time EA could decide to shut down the SimCity servers and your $60 game is suddenly gone. Use your personal scales to decide if you want to play SimCity badly enough to support such bad business practices. If you do, the game itself isn\u0027t bad.… ",

However, I am not rating this game a 0 due to prejudice against EA (I actually used to be a huge fan of Maxis, the developer). I\u0027m giving this game a 0 for one major reason: If you do not have a 100% consistent internet connection, like me, then do not buy this game; it is rendered almost completely unplayable. You cannot save the game of your own accord, the EA servers decide when your game auto-saves, and there are not multiple save files. If you lose your connection to the EA servers and cannot recover it in 180 seconds, you are SOL. The game will boot you and, obviously, since you are not connected to the EA server, your game will not save. Compounding this issue (as of launch, servers probably won\u0027t be so busy a week from now), when you do try to reload the game, you are sent to the back of a queue, of which I have yet to see the end of (I\u0027ve been waiting almost 3 hours now), before you can get in the server (even if you just want to play \"single player\"). If you have absolutely no worries about the consistency of your internet provider, than you have a decent 7/10 game on your hands. For the total of maybe two hours I have gotten to play the game, I can say that I was genuinely enjoying myself. The game is very identical to Sim City 4, but the graphics are much better and it is quite fun to build a city in a region with up to 16 other people. It would easily be a 9/10 minus a few moderately annoying drawbacks: 1. You cannot save on your own, the EA server will auto-save for you. This took away one of the most stress-relieving elements of Sim City 4: Saving your perfect city before wrecking havoc on it\u0027s unsuspecting inhabitants with disaster after disaster, only to be able to reload the old save when the fun was over, good as new. 2. You cannot save on your own. Again. If you make a mistake, you\u0027re stuck with it. Accidentally jerk your mouse and place that $150,000 Nuclear Plant in the wrong place? Too bad. No refund, no reload. 3. There are a lot of glitches with creating private regions, and inviting friends to them. Five of my friends bought this game. Only me and one other have been able to play together so far. 4. The plots are very small. Do you know any cities in real life that are 2km x 2km? Me neither. I didn\u0027t even play for two hours and I was running out of room to put new schools. And God forbid you have a river running through the middle of your city there goes half your land area. So there you have it. SIM CITY: A decent creation by the developers, ruined by the producers.… ",

Ig you\u0027re lucky enought to be able to log in on the servers you probably still won\u0027t be able to create a city due to overload. Yes, it might get fixed later on but would you really want to play a game from a company that cares so little about the consumers that they don\u0027t even offer refunds? The limitations on the citys are a joke aswell, from being able to build whatever you want wherever you want you are now forced to build it all on a very small piece of land, way too small for a game who\u0027s supposed to be a city simulation. If I knew about all the issues with logins etc I would never have bought this game!… ",

Trading between regions is cool, as you can make a city and dedicate garbage, water, electrical, sewage, trading etc. Bigger maps are required and Iam happy. Always online but there is a lot more positive the bad in this game.… ",

That\u0027s right, the hotly contested decision of SimCity being an online game (needs to be connected to servers in order to play) ended up being a total disaster as so many people predicted. Forget the problems of not being to download the game on Origin when it launched, the big problem now is that the servers are way overtaxed; so much so that I\u0027ve been trying on and off every 10 minutes for the past 6 hours to log in with no luck. This fatal flaw is the only reason I have not rated this game at least a 9/10. The gameplay is a little different in that your city borders are smaller and you need to specialize your city and work with other cities in the region to run efficiently. Regions range from 2 city regions up to 16, and you can either decide to play it solo by claiming all the cities in a region for yourself or with others by allowing others to join the region and create their own cities. I admit, however, that it is rather difficult managing more that 2 or 3 cities in a region and although possible, this is not how Maxis intended for you to play the game. It\u0027s also noteworthy that Maxis has stated that they will increase the city sizes \"eventually\" as this is one of the more common complaints among play testers and consumers. I won\u0027t give you a huge breakdown on how the gameplay works check out any professional review site and you\u0027ll get that. I will tell you that the game is crazy addictive and incredibly fun. Just wait until Maxis EA Origin work out the server issues (as they have promised to do) before you buy it.… ",

I play SOLO! Which means I shouldn\u0027t need to connect to the internet or try and log into full servers. The servers have been busy since launch! They even added another 4 servers (2 more for the U.S 2 more for Europe) but they all remain busy. To access these busy servers they place you in a queue which checks for availability every 20 mins! Who wants to wait 20 mins in queue to play a game in 2013? To make matters worse city saves don\u0027t transfer across all the different servers. So if you developed an entire \"region\" on the EAST USA 1 server it\u0027s restricted to that server. So having to jump onto another server means you have to start all over again. During gameplay if the server goes down, which has happened 8 times in 12H of game time played, then your progress isn\u0027t saved and you again have to start over. The maps are way to small. Weird glitches take place. Factories/casinos/schools all magically stop working causing massive crashes in population. I think they included the fluctuating population feature b/c of the small map size. Curved roads are useless. They waste space which is very crucial in this version. If you\u0027re willing to pay for a game that you will have limited access too, will constantly have to restart due to developer incompetence, get frustrated by illogical glitches then buy the game. I would recommend not buying this game. Spend 5$ on a Kairosoft game (Game dev story/mega mall story) you\u0027ll get more enjoyment and better performance from that game.… ",

I have to launch the game and use another proprietary updater? Once again I had to wait out a slow update speed, this time without even the benefit of knowing just how slow it was going. But whatever, it will only happen once....hopefully. Once I completed that patch, I was finally greeted with the server selection screen. I can play! NOPE! Unable to connect to the SimCity Servers. Please try again. I click Okay and a server is selected for me. I click the play button expecting to get in and start Mayoring it up. I watch the intro showing me all the cool things I will soon be building. The intro finishes and I eagerly click to select my region etc. NOPE! Server not available. Even though it specifically said it was. So now I have a screen without a functioning button except settings and quit. So at this point, I have spent $60 and some change to close the game, plop their software on my computer and wait for the incompetents at EA to get off their lazy butts and fix what should have been a known quantity. If you are going to force persistent online authentication, at least plan for multiple redundancy and overflow. Don\u0027t have a few small servers and then act surprised when they are overflowing in a few short minutes. That might have flown 10-15 years ago, but in this day and age it is totally unacceptable for a publishing studio to demonstrate this atrocious lack of planning/ To top it off, if you insist on acting like this was an unexpected event at least have the courtesy to maintain good communication with your customers. At the end of the day, they are the ones who are paying for this useless piece of garbage and if handled properly, may just stay once things settle down. If you do as EA is currently and release sporadic and uninformative propaganda instead, you are only pushing your already dissatisfied customers closer to abandoning the game before it even gets off the ground. To condense since most people don\u0027t have the attention span to read for very long here it is: Don\u0027t pretend this wasn\u0027t a foregone conclusion with the lack of preload, limited beta that didn\u0027t test anything and a gross underestimate of the hardware needed to support the game. As bad as it sounds, throw some of that money you have stashed in the back at the problem! Add hardware, add connections, whatever needs to be done to remedy the situation. After the explosion is not the time to worry about how much bandages might cost. Fix the problem and then figure out money later. Provide honest and consistent updates to your player base. Don\u0027t lie about what is and isn\u0027t being done, don\u0027t act like everything is working fine when your entire playerbase is telling you otherwise. The server are not online, no one can play. Constant updates until things are working again should be priority #2, right behind the actual problem resolution. Every 30 minutes to an hour until it\u0027s fixed. Not that hard, take a page from other companies.… ",

There are so many server issues right now its ridiculous. I know a lot of people are complaining about not being able to connect, which, yeah sure that\u0027s not good, but I am going to talk about something worse than not being able to connect. Losing mass amounts of time and progress because the game loses connection to server while playing. This in all honestly has to be the most frustrating thing to happen to me by far. I would much rather just not being able to connect than to lose half my city because EAs crap servers took a dump. Normally that wouldn\u0027t be much of a problem because you could just upload data from local storage to the cloud but guess what, this game has no local save feature. That\u0027s right, none at all. Whoever made that bonehead decision needs to be fired on the spot. I honestly have a ton of gripes about this newest iteration on one of my favorite franchises(been a sim gamer since Super Nintendo and original Sim City) but I don\u0027t want to spend all my time being negative. The only other negative thing I will say is that the city plot sizes are terrible. I didn\u0027t think that they would bother me that much but they do, a lot. Only a short while into my cities life and I have already used up half the real estate. This game forces you to cram everything in the most efficient spacing possible just to get to a decent sized city. It really takes the wind out of your sails when you realize your almost out of room and you have not gotten a tenth of the things you had planned in to the city. That said, this game has sooooo much potential. The infrastructure and groundwork have been laid out to deliver one of the best city simulations of all time there are just too many things wrong at the moment to waste your time on it. I am severely regretting buying this game. Has the time come to stop pre ordering games? I think so. To many bad decisions in game making over the past year or so has left me jaded towards developers and publishers. Im looking at you Blizzard, Bioware, EA and Maxis. You all know better but we keep taking the crap you are shoveling and asking for more so why would you ever stop? Nah, not gonna happen until we, the consumers, start speaking with our wallets. I for one WILL start speaking with my wallet from now on. No more good faith purchases for this video game nerd.… ",

A company who was created by a brilliant programmer Will Wright (which to be honest I look up to and hope to one day achieve something great like him.) However after downloading the game and unable to play after 8 or so hours after I paid $80 (in support to Maxis) I am still unable to create one single city. Its either server are down, unable to login to server please login again, and unable to claim city (this was earlier in the day.) This is a horrendous experience for any customer. How does a large company such as yourself able to pour so much money into marketing a game yet unable to provide the support or infrastructure it needs for it to work? Its like Lamborghini made a new car and once they give you the key you can\u0027t drive it anywhere. How worthless is that to the buyer? Anyways, to go on with what I want to say, you have my $80.00 keep it for your unemployment checks once people are finally fed up with your B.S. I hope every single one of your executives that have had any say in pushing this product out, loose their job, loose their wealth, and have to go live in a homeless shelter. Maybe then that they would learn how to earn a respectable living before falsifying a product and shamelessly using a dearly beloved brand name to fill their pockets first. Also I\u0027m probably no longer going to wait for EA to fix this crap. I\u0027ll wait for one of the hacker groups out there who are only a team of 10 or so or less able to throw in some codes to make it work offline. Seriously a group of hackers can make this game offline and a GIANT Fing company can\u0027t make a mode for offline gaming. P.S. If there was an offline gaming, there wouldn\u0027t be this rant, SimCity was an offline game. You want online fine, make it an option not a NECCESSARY! P.S.S. Comments on hackers, I really hope EA reads it and learn that hackers are going to be this brand savior instead of the opposite. We(consumers) buy legitimate games that we can\u0027t play(because of the company foolishness) but if they(pirates) get it illegitimately they will be able to play it...that is one @SS backward way to sell your games! All I can say is I root for the pirates this time all the way!… ",

They are most likely going to try to sell larger city areas in the future as DLC. Overall, I cannot recommend any one buying this game.

Most people can\u0027t even get to the server selection. I know a lot of people keep saying \"but its the servers, not the actual game\"; well WAKE UP... the Servers are NEEDED for proper game play.

Good luck to any players that still want to play the game. I\u0027m getting my money back. Sorry that was my rant on not being able to play. Sim City 5 is also dumb down. You have no control on piping(Water, Sewage, or Strom drains) You don\u0027t have to put up electrical poles. Everything is base on roads, they lay down everything under the roads (Which I do anyways in sim city 4). The maps are very small very very small. I understand you get to play with other players, but why Do I have to rely on someone else to build something I can\u0027t fit in my city. Oh also I forgot you can lay down tracks, or highways. Server side saving, I lost a lot of cities from this... I might be missing stuff here, but you get the picture. I did love that you can set your city to specialize in mining, oil, trade, tourism, and/or casinos. the road designs are really good as well, straight, cruve, square, and wave roads. The building design for the medium to high wealth sims are cool looking. You can upgrade some of the utility buildings. Addons like more buses, more rooms for clincs… ",

I wanted this game because of the promise that single player would work, and it just doesn\u0027t. Specializing cities is clunky and poorly implemented. The process of sharing services and goods between cities is convoluted and nonsense.

I loved what I\u0027ve seen so far not much, but the game \"felt\" great, smooth, beautifull and I was already developing some emotional ties to my little town. After 40 minutes, I decided to quit and restart the game because I was suspicious. I was fearing that the game wouldn\u0027t save my city. I wanted to find out. While quitting Simcity, a message popped up, saying something about synchronization issues (I couldn\u0027t read it because the game was already quitting). So I strongly believe that my city has not been saved. I then tried to reenter the game, which now tells me that I have to wait in queque for 3 hours and 20 minutes. It\u0027s a real shame for whoever is responsible for that, and I\u0027m honestly glad that many customers demand a refund to show their protest. I myself, however, strongly assume that the issues will be fixed in a few days. And as I like what I\u0027ve seen of the real game so far was nice, I don\u0027t belong to the courageous ones who demand a refund. The US release seems to have been a horrible debacle. I can\u0027t quite understand how there can be such a huge miscalculation. I mean there have been betas and stresstests. And even then, there must be the option to put up some more servers until the release-peak abades? It indeed reminds a bit of a restaurant that has a tiny kitchen but 100 tables, resulting in waiting times of hours and days. That\u0027s ridiculous and absolutely inexcusable. And it\u0027s not about whining and fanboyism. I have no problem with waiting a few more days until someone finds out that one cook might not suffice to service 100 tables. But it\u0027s about principles. Not to INSTANTLY solve such huge and perfectly foreseeable issues, with angry customers flooding the boards, should be an absolute no-go and deserves to be sanctioned in every conceivable and legal way. And then they even have the insolance to predict a flawless launch for Europe with two servers. Really. I\u0027m also glad that negative reviews are being posted, although it\u0027s of course not fair to the game itself (which is reviewed in the \"professional\" reviews). And unfortunately, boycotting is not an easy task for a gamer because I think that there is still a lack of competition. How many recent and decent city building games are out there? Within its niche (and indeed I\u0027d call game genres niches), simcity has the monopoly. And this apparently makes those who are responsible for the launch-debacles act like monopolists. Therefore I\u0027m thankfull for everyone who demands a refund. I\u0027m not consequent enough for this myself and bend to the sweet lures and the carrot-and-stick tactics that EA seems to expect fans to put up with. I really feel sorry for people who got excited about what seems to be a great game and who were looking forward to it and supported it to be let down like this. It\u0027s really such an unneccessary dark shadow over this game. All the rage of negative user reviews shows how much they\u0027ve been looking forward to this game and how much they\u0027ve been disappointed by such a horrible launch. So I strongly suggest not to buy the game yet, as it is unplayable. All you will get to see is a waiting queue (that lies anyway once time runs out, you\u0027ll be informed that there are server issues), or the information that you can\u0027t claim this city now because of server problems. If anyone thinks that server issues and the game itself deserve seperate ratings: no, because you can only play this game online.… ",

Server troubles aside, Sim City certainly builds on it\u0027s predecessors with a chain of resources mechanic and the need to constantly manage these resources in an effort to balance tax revenue with revenue from business ventures, shipping ventures, gambling, and tourism. While these \u0027specializations\u0027 are limited they are certainly welcome to the series, almost fitting in as if they had been there all along. There\u0027s a familiar comfort in the interface, and ease of use for the new player (Water and electricity management run along roads rather than independent pipes and wires). While the omission of some micromanagement is a casualty among old players, the game more than makes up for it in it\u0027s continued focus on efficient resource management and space allocation. That being said, a number of bedbugs spoil the honeymoon; what should\u0027ve been a grand return to the forefront of simulation and management has instead become a slog through DRM sludge, connection issues, and just straight resistance from every force in the world, Heavenly or otherwise, to mayors playing the game. There was a day-one patch, a day-two patch, a bug where clients would be stuck downloading nonexistent updates, \u0027ghost servers\u0027 (Where you could connect to a server just to be kicked off for a \u0027network issue\u0027, a \u0027connection issue\u0027, or because the server was never up in the first place). I, personally, have been unable to play the game from two different residences with stable internet connections for more than ten minutes each on day two. Apparently I have logged in six hours, but I highly dispute that number (Or Origin counts the amount of time I spend cursing at Sim City as playtime). I hope for nothing more than resolution; I would prefer to have a working Sim City game on my computer than 60+ dollars of Origin credit. Server issues aside, gameplay does suffer some setbacks. As mentioned earlier, power and water hookups are stunted, pared down to where the roads run. City size is stunted as well, with plans in the works to offer increased sizes later down the line with new regions. Because of the smaller size, it is very difficult to build and manage a city yourself, even a region under your control is difficult to manage (Given that cities pause when you leave them; freight and raw materials don\u0027t move unless you\u0027re working the city that ships them out). I\u0027d hate to add speculation to this review, but I wouldn\u0027t put it beside EA to offer regions with increased city size as premium content, given the fact that they released what I would consider a near-finished game in beta. Coupled with so-heinous-it-ought-to-be-a-crime-against-humanity wait for Origin support, as well as Origin\u0027s resistance to doling out refunds to unsatisfied customers, Sim City might be the biggest disappointment to me since Stone Temple Pilots most recent self-titled release. It\u0027s as if I have been sold a Jackson Pollack painting with a clause that the seller may throw a sheet over the painting at any time they so choose. I would give the game an 8/10, but I am the professor and this is a very late assignment. And I hate late assignments.… ",

The \"cozy\" \"city\" you\u0027ll be building in will quickly turn into a parking lot no matter what configuration you put the roads in, or how many modes of mass transport you put in. Now if you can get over all of these gripes you will still be left asking why your garbage trucks look like they entered into the indy 500 and are circling the same block ad infinitum until their shift is over and they return to the dump, leaving one block kinda cleaned up and the rest of your city burning from uncollected garbage. Which brings us to the next point, Emergency services...the guys with the bright flashing lights and the loud (and in the game they might as well be the only sound in the game next to the sound of rc racers...I mean cars) sirens, they sit in traffic on a 6 lane avenue just like any car. There is no precedence for other cars to get out of the way or lights to change in their favor...they just sit there...so while your entire city burns because of garbage, your EMS/Fire will just be sitting in the station or in traffic jamming away to whatever is on the radio because they\u0027re going no where. Now if you can manage to get through all of this you are left with one last hurdle to making a stable game; Finances. You have essentially no room to build a proper industrial park or residential neighborhood, so you have to compromise., you add a dash of residential with a smattering of commercial and boom your RCI starts to beg for industrial and you think sweet! we\u0027re gunna get people jobs and they\u0027ll have lots of money and everything will be perfect! WRONG! you\u0027ll chase industrial demand until your city is completely covered, and if by some miracle you get it sort of under control they (industry) will start to scream and shut down due to lack of workers because your sims with all their new found wealth will start to expand and they\u0027ll magically disappear from your city until their building has been renovated, but by that time the factory will be shut down or on fire and they\u0027ll have no where to work, they\u0027ll go broke, and then they will turn into vagrants who will in turn cause crime and cause even more of your city to burn. Also city and education buildings cost so much they eat away all profit so the only way to gain enough capital to build anything is to twiddle your thumbs and hope everything stays sane or take out bonds which in the long run just screw you over Sooooo all in all the game gets a 3 from me, its easy to get sucked in and play for hours and hours but at the end of the session I\u0027m left angry and bitter. I\u0027ve built 7 cities and not a single one has been a fun relaxing experience.

The UI is well laid out (for a game that is about information overload, after all) and the data layers are cool. But in addition to all of the issues with DRM, the botched launch, and ongoing server issues (it\u0027s only Day Two, but c\u0027mon. I work in this field and I know EA/Origin could have planned better) the fact is that the game feels.....lacking. What do I mean? Well, there\u0027s that lovely data interface, and not a lot of actual depth to the data. You can\u0027t edit a Plopable (ugh.) once you\u0027ve already added things to it. There\u0027s no real sense for what supply and demand is like in the global market. The maps are small, and the whole forced boundary thing is maddening. All my cities end up looking un-naturally square. There is no terrain editing (one of the longtime favorite sub-categories of the older versions.) And most annoying to me there is no ability to save your game mid-play, and then \"alternate reality\" it which is something I\u0027ve done in EVERY SimCity, ever. SimCity is the game that taught me to save before key decision points....and now, nothing. Not even an option. I want to love this game....but it has a long way to go before it lives up to its promise, and that makes me, and the new gaming computer I built specifically for it.....very, very sad.… ",

Now if we look at the current 60 positive reviews, of the people giving these ratings the average of ratings given by each individual reviewer was 1.75, compared to the positives where the average number of rating per rater was (among the most recent 100) Was 4.33. Now why do you think this could be, I took a closer look and Of these 60 negative reviews 44 of them, 73%, of the raters had given exactly one review and one rating that is only for this one game. And of the remaining 16 people 9 of them had given only 2 reviews and 2 ratings. Leaving only 7 of the 60 raters with more than 2 rating and 2 reviews. People always say that the company will tell employees to rate their games highly or get people to do that for them, this is a little over the top.

They have done their fans, some of which got into gaming with the original SimCity, a massive disservice, and the poor designers of the game are left with their hardwork in pieces. SimCity has always been a single player experience. It was something that a kid used to be able to load up and get lost in their own imaginations. That magic is gone, forcing a mechanic no one wanted and worst of all, not even giving us a working version of the mechanics they\u0027re forcing us to use. Do yourself a favor, and stay away.

And a half. But let\u0027s track it back a bit, for the moment I thought of Buying Sim City. . The first time I\u0027ve played a SC was on my SNES. No, not the computer, but Nintendo Console, and it drag me in. I was fascinated with the idea of building my city in a way the game punish me for my mistakes by making the city drown in it\u0027s own failed concept. Loved it so much that bought SC 2000 to my PC. And the game had turned into an adult experience. I was a boy, but the game didn\u0027t care: If I think like a child, my city will fail. . So it came 3000, and it brought a even more complex and awesome face to the series. Sim City 4 got everything they\u0027ve done right in All Sim City and turned it into one of the best video-games ever! Then, years of gameplay in SC4 has passed and they announced SC, the reboot. I smiled and praise every god! Then they told me about the Always-on. I don\u0027t buy games with AO or DRM, but this is Sim City, man! So I decided to make an exception. And now totally regreted it. TOTALLY! . First of it all: It took me almost a day to download it. I was anxious. I wanted to play my game, \u0027cause I\u0027ve already bought it, Right? They shoud have given me more band. After the long wait, the game was FINALLY here. So LET\u0027S PLAY... not. The first hour (Yes, HOUR) I couldn\u0027t connect to the server. Then, almost like a miracle, I logged in. . \"Where are the Graphs?\", I asked myself. How can I Manage my city to total Awesomeness by seeing my development in curves to compare to other cities? Well, I can\u0027t. The game is officially dumbed down, with a crappy live economy that only exists to make you stay on-line. . \"Wait, I can\u0027t do ANYTHING with the terrain?\" No, I can\u0027t. I have to accept the map as it is. No big mountains. No great planning for a really awesome tunnel. . The map is really, really small! Smaller then I thought it was by looking at pictures. I made a road the crossed all the map and started planning my city. Some minutes passed and I\u0027ve tried to sell resources (electricity and water) to neighbour cities. For some reason I couldn\u0027t (still don\u0027t know, and the same is happening for many people). . And then things got worse: I was Diconnected! Yes, I\u0027ve played arround 40 minutes and somehow I couldn\u0027t play anymore. On the screen, they\u0027re telling me it will try to connect again in 20 minutes. TWENTY. F**KING. MINUTES. Clock reaches zero AND... Couldn\u0027t log in. AGAIN IN 20 MINUTES! WHAT THE F**K? I\u0027ve just bought the DAMN game and can\u0027t play it because YOUR servers are DOWN and this CRAPPY DRM won\u0027t let me even see my city? WTF, EA? . So I waited. And sometime later it connected again. And I\u0027m building my city. And it\u0027s growing. Despite the lack of administration tools with minimum complexity, I\u0027m getting richier. First I expanded North (the place I called North, anyway), and when I reached the border, started to expand south. And then I realized I had NO MORE ROOM TO BUILD! I\u0027ts Over, friends! Can\u0027t expand anymore! It Took me two and a half hours to ocuppy the WHOLE map! From this point on, if you wish to keep playing, it turns out you are in a SOCIAL THE SIMS, where you need to keep looking at the mood of sims to make them happy. No more Building, just a clown trying to make people smile! Want to play more? Try building another small boring city! . And that\u0027s how my love for Sim City is officially over. It was a good fun, but EA needed to cheat on me. And That\u0027s why, since I can\u0027t give this game back, I\u0027m giving it a zero on my first review on metacritics.… ",

Several times throughout the first beta, I was repeatedly kicked because the servers crashed. Furthermore, there was issues with the tutorials and the general interface. I had fun but I rated it roughly a 4 out of 10 because it had an always online-DRM and also it was buggy, but I saw potential. The second beta was only a day long, and EA dropped the ball and excluded several people that should have had access to the game. I only had access to it because I pre-ordered it from Amazon as opposed to Origin. (2) The Launch Day (0 out of 10) This is the most blatant bait-and-switch tactic I have ever seen and most definitely could be considered for legal action for equitable estoppel and unjust enrichment. The consumers had reasonable expectations of a service that would be delivered in a timely manner. Furthermore, EA made assurances that the game would be released on time and they took the necessary precautions regarding the server loads even at the behest of most customers and most industry warnings that online-only DRMs are very tricky to successfully do. They repeatedly stated that they would be releasing the game at 12:01 AM EST and that the servers could perform the task. The result was far from a 12:01 AM EST release. For the vast majority of customers the game was not available for download until well past 12:40 AM. I, myself, was not able to download the game until roughly 1:20 am CST (This is nearly an 2 hour and 20 minutes AFTER the official release time). Mind you this was AFTER tech support for their phone line was done for the business day, and their online service for tech support had nearly a 360 minute wait, and I recall only 2 official statements. One was from an EA representative telling people to restart their Origin client, the other was from TWITTER and NOT their official forum. The sheer LACK of information regarding the status, updates, and whether the game would be available for download was laughable, even more so considering that EA decided not allow pre-loading in the face of growing concerns by both customers and several industry writers. I was fortunate enough to play the game without the problems that other people faced, albeit I did have to switch the server from US East to US West and had a large patch to run through. I began playing roughly around 2:20 AM CST (a good solid 3 hours later). (3) Post-Launch (4 out of 10) The game has been very buggy. The region walls work only 1/2 of the time and if they do its nearly a 3-5 minute delay. The in-game chat interface is worthless. There is no notification of when someone speaks, therefore, it goes largely ignored. The global trade is a complete failure. I went from having nearly $1 million (\"$1M\") to only $120,000 because I was not getting income for my trades. Furthermore, there is no adjustment in the prices even after I FLOODED the market with my plastic supply when it did work. Currently, I am waiting for the game to finish its second round of patches in an attempt to fix the bugs in the game, involving the region wall, trade, and connectability issues. I will give credit where credit is due. EA is doing its best trying to fix the issue of the post-launch. They are opening new servers, trying to keep people informed via their forum, etc. (Much better than the launch-day blackout). I would say this is probably the most botched game-day release I\u0027ve seen however. I would consider Diablo III as a success in comparison, seeing as the volume of players was much larger for the latter. (4) Game Play (2 out of 10) The game is still buggy. I was able to literally build a zone underwater because the road tool drew the road underwater. The traffic simulation is horrible. How more roads equates to higher traffic congestion and thousands of Sims ignoring a clear 6 lane avenue a block away from the congested one makes no sense. The worst is the multiplayer feature. YOU CANNOT TURN OFF OTHER CITIES FROM LEECHING FROM YOU, which EA conveniently excluded. I built a 140k population city and the cities around me leeched power and water, while dumping their sewage into my sewage plants. I cannot choose to cut off their power or water nor choose to reject accepting their sewage and get a measly fee for it and have to use valuable space to keep up with their rising demand or my city suffers for inadequate services. I literally went from a booming hi-tech industry to the basic utility provider for my region without ANY way to stop it from happening. The neighboring cities then abandoned their cities leaving me with a dump and in debt… ",

I\u0027ve spent more time trying to play than actually playing. In trying to load one of my 4 Cities it reports that I cannot due to the servers being down. Maxis is a good developer, at least they were until they got gobbled-up by EA. I will certainly think twice before buying any additional EA titles in the future.

So I walked away from my computer for a while. I tried logging in again, and this time the game had a queue. Except it wasn\u0027t a queue that guaranteed access to the game after a specified wait. It was simply a retry button on a TWENTY MINUTE timer. For nearly half an hour I spammed the server selection screen, clicking US East, (Error: Busy), Server, US West (Error: Busy), Server, US East, (Error: Busy), Server, US West (Error: Busy), Server, US East, etc. I finally got in. I got into my city and went to region view. I worked on a new city in my region for another half hour and then the screen went black and SimCity closed. After a while I was able to reconnect. ALL MY WORK WAS GONE. I started a new city in the same area and IT HAPPENED AGAIN! It erased my progress. EA, this is horrible. If you don\u0027t have the server capacity to handle the launch of your always-on DRM scheme, you can\u0027t implement an always-on DRM scheme. I will never pre-order another EA title with always-on DRM. The fact that EA has the nevrve to say this disaster of a launch has only affected a smaller number of players is like rubbing salt in the wound. They\u0027re completely full of crap. Their lie only validates my opinion that EA has contempt for their customers.… ",

First, the obvious: The server overload proves correct all the folks who have been screaming about the always needing to be connected to the servers. I wasn\u0027t worried about DRM and no local saves originally, assuming people were just being anti-EA alarmists and that the game would work fine for me, but I was wrong. While it\u0027s broken, I can\u0027t even play a single player game which is all I want to do in Simcity anyway. That\u0027s stupid. I\u0027ve also had the game crash a dozen times and lost progress. Also, EA is simply telling folks to use a different server if one is busy. A)They\u0027re all busy. B)The city you\u0027ve put hours into doesn\u0027t transfer from one server to another, so you have to start all over if you use a different server. I also thought people were overstating how tiny the maps are, but again I was wrong. The map size is severely limiting. I\u0027ve managed to make large cities, but they all just feel cramped and generic as you have to use every inch of space to get an even decent population. Do you really need skyscrapers to reach 60K citizens? What if I want to build my real-life home city? I can\u0027t. Also, I understand the idea of specialization and not needing to build a large amount of industrial or residential in every city, but I find myself constantly having to bulldoze hospitals and police stations (which I had to pay money for) just to make room to put new roads that allow greater density. (also, why can\u0027t I simply pave over a dirt road with a high density road? They\u0027re the same size). Lack of subways, lack of farms, lack of map size, lack of customization all feel like an eventual cash grab. There\u0027s going to be so much DLC for this game it should be free to play. Even the day one DLC is $10 just to make a few of your buildings look German and give you one special landmark. Save yourself some money and buy the eventual \"game of the year\" edition which will include more. By then the servers should be fixed... if they haven\u0027t shut them off by then rendering the game unplayable. I\u0027m really disappointed overall. I\u0027ve played Simcity from the beginning. While I think the game engine is incredibly impressive, the graphics and music are good and there are moments of brilliance when the game works well, the whole thing is brought down by attempts to maximize money gouging at every possible turn. It just seems like a good game ruined by a cynical cash-grab. Feel free to wreck new games EA, but why destroy a beloved game that\u0027s been sitting on the shelves untouched for ten years?… ",

City size too small this is a mind-blower. Did the developers really think people would rather have nearly invisible microeconomic individual sim simuation rather than the ability to build full, complete cities that didn\u0027t look like ridiculous postage stamps? I get that it\u0027s a performance issue my machine is a beast let me have bigger cities. Let us ALL have bigger cities and get rid of the unhelpful low-level modeling. We came to build cities first, and enjoy drill-down metrics later. Always-on DRM: I don\u0027t like this mechanism in general, but I don\u0027t dismiss it out of hand either. For some online games, it can be useful to limit or prevent hacking and cheating. Diablo 3 needed that, and even though it takes away a lot from the game and can add much frustration, it has its positive points as well. But I cannot for the life of me figure out why in the hell SC5 has a mandatory on-line requirement to simply play the game. It makes no sense whatsoever. A good multiplayer option is always nice, and hopefully it actually works in this game, unlike some other city sims of late, but Sim City is at its core a single-player game that invites the user to experiment, tweak, mess around and generally goof off sometimes. Now? You can\u0027t even set a save point to go back to. You make a mistake, too bad. You ruin your economy? Start over from the beginning. Does EA not know what a \"simulation\" is? I didn\u0027t sign up for a Roguelike. Of all this game\u0027s misfires, this one is the hugest of all. How am I supposed to learn how to build anything efficiently or aesthetically or economically when the game punishes the living crap out of you for experimenting? I mean PUNISH, as in hours and hours of your life wasted, with very little learning payoff. It\u0027s a really huge problem that destroys this game. Never mind that the first 3 times I was able to play the game crashed and nothing was saved on the server anyway. But really bugs get fixed, and they don\u0027t ultimately deter me. But awful design decisions do. It\u0027s impossible to play this game without almost suffocating in the understanding that this game is going to do everything it can to nickle and dime you to death. Hell, they had DLC available the first day! $60 and I get a no-frills economy model? At least PRETEND like you aren\u0027t going to charge for every stupid park and church and billboard or whatever and give me a sense, however fleeting, that I have in my possession a complete game with loads of content. Stuff that was in the initial release of SC2K and SC4 is gone here. Gee, wonder how I can get it. Make a great game, give me great content up front and I will pay at least a little for great NEW content. The cynical microtransaction scheme in place here is ham-fisted and infuriating. The Glassbox engine is beautiful. The data maps are even moreso. This game is GORGEOUS. I love the tilt-shift look a brilliant design decision. The music is fine and the animations are ok, I hate the stupid Sim language but I can easily get past that. And that\u0027s what REALLY kills me this game could be, nay SHOULD be a great game. The technology is there. I mean right there on your machine. Glass box, microeconomic simulation, expensive production all right there waiting to be turned into a really cool game. But the implementation here is so bad, the overall game experience so misguided, and so radically different and worse than any SC before, that this game can ultimately only be considered a huge, massive and crushingly depressing flop. It\u0027s hard to imagine that you can take a brilliant game like SC2K or even SC4, add 10+ years and a customer base with PCs literally 1000x more powerful, and THIS is what you get. EA, I have never said this about any game ever, but I want my money back. This is a travesty.… ",

You cannot even launch the game without logging into EA\u0027s servers and the servers have been down more than they have been up.

Last night, I waited in a queue for 40 minutes to get in only to get kicked back out after 20 minutes and forced to wait in line again to get back in. The cities that you create on one server do not propagate to the other servers, so when one server goes down they say \"well you are free to play on server \u0027b\u0027, but because we are forced to play online we cannot save our cities locally so server B does not have my city on it, so I have to start over again, until server b goes down. I like this game, I really do, but I spent 160.00 (one license for me and one for my wife) on this game and I am unable to play it. I know everyone says this (I may have even said it myself before), but I am done with EA, I will never give them another dollar of my money. I don\u0027t care what franchise they buy out next, it could be the greatest game in the world, I will not buy it, everything they touch they ruin.

Instead, it was all about justification and explaining that they were \u0027heading in a different direction\u0027. What company in their right mind tries to tell the consumer what they want? The problem is, I doubt EA will learn any lessons from this because they\u0027re surfing the wave of popularity that already surrounds SimCity. They didn\u0027t earn it for themselves. What a bunch of pricks. Sure, the graphics are updated and 3D and the civic buildings can be modified and it\u0027s nice to watch sims running around doing their \u0027thang\u0027, but this is a SIMULATION, which demands realism and high levels of control, especially because this is the sixth incarnation and by this stage Maxis should freakin\u0027 know what works and what doesn\u0027t. What do we get? No subways. No terraforming. No highways. No control outside of the assigned squares. PITIFUL square sizes (what\u0027s the point of making curvy roads when you\u0027re discouraged from using them because there\u0027s no space). No ability to use height restrictions. Determining density from the type of road is just plain bizarre and awkward. And, I might add, not what\u0027s done in the real world. The thing I truly hate about this is that even if I try to be as creative as possible and build up my population, it\u0027s just gonna look pathetic because it\u0027ll be a bunch of small square skyscrapers with nothing but grass in between. Hey Maxis and EA here\u0027s a newsflash for you. I want to decide where my highways go, and what parts of my region are green, and how big my cities are, and where I want high density to go, and if my city has a subway system or not. I want it all to be my choice, not YOURS. And I haven\u0027t even mentioned the DRM or DLC, which no doubt will attempt to correct some of the glaring problems... for a modest fee, of course.

That\u0027s okay- you think- I\u0027ll just go to sandbox mode--- that can\u0027t possibly require a constant connection- Wrong-O! Hmm--- maybe a Private Sandbox--- that\u0027s another whole lotta Nope. What could be a charming and successful sim is marred- irreparably so- by a faulty and slipshod implementation. Chalk this user up to another that will (WILL) be getting refunded by EA, or disputing a credit card charge.… ",

Even after all the research I did on other Simcity forums from those who played beta I bought the game. Spent about 4 hours with it yesterday and I am quite disappointed in it. Let\u0027s get out the Pro\u0027s: Graphics Yes it looks very pretty. Even though I was shocked to see the \"sims\" looking like lego characters, overall the buildings and houses etc are very pretty. Modular upgrades Excellent idea, and works very well. I never did like the idea behind \"I need more firetrucks? build 5 more fire stations\". Now I can add onto the Firehouse and expand it\u0027s coverage that way. Works very well for Police, Fire, Schools, etc. Curved Roads I can actually build a realistic looking town. The curved roads are great. However they leave issues with putting down homes and buildings on them at times. Now for all the Cons: Online DRM I know everyone complains about this. I was willing to deal with it. Then the servers went down and I couldn\u0027t play. Is it first day issues? I\u0027m not sure but it was almost ironic when the servers went down. City Size Of course a huge complaint, other reviews mention this. Filled up my entire town in a little over an hour. Diversity of buildings Where are all the buildings I want to build? I\u0027m talking places like Museums, Churches, Zoo\u0027s, Post Offices, etc. etc. I can think of tons of missing content. Were these left out so EA can sell us buildings for $1 each later down the road? Transportation So far it seems all you get are buses. No Train stations, no subways, etc. I do believe you can build an airport eventually. The whole \"Upgrade town hall to unlock stuff\" Seems silly and unnecessary. I can\u0027t build a hospital because I already used my TownHall upgrade for something unrelated so I have to wait. It\u0027s hard to really say all the issues with the game in just bullet points. One of the biggest issues I have is simply with the density of zones. Let me paint a picture for you. You have a nice suburban part of your town, where say you want your middle to upper class to live. They would live on nice single lane roads with maybe some cul da sacs shooting off that road etc. You can build the road system, and then zone it for residential. That\u0027s it.... So what happens? You get mobile homes all over, and the only way to get the houses to \"upgrade\" to nicer establishment is to put parks/recreation all over nearby (and their effect is small size wise). Or you have to upgrade the road. Now who lives on a 4 lane road in a mansion? Not many people I can think of. It\u0027s absolutely idiotic. The game is definitely driven to have you share resources with neighboring regions. If you try to do it all in your one small city, you\u0027re in for a mess. So you have to essentially pause your game, and go to another city and start fresh there. Whether in the other city it\u0027s creating better jobs, or focusing on utilities to provide to your other city, etc. Overall, I am extremely disappointed in this game. A lot of the issues CAN be patched, fixed, upgraded with a lot of work from Maxis. But in the state the game is now, it should never have been released. This will probably be a game I shelve for a bit, and hope that in a few months it becomes playable. As it sits now, I paid for a beta copy. If I could return this to EA I would.… ",

If you bought this game thinking that it wasn\u0027t ALWAYS ONLINE, you\u0027re an idiot. Been playing this game a ton since it became available i was able to download it amazingly fast which was a nice suprise. I figured with so many people trying to access it, that it would take a long time to get. Got right into the game with my origin account info. Love that aspect and how you can see others around you with their origin accounts as well. I\u0027ve had ZERO que wait times and the game loads fine almost every time. I had one instance when i came home for lunch and had to log out of origin and then back in to get into the game. Took me all of 30 seconds. Firstly, on the game play itself. It\u0027s smooooottthh. Everything you need is right there and easily accessible. you can scroll in and view your city at the sim\u0027s level, which is really cool. The map sizes are smaller for a reason. In SimCity 4 i would first lay out just a massive amount of farming and then build a small city center from there and then slowly build into a metropolis. With SimCity 5 it forces you to really analyze how you want your city laid out and how to make it look asthetically pleasing as well as economically viable. The specialization is probably the best idea in the game. The first city i build is not so pretty so i had to start demolishing sections of town as i was making it more of a cultural center for tourism (I\u0027m saving casino\u0027s for last as i think they\u0027ll be a lot of fun). It really emphasises on basic theory behind specialization. For instance, with culture i wanted places easily accessible to tourists so i built a nice bus system with close stops all around the attractions. Then i decided to build some nicer commercial areas around and my revenue just went through the roof! Now i\u0027m trying to build a highly educated city with top research so this means with top research/gadget production i need a really good market and way to export my goods while keeping the land value around these areas. These are all things that SimCity makes you think about! An oxymoron to put it is that it\u0027s so much easier to play, however it\u0027s much harder to master than previous simcity games. If you let go of the old you\u0027ll love this game. I even wake up a bit earlier before work to put in 30min into my city. There are so many cool little nitches with this game i won\u0027t go through all of them. Better to discover on your own! For the downsides, some of the road building can be annoying. I want to build a road in a certain way and the game will snap it in particular ways sometimes. I like things to be exactly how i like them in my city as i usually want it a certain way so something else will fit well within that area. Ie. i wanted to build a really nice park center within my high income sims and because the roads wouldn\u0027t work exactly how i wanted them within the park it didn\u0027t look at natural (Asthetically pleasing as i had envisioned). The other downside to me is that it\u0027s easier to manage your city funds. I remember in SimCity 4 you could really get yourself in trouble. In 5 it\u0027s really easy to keep your income up to where you\u0027re always in the black. For example, in prior sims i would be really sketchy of taking out a bond/loan. In 5 i\u0027ll take out a bond, build some homes, infrastructure, and/or other revenue generating ventures and never really worry about it. I\u0027d like a bit more thought into taking out bonds than what is currently there.… ",

Middle of day 2, my region won\u0027t load. It goes without saying that the release of this game is a fiasco, but what is rightfully upsetting is that EA has broken very logical convention for a game of this type, and really gone out of its way to put its customers at risk of dealing with this inconvenience. If EA were a TV manufacturer, an airline, a pharmaceutical company....they would be issuing refunds right now. In the least case, they owe a very public apology to their customers who preordered or purchased before they had their servers working. As far as the DRM is concerned, I cannot imagine a poorer way to treat paying customers. As for the actual gameplay that I was able to experience: If I had to sum it up in one word, unfortunately that word would be \"lame\". Aside from the day one bugs, such as not being able to sell power to my partially-grown neighboring city, I was seriously let down by the abnormally anemic size of the cities and by the shallowed complexity as compared to SC4. I miss the graphs...they were the best way to show you how well you have done over time, and what elements changed in your SC4 city. The demand system is not doing well: I had half of the acreage of my city covered in middle-wealth families, a quarter in middle-wealth commercial, and a quarter in middle wealth manufacturing. What are the sims telling me? The residents say there are no jobs and not enough shopping. The shops say there are not enough potential employees or shoppers. The factories say there are not enough potential employees or \"places to ship their goods\", i.e, shops. So yeah, that is perhaps the most essential system in the game and it\u0027s currently half-baked. It is visually decent, but the animations are still buggy (i.e. sims jittering around as if possessed). I believe it is completely fair to compare this game to SC4, particularly as the developers have spent plenty of time alluding to the connection between the two. At this moment in time, SC4 is hands-down a more challenging, more complex, and, without a doubt, more rewarding game. The multiplayer aspect was a bold diversion from the logical direction, and has thus far not only failed to add anything meaningfully positive but has made the game literally unplayable for the core market who preordered or purchased in the first days. Obviously, fixing this issue is priority one. Expanding the city size is priority two. These two glaring issues need to be fixed before we can pretend that this game is worth more than $20 (issue one needs to be fixed before this game is worth a penny!). I\u0027m not sure we\u0027re ever going to see this game being worth the $60 that so many of us have paid. I\u0027m rating a zero, obviously, for the fact that on day two I still cannot play the game. If I were to pretend that I could play the game, I would give it a 3.5. Overall rating rounded up to 2.

On the one hand, SimCity is an incredibly deep and engrossing simulation you could lose hours in. On the other hand the game is a flawed with bugs and backed by unreliable serves to maintain the \"always online\" requirement. There are also unnecessary limitations that appear to set the stage for DLC to be purchased in the in-game store down the road. Lets look at game play first, for the most part the game\u0027s engine is stable, I experienced no crashes due to the software itself. SimCity is a much more colorful and vibrant than it\u0027s predecessors, resembling the SIMs more than anything else. The depth and detail of the game engine is incredible when you consider everything that goes on in a city at once, all being tracked by the software. You can even select an individual SIM and follow them all around the town as they go from school, to work etc. Building your city has never been easier with a multiple road types including curved roads. And your buildings can be customized in new ways by adding modular additions to hospitals, city hall, and many others. I did however notice some hiccups in the game engine that need to be addressed by the developers; mainly erratic and strange behavior by certain SIMs on the roadways. Delivery trucks and buses would sometimes randomly stall out or just simply drive around aimlessly. Usually a restart would correct this problem, but these errors slowed my city\u0027s development to a craw. I also ran into irritating problems placing roads; the game prohibiting me from placing a road where I know it should be able to go. The New SimCity also uses much smaller map sizes for each city. I didn\u0027t mind this as much as some people, because once you fill out one map you can move on to the next-door map in the region. Since the cities in the region can share resources, jobs, etc I decided to dedicate each map as a \"segment\u0027 of a larger city. Now my whole region is one giant city, with one map being the residential area, one map being industrial, and so on. The developers stated the smaller map size was due to limitations of people\u0027s computers to run the game with bigger maps. I call BS on that one, checking resources, my 3-year-old PC can run this game on max settings, utilizing less that 70% of the system resources to do it. I expect to see EA cramming DLC large maps down our throats at a later date. Most of my issues with the SimCity are a result of the \"Always-online\" DRM built into the game. This is not about, whether DRM is \"right\" or not, or even fair. The issue is the DRM was done very poorly and negatively affects the game-play to a point where it actually hinders the player\u0027s ability to enjoy the game they paid 60 bucks for. I was disconnected 5 times form EA\u0027s overwhelmed servers, two of those 5 times I had to wait longer than 20 minutes to log back in. Considering I was playing a SINGLE PLAYER game, and I\u0027d paid 60 bucks for it, I didn\u0027t expect to have to wait in line to play the game. That\u0027s like being told by Ford that you can only drive your new car when/where THEY want you to. If the roads are open, they should be free, and I should be able to drive where I want. The reality is Game companies will continue to do this only if the consumer continues to open their wallets. That being said it\u0027s tough to punish SimCity for it\u0027s publisher\u0027s shady tactics, the game is very fun. But DRM IS PART OF THE GAME, it IS a FEATURE. If a game had a terrible installation program that didn\u0027t work on many computers, reviewers would most certainly account this into their review score. DRM must also be considered in the review scores of this game because it is part of the game, just like every other feature whether it be a building or a menu. The bottom line is if you love SimCity, you\u0027ll love this game, DRM or not. The DRM does limit the game (and that\u0027s the real reason they made smaller maps) and it does make the game downright unplayable at times. This is because when you buy SimCity, you\u0027re not just buying the game software, but your buying bandwidth and space on EA\u0027s servers, and quite frankly EA hasn\u0027t been up to the task so far.… ",

The basic problem this model has is that in the long term you only provision for 20% of your users being online at any one point in time. However, during launch that\u0027s not exactly the case. You can easily have 80% or more logging in all at the same time. Without an offline mode to release the stress of everyone logging in you end up with people taking the day off to play and being justifiably upset that they can\u0027t even start-up the game. The tutorial could have and should have been an offline option. It would have made it so that people could have a taste of the game without hammering the servers all at once. This model also requires the servers to be up-to-date. If you were able to get on last night and then later this morning you may have found yourself faced with a forced tutorial button that you weren\u0027t last night. This is clearly due to the servers being on a different version of the software. The is the most likely cause of game corruptions this morning. A 60$ franchise title is not the time or place to test out new strategies. You should know this will work long before you launch. Instead we\u0027re faced with inexperienced admins who didn\u0027t know to keep the servers up to date for launch or to turn them Off if they were on the wrong version. This is stuff you only learn with experience, and Sim City was not the time or place to get that experience. This tells me that they\u0027re using an Ad-Hoc methodology, and we should expect more hiccups as long as they insist on an instant roll-out of updates and not have the server go though some burn time to make sure it works first. For Single Player the maps are a bit small. You can work around it a bit, and I can see how this encourages Multi-Player. However, I\u0027m the type of person who plays MMOs Single Player so I personally get very little benefit from this model. The game play from prior versions is vastly improved. If you\u0027re willing to wait a Month for server load to die down you probably should wait. You\u0027ll be able to get a far superior experience if you do.… ",

Then I got dropped:-( You see, I live in an area where I can only get a pretty poor internet connection. 3MB, and it isn\u0027t the most reliable either. There are the random drop offs and what not. Now, none of this is EA\u0027s fault, however when I reconnected I was back in the queue.... again..... and so I waited..... and unfortunately due to a phonecall I missed my window to get back into the game so I was placed into the queue again. Now I admit, I should have been prepared for the always on, but due to my current experience\u0027s with their queue and their DRM I have found myself unable to play the single player game I wanted to play. This has left a bitter taste in my mouth and has seriously got me contemplating a pirated copy: I don\u0027t pirate \"arrrrrr\" as I have a job, so I purchase all my games. But this experience made me feel that pirating could be the way to go. Which is a shame, as there is a shining jewel of a game beneath this stool water that is the always on DRM.… ",

Took a bit over an hour to download and install, which is lengthy but exceeded my expectations for a release day download. Once installed, the 3 available US servers were predictably full during US prime time, so I figured better to avoid the queue and take a potential performance hit choosing an EU server with space available until load dies down over time. In fact, there was no performance issue at all. Played about 5 hours with one crash, after which I got right back in. If the EU server with my game on it happens to be full during their off hours later and I can\u0027t get back to cities I\u0027ve started, Ill be less pleased. The game mechanics so far are great. If you are concerned about city size, you are doing it wrong. The game is designed to have multiple specialized cities in a region working together, not one sprawling metropolis doing it all. It feels like people who complain about this don\u0027t understand the mechanic or are stubbornly ignoring to try to play the same style as the previous titles. If you are one of these people, you\u0027re gonna have a bad time. In my play time I managed to get an industrial town off the ground and the use its resources to get a casino/residential/commercial town going. The mechanics of sharing resources and services between cities is fun and probably gets pretty challenging to manage in large regions. If you choose a 16 city region, running out of space should be a very distant concern. It can be a bit of an annoyance having to jump to and load another city to tweak some service you are sharing (add more truck bays or what have you), then jump back to the city you are working on. If I got it going on that SSD I\u0027ve had my eye on, even that modest annoyance would probably become negligible. I knocked off a couple of points for the annoying always online DRM, despite the fact that it has yet to cause me any issues. I doubt I will play much, if any, on public regions because, quite frankly, if the people who are writing these reviews are the people playing the game, I don\u0027t want to play with any of you!… ",

Basically, they designed the game to force you to specialize each \"city\" for a role to support another \"city\" in your region. No option to just make/play in one large area anymore. Oh, and you may as well section off a huge portion of your already tiny play area to expand your town hall... - Loading/switching between the tiny cities on the region view seems to take forever.

The good: - Nice graphics. - The changes made to streamline building are nice. I realize there are people out there that like to build every last water pipe and power line, but I thought including all of that built-in to the roads was a good idea. The city specializations are interesting and fun to tinker with. - Allowing friends and/or other random people build in your region has potential. Overall its pretty \"meh\". Its more \"SimTown\" inside of a \"SimRegion\" than it is \"SimCity\".… ",

Sim City 4 you can save your own game you can build an actual city. Sim City 4 is not a little square confined by white dotted lines. Sim City (5) has fun gameplay until you fill up the map in a couple hours. This by far is the most jarring thing to me. 10 years later and the maps get smaller and confined by dotted lines. I hope they fix this without charging more money for DLC that should be standard in a AAA release. DLC is fine if its not removed from the original game to sell later… ",

I couldn\u0027t play SimCity because of EA\u0027s pathetic platform for almost ten hours, unable to download it. Once I did download it, I took me half and hour to eventually connect to a server. Simcity\u0027s online-only aspect has bit EA on the backside, proving that, for now, it is not a reliable way to deliver a game. I\u0027ve played SimCity 3000 and 4, and it looks like I will continue to do so after this train-wreck.

Games will only save/load if EA\u0027s server can accommodate your request; often times it can\u0027t, and you lose data. Also adds to the sluggish behavior of the game, as contacting and sending packets to an overseas, overloaded server, is a lot slower than writing to your local disk. Looking forward to the teams that will be working on a local server emulator to remove the DRM requirement hopefully the loss in income will send a strong message, as clearly, shouting \"screw you\" to your customer base is still resulting in sales.… ",

This game should be called SimTown, not SimCity; the plot sizes in the new SimCity are embarrassingly small, but even if they increased the size I don\u0027t think the game would look much like a city because the buildings look disproportionate/cartoonish/repetitive and the spaces between buildings look like eye sores (they should at least fill them in the way the game CitiesXL does). A single plot can be filled within the first 10 minutes then all you do is stare at your city, upgrade here and there, and struggle to fit in some of the new buildings you end up unlocking it\u0027s a miserable experience after you fill up the entire plot of land. The only creativity in this game is making those unconventional curved roads. This game feels more like a node simulator than a city simulator (if that makes any sense), and everything is automatic this game was made for lazy people it seems. There is no terraforming. The cities in the regions are separated, so there are no super metropolises or your very own created rail and road systems in your very own created wilderness areas which separate your other cities. No farming. No subways. I also found a lot of the features like the statistic maps, the different kinds of roads, the people walking on the streets, etc.. to be gimmicky, for example, you\u0027ll always end up using the high capacity roads, so why not just start out with them (it\u0027s also a pain to upgrade your low density roads later on in game) so the presence of dirt roads and such are gimmicky to me make the most of the small land you are given, right?… ",

Now most people judge games hardly, one thing out of place and it gets a zero. The two biggest reasons are: Drm servers, which ea said they would fix. the size of the City and region is smaller, which doesn\u0027t bother me because having too many cities in a region made multitasking hard, here I can easily manage the cities in my region without going back and forth every five seconds. The gameplay is also much simpler then simcity 4. In simcity 4, none of my cities lasted longer then a day, in this simcity I can easily keep my city going for a long time. The multiplayer is also a good feature because I can now play with other people, and enjoy it. Zoning is also easier, I don\u0027t need to do high density, low density, or any of that, I just need to put a road down and BAM, I get skyscrapers. Also the deletion of power lines and water pipes and making it flow by street is also a good bonus making it simpler then it\u0027s predecessors. Though all this simplicity makes the game to easy at some points, making it tedious to keep going. Though it\u0027s not a big deal, I can just make another region with a different play style, or blow up the current city with disasters. In all, simcity is a great game, though flawed in non gameplay components, I give it an 8 out of 10… ",

Is it worth it? You be the judge...everyone is different. I mean, look at Metacritic (no offense Metapeeps), in order to even write or comment on here, you have to sign up, give them your email addy, birth date, blood type, first born, etc (ok, kidding on those last few...I don\u0027t want to get any Meta-lawsuits). Why? Cuz they want to just keep things organized? No way! They want to email you stuff that makes them money. I don\u0027t like it, but I put up with it (and also check the box that says \"don\u0027t send me your crap\"). Why do I do this, because I\u0027m \"paying for the service.\" I weigh the pros and cons and figure, \"ok, I like Metacritic, so I\u0027m willing to give you my email address, etc, so that I can use your site.\" So, the same thing goes with EA and all they\u0027re BS. I don\u0027t like it, but it\u0027s the price to pay. For those who are just protesting, good for you. But sadly nothing will happen, guys. I mean, if Occupy Wallstreet didn\u0027t really do anything, do you think Occupy EA is really going to do anything? Pick your battles. Instead of protesting, design your own stuff. Competition is how you \"change\" big business, not picketing. Now with that all behind me, here is the truth about the game a real score to get a sense of what this game is really like (with above problems \"ignored\"...or just not worried about). If you like Sim City games, you will like this game. If you like city building games, you will like this game. If you like being creative, you\u0027ll like this game. This is a cool, fun game. The graphics are modernized Simcity graphics. Do they look like Battlefield 3 graphics? No, but they\u0027re not going for that here. What they\u0027re going for is Simcity graphics, and they look good (and for some reason they just make me happy). The music and sound fx are great, too. As for game play, being able to zoom in and really get a VERY good sense of how things are going, is really amazing. The simulation is out of this world. I am surprised the game runs so smoothly considering how much computing all that unique simulating must take up. To be honest, I think that is why the map sizes are so small. They just can\u0027t run that sort of simulation on a map the size of the ones in Simcity 4. Which leads me to map size. Yes, they\u0027re small, and at first (before really playing), I was bummed out about it. But then I started doing what I think the Maxis people wanted us to do, and that is specialize cities, and make your region be one big city. So, instead of setting aside one area of my map for industry, the other side for residential, etc, I use one map for things like power, water, etc, and the others for things like education and big buildings...or whatever else you want to do. If you go at this game with that sort of goal, you really start to not mind the smaller plots (but hopefully future DLC give us bigger plots). Other than that, the game is a lot of fun. On a fun factor scale, it\u0027s a solid 10. Most people say prayers or kiss their wife good night right before falling asleep....losers like me found themselves thinking about this game and what I\u0027d do differently next time I played, before going to sleep. So, be warned, you will waste hours and hours on this game. In conclusion and in my opinion, get the game...it\u0027s really fun. Yes, the required-to-play servers will eventually be turned off, but that won\u0027t be for a long, long time (there will probably be a new Simcity by then). In the meantime, you\u0027ll be able to enjoy a lot of time playing this very fun game.… ",

As such I went into the game with an open mind. A good chunk of the bombs being dropped on this game by users is the complaining of the needing an internet presence to play it. This being 2013, is not a new thing. We can hate it all day long but the end of the day it comes down to piracy and a company wanting to protect their software from being freely shared across the world. I take it as something that is annoying but at this time required, and as much venom spewed at EA for implementing this can equally be spewed at the people who pirate everything that caused this to have to be put in place. Sweeping away all of the online presence complaints we get to the meat of the game, which is what I care most about. I was able to log in, the server was down a couple of times but resolved itself within minutes of my loading, and I played pretty much all night. I am a huge fan of the series, and I have to say that my impression of Sim City 5 is that it is a fairly solid title. It kept me entertained for most of the night and had me doing the \"just another 5 minutes\" that few games seem to be able to do for me. I enjoy seeing my city in 3D now. The simulation aspect is like it has always been, or seems to be. I think as a Sim City game it does what it has always done, and that was what I personally was looking for. The only gripes that I really had focused on lot sizes, but that\u0027s not something that will make me not want to play it. Its also something that I feel can be addressed with an expansion, which I am sure will follow much like the SIMS do (I even see some interactivity between the SIMS and SIM CITY as it was in the past with predecessors of the game) So I say if you are a fan of the series, or are looking for a solid city building simulation, this game delivers what it says it will. The DRM crying doesn\u0027t affect the game to me. It\u0027s an anti-piracy method that is in place because that\u0027s the world we live in. Love that or hate it. If you hate DRM, don\u0027t buy the game. As to requiring the servers being up all the time to play and in \"X years the servers will be gone and you won\u0027t be able to play\", I leave the logical fallacies out of the review. Jumping to conclusions doesn\u0027t really serve a review very well.… ",

It has been a good 3 or 4 years since a game has sucked me only for me to finally check the clock and realize I need to go to bed for work. I thought the city size was going to be a bad thing but it actually enhances the game play. You are able to start a second, third or even fourth city in your region. My first city is now over 50,000 residents and going strong. I have just started my second city in the region and can see myself being sucked in for a long time. Which is going to really put a damped on the Starcraft expansion coming out next week.… ",

Got pretty frustrated now, but wanted to eat least get to the meat of the game. I wanted through yet another queue, only to log in and find my city was corrupted. It was saved on their servers. Why the hell was it corrupted? So I uninstalled and asked for a refund. Giving the game 1 star instead of 0 because I actually got one. Thanks for ruining another franchise, EA.… ",

Then there is the whole cloud and always online issue, being online didn\u0027t seem too much of a problem for me, but not know when it saves is annoying. A number of times it has crashed, and taken me to the desktop, so I log back in and the city has gone. But the good things are the sims, amazing seeing every person and every car, and you can follow them all the way to work. It like they are actual people, and traffic is real because too many cars. Public transport does seem very used by sims, put in busses and the car more than half. They have put more focus onto having to get the buildings to upgrade, which give more of a challenge. And upgrading buildings is great, and means you spend less time waiting to save up to buy something. Bad things: 1. the map size feels so small, and there is not enough space to match the demands. For me sim city was always about rapid expansion. 2. When you play with other people, there are loads of plots of land someone has claimed and then not built anything in. And other cities are really important in this version, you have to share sims and resources. And people don\u0027t really work together, they just make a tiny city the same as everyone else on the map. Plus everyone wants to get the nice flat area\u0027s first, leaving just the cliffs or island levels. 3. There feels like there is so much missing content.

Not possible to create your own regions or terrain for that matter. (Maxis, ever heard of terraforming? If you are simulating something, do it slightly believable. Or is this not a simulation game?) 5. Suck you dry. (Yes, the layout of this game is made for sucking you dry and in the bad way- if there is a good one. They will probably open up the possibility for you to have bigger regions. But they will charge you for it. One lot at a time. They will also open up landmarks and cool new building. But they will charge you for it. They will open up terraforming. And again they will charge you for it. In the end you have spent 300$ on a game you wont be able to play say in 5 years time since you are renting it from EA!! ) 4. Not possible to save your cities since the game autosaves for you. (If you make a misstake you stick with it just as in real life. Matbe this is a good thing? But wait, what if my cat jumps up on my keybord and places a really expensive building in the wrong place. That\u0027s right its a cat mistake but you\u0027ll have to live with it) 5. Me and You. Guys, we have just supported everything we think is wrong with this game. Be it Origin, EA, whatever. We have just condoned the destruction of a game we were all suppose to love and which many of us enjoyed as kids. How did we do this? Simply by donating 80$ to EA. Yes donated, the game is on their servers. Not on your computer! Right now we are EA\u0027s How does it feel?… ",

The regions are too small and I didn\u0027t have enough time to see what the resource specialization would do after running out or what the water table does when you run out. Does it ever come back I can\u0027t tell because the game stopped working.

The regions are too small and I didn\u0027t have enough time to see what the resource specialization would do after running out or what the water table does when you run out. Does it ever come back I can\u0027t tell because the game stopped working. Now that the servers are limping along load times are now expected to be in the minutes scale and if you play solo you need to switch between cities more frequently which means you will be spending a lot of time in front of a loading screen. In addition for the foreseeable future \"non-essential features\" such as the leaderboards, social aspects, are non-functional. One of the worst gameplay changes they have made is the removal of the accelerated time mode which is critical to playing the game enjoyably unless you want to wait for a very long time for anything to happen. I have also lost game progress when the client randomly disconnects as there is not even a button to save to the cloud or a good way to warning you that you\u0027ve lost your DRM connection and have two minutes before you get booted out. In addition trading when the servers were working took forever to complete and takes the resources away the moment you gift them and if you switch to the other city it can take tens of minutes to complete. All the while you can be waiting. The glassbox simulation system seems a bit strange in that technically it is all just flowery GUI for what is quite simple. For example electricity and water are treated as parcels when in reality that is not possible and more so for electricity. When you lose power and build back capacity it can take a long time for the city to react and similarly for water. The map size is also quite constrictive and the lack of terrain editing functionality is a fairly glaring omission. You can not also create your own regions as in previous games and automatic road connections can get quite fiddly at times. If your roads are even a degree off and running near the edge of the map it can present difficulties creating a smooth section of road. A lot of the focus of the new SimCity 5 seems to be centered around the roads and basically everything must be attached to a road or it will not function or even be placeable. (You can\u0027t even place parks without snapping it to a road) The automatic grid guides are also not very smart and don\u0027t tell you anything about how far apart is too much and the zone tiles give no indication of how much space will be needed for the larger high density buildings. Generated curved road is an absolute nightmare and the snaps go all over the place. In short, game design is a step backwards, game doesn\u0027t work properly, features have been removed that are critical to the game. And in a few years the game may just cease to exist if they turn off the servers.… ",

Why do today\u0027s game designers think they have to do everything differently just to create the next casual DLC-cashcow? Why the fuzzy, absolutely not stunning graphics? Why the child-like presentation? On top, when finally playing the game, I have to conclude that in regards to gameplay and mechanics it\u0027s simply inferior to the good old SimCity Will created decades ago.

Anyone who pirated this game has cracked it and happily been playing it while people who paid for it are stuck with intrusive DRM that messes up our ability to use the product we paid for. Personally from what I was able to play I did not like it much at all. In fact I went over to gog.com (I love those guys) and I got sim city 4 instead and I am sending sim city 5 back for a refund and probably will never buy it again. Sim city 5 first of all felt incomplete, a lot of things seemed missing like I dont like how the city size is limited as I remember EA saying they had much larger cities running themselves but scaled them back for the final product, you can\u0027t teraform like in past games, no subways, no farmlands, no power lines, no water lines and so on. A lot of little things are absent from the game which I fear means they will be sold to us later through microtransactions or DLC packs. Because EA has a nasty habit of nickel and diming their customers to death with over priced DLC and they love to force microtransactions into every game they make, even the ones where it makes no sense like dead space 3. Like the sims 3 for instance is not a new game, its many years old but yet if you want to buy it and all the content (including packs with pets, furniture and other such trivial things) you would spend upwards of 400 bucks or maybe more.

Multiplayer. While a interesting idea is being shoe horned into the game whether you want it or not. Personally I feel it is just an excuse to use always on DRM and force players to play their games and save content on their servers. I don\u0027t like it myself but others might. I want to sit, plot, plan and build my cities how I want with no interference from others. I don\u0027t want to play sim city to be social. It requires Origin which I still dislike for numerous reasons. I don\u0027t even care for Steam really but I use steam and one digital service is enough for me. I don\u0027t want to spread my games out on multiple online services. It has the look and feel of the sims, which I don\u0027t care for. It feels too cartoony, too unrealistic and it just feels like I am playing a sims game. It also doesn\u0027t spark my creativity and desire to articulate every little thing in my head. I don\u0027t want to go into great detail and consideration when building. I found myself trying to very hard, but not actually \"feeling it\" so to speak. I was trying to force myself to enjoy it like I did previous games but it wasn\u0027t happening. But as soon as I loaded up sim city 4 it all came flooding back to me.… ",

Personally, I have never had a problem with Always online drm, but one that keeps the player from playing what they payed for is very much a problem. Its like paying 20$ for a movie and food and not being able to eat your food or watch the movie. What people need to know is that its not a bad game at all. The developer has nothing to do with the main problems. Its EA\u0027s poorly layed out buisiness model that is the problem, and thats why I give this game a 6.5, its game mechanics are fine besides some bugs here and there. the real problem is the restrictive and near completely broken servers/DRM.… ",

I have been able to get into the Getting Started screen, about 3 times after continuously trying for almost all of those 24 hours, but the tutorial just says unavailable at this time and to try again later.

All I have gotten for my $80 purchase so far is a pretty installer screen, another icon on my Origin account and a holographic box the CD came in. Somehow, I feel ripped off. If I released a product, then shipped an empty box with a note saying \"terribly sorry, but we experienced technical issues so you\u0027ll get the product in a couple weeks\" after promising a certain shipping date, I would not be in business very long. I estimate I have spent roughly $2000 on Maxis products alone through EA from Sim City 2000, 3000, 4 and every The SIms game with all expansions plus microtransactions, but this $80 on Simcity5 will be the last Maxis and EA receive from me. I will no longer purchase University Life, or any other expansions or stuff packs, and the excitement I felt over the announcement of The SIms 4 is now dead. I and the whole gaming community require a profound apology for this debarcle, may I suggest upgrading everyone who has bought this fancy icon a free upgrade to the digital deluxe edition as well, or at the very least some sort of refund.

Maps are smaller then ever and while it has many great features these are virtually the same as the four games before it. The innovation that was promised really isn\u0027t there.

These didn\u0027t seem linked either so two hard restart bugs on launch isn\u0027t good at all. The biggest issue so far is the constant connecting to server issues associated with the needlessly over the top DRM. This function shouldn\u0027t make a game non-playable but it does. It kind of shocking that EA are so over-protective now that they will willingly hamper a players experience. I hope this is quickly patched.

Releasing in Europe when most United States players are using those servers just to play already. If you are going to release a game that is online only, you better damn well be ready to support the thousands or millions of sales that you expect. This criticism is only important because there is absolutely no way to play the game without their server infrastructure. Denial of service to their own customers. No excuses. As for the game its self. Extremely small city size. I managed a fully grown city with great income/traffic/population in just under 5 hours. Almost funding a archology all on my own. This of course, before the servers crashed. It\u0027s not very challenging, too small, and quite frankly, a step backwards from Sim City4. Emergency services are now a part of your traffic, but the AI can\u0027t determine their importance. They stop at lights, traffic does not let them by. A criminal can hold up traffic which holds up the police that are trying to catch him. Not very intuitive. It has its moments, I\u0027ll give it that, but it is truly a disaster. I assume there will be fixes to many of these things in the future, but wouldn\u0027t be half surprised if EA mandated them as DLC costs to the consumer. Overall, extremely despairing.

The lack of a save/load feature is painful because you can\u0027t experiment with your city layout once you put down your roads, if you made them slightly too widely or narrowly spaced, you can\u0027t plop the buildings you want. And since the addons to the different upgradable buildings (a nice feature in itself) can only be placed in certain locations, you may need to bulldoze and rebuild the base building a few times to find the right location but you can\u0027t just reload a save to do so. The map size is also way too small. Sure you can specialize and design multiple cities in a region, but I play SimCity because I like creating and designing massive urban sprawl it\u0027s too simple to do it in bite sized chunks. And then the region map looks strange with tightly packed squares of development separated by empty wide open spaces. If they want to leave regions intact, so be it, but make them directly adjacent to each other so the empty space is gone its an eyesore otherwise. Now to go back to the server issue pure incompetence. They should have known by the amount of the preorders what the expected server volume needs to be. Once the game rolls out in other countries, the volume is only going to go up, and they haven\u0027t even solved the problem for existing customer. Not only is this a PR disaster by itself but EA\u0027s overall marketing strategy of micropurchasing depends on satisfied customers. Customers aren\u0027t going to be willing to be nickeled and dimed for add-ons if they feel cheated by the initial product. Irritated fanbois with short attention spans are one thing. SimCity has a lot of long term fans who are now well into adulthood and have been playing the series for decades (such as myself) cynical marketing and poor technical execution. This game is taxing everyone\u0027s patience and customers deserve much better. ***One final comment from someone who knows PR: thanking customers for their patience when they are actually not patient, and have valid and justifiable reasons for their frustration is the opposite of soothing it causes more frustration by making the speaker sound condescending and arrogant. Just apologize and tell us what you\u0027re doing to fix the problems stop thanking us for our waning \u0027patience\u0027.… ",

I hate to base a score partly on the publisher, but in this case it directly impedes my enjoyment of the game.

They broke the game for single player because they needed the restrictions to get multiplayer to work. If you don\u0027t want multiplayer this SimCity (5) is not for you. I do not like that it requires a constant connection to the servers, if it loses connection it doesn\u0027t save and it will eventually kick you out of your city (and not save it).

While I\u0027ll agree that has been a major nuisance and limitation to the game, there\u0027s more absent from this game than just the simple inability to play when one chooses (a major flaw in its own right). First, the game has a very limiting feel to it. I\u0027ve played SimCity since version 1.0 in the early nineties and not since that version have I felt so boxed in. The city size, the method for which zones are laid down, the size and scale of certain city facilities. There seems to be no organic aspect to this game, and it brings back memories of the Societies debacle from a few years ago. From SC4, I could build a network of major roads and then spray a large residential zone within a major road loop and all of the smaller streets would auto create (sometimes with a bit of frustration, but nonetheless). In the new SC, I spend most of my time redesigning road layouts to maximize the usage of my zones. Build your city your way is simply not the case. And while I don\u0027t want this to be a rant on the city size, it cannot be ignored. We\u0027ve gone from small cities in SC1 to medium cities SC2000 to all-out metropolises in SC4. Part of the excitement and what has kept me occasionally going back to a 10 year old game in SC4 is the almost hobby nature associated with building and cultivating a large, mega city with all of the intricacies, challenges, and endless opportunities for uniqueness. The new Simcity completely fails in this regard as the new city size feels almost claustrophobic. It would be one thing if the region seemed more connected, but instead it feels like you\u0027re building a vacuum that has some distant connection to a far away land. You have almost zero control on designing the connection between one neighboring city to another, that\u0027s already been done for you. The online integration of this game has created unending frustration. No ability to locally save is the big negative for me. I recognize the desire for a server connection for DRM or other reasons, but not allowing me to save my game locally just opens up EA to constant complaints about lost game saves, etc. This is extremely frustrating (as I\u0027ve already lost 3 cities to the apparent server outage of 3/6). I\u0027ve often explained Simcity to non Simcity players as the modern version of collecting model trains. It is not really a computer game, but more of digital hobby machine. A place where creativity and design can be tested in real-world with mathematics and simulation. This new Simcity completely misses that mark. While its pretty, it fails as the open creative world so well mastered in its last true previous iteration. Furthermore, the simulation engine appears to fail at creating an accurate sim environment.… ",

As for the graphical design itself, the buildings and vehicles look very toyish, I personnaly didn\u0027t mind but that didn\u0027t feel real. In terms of gameplay, well it\u0027s really like the other sim cities. I don\u0027t understand the \"reboot\" of SimCity since not much has changed in terms of gameplay, except it became much, much more simple. Indeed, while you may have some negative cash income for a few minutes when you\u0027re building stuff, you\u0027ll get back on your feet in no time thanks to loans and no-cost RCI zones. Pop houses, raise taxes, people keep coming anyway. Wonderful. This makes the game very sandbox-style, but not for long. Indeed, cities size are very small and you won\u0027t spend more than 5 hours to fill completely a city, and another 5-10 hours to upgrade it to its full extent. The worst part, though, is how the game is designed to be played: you\u0027ll need a permanent connection to internet if you want to play. Yes, SimCity intends to behave like a MMO... for a solo experience (well, you can play with other people too, but you\u0027ll still build your own city in the end regardless of what\u0027s being built in your neighboors cities). And what a shame this is. As of today, the game is not playable because of servers issues since several hours. This raises the question of what will happen, in five years (or less), when EA decides to close the servers. After 10 years of sc4, I sometimes find myself reinstalling the game and play it a little. Obviously this won\u0027t be doable with SimCity if the servers are shut down, the game just won\u0027t be accessible. Add all of those troubles to the fact that you could already buy DLC before the game was launched, and you got the gist of it.… ",

Companies like these need to understand that adequate testing is paramount for a successful launch and take what you feel to be reasonable performance with load and double it.

After about an hour and a half, we finally found eachother on a european server and started playing together. There is more but I want to get to the in game stuff too. In game troubles: P4: Crashes, occasional crashes, or cities that load forever until you reset the game. P5: Cities that you claim once, but if you go to region view and try to get back the \u0027wrong\u0027 way tries to make you claim them again. P6: Absolutely terrible concurrency. I gifted 50k simoleons to a neighbor but it didn\u0027t show up for 2 hours (but immediately came out of my account). P7: Confusing or broken sharing of power, water, etc. I have a city producing an extra 200MW of power and another starts buying power, but it says it is buying 13MW of available 40MW, and still has a deficit of another 20MW. Why not just get more power??? P8: Firetrucks and buses that are REALLY stupid: If there are multiple fires, all buses go to one fire and let every other place burn. Almost all buses go to one stop, then the next bus stop, etc. I had a line of about 15 buses once. P9: Cities failing to \u0027process\u0027 meaning you can choose to destroy and restart or let the server try to \u0027process\u0027 it to possibly fix it for... at least 12 hours, maybe more, maybe forever? P10: Firetrucks sometimes don\u0027t even leave the fire station when there are fires. No explanation... P11: Recyclying centers that just stop recycling. There is recyclable material, storage space to do it, but it just doesn\u0027t do any work. P12: I have a surplus of water, but multiple buildings have no water??? P13: Again, concurrency between cities: Some cities that have just appeared don\u0027t even show up on the region view, for maybe an hour or more. I want to play with my friends in real time, not waiting for updates like this. Anyway, I could go on, but I\u0027m on lunch break so I should wrap this up, but it seems like it COULD be a fun game. I haven\u0027t had any trouble with my own network, which I was actually expecting, I only have mild reservations against always-on DRM. But this thing is broken. Avoid it for at least a month I would say. The problem is I really want to enjoy it, and I do have fun between the times that I get really frustrated that this thing is released in this terrible state.… ",

This is, and should be a single player game; as its predecessors have always been. The game itself is actually very good, once you are able to log in of course. It\u0027s a very enjoyable simulation that could live up to its expectations. The new grid-less approach to organizing your city is simply amazing, as are the new features that the game has to offer. The only significant irk I have despite the ridiculous online connectivity requirement is that they should have named it Simtown, as you cannot actually create a city; the size constraints are simply too strict. Why can\u0027t I choose to build cities 4 or even 16 times the size of the football field that is provided? In short: It\u0027s a very good game; that has been destroyed by online connectivity requirements. Admittedly, the situation regarding the overflowing servers should be rectified, but as it stands it is unplayable. A game costing as much as this shouldn\u0027t suffer from these kind of launch issues; not after the debacle that was Diablo 3\u0027s launch.… ",

I loved the previous instalments of the series so had high hopes for this one, but sadly no cigar. Why the hell did they make this traditional single player game with a on-line requirement, that is not only a authentication server connection but an actual game server connection where the server capacity is clearly not enough to feed the demand, my first ever attempt to play was on the 7th EU launch day, and first try entry got in and the game told me i had timed out and told me to log back in. 2nd try the same server was suddenly full with a 19min queue, even though it shows green and not full in the list. 3rd attempt to play resulted in yet another time out due to the 15minute queue hurray! When I finally got to play the game it crashed in 20 min or so and back to the god damn queue. So my first thought on this new Sim City is a big WTF?!? where you smoking Maxis? Shame that so many critics based there review solely on the EA press version they got to play without the thousands of real players crammed on to the few servers. Would love to see the reviews if 90% of them would spend 30min or more in a queue to play for the review, and then have the game crash on them in 20min 3 hours repeatedly. I can already hear the lawyers over the pond getting ready to process the class-action lawsuit that this embarrassing excuse of a game will likely produce in true Americana style. Maybe we EU citizen should also put our class-action lawsuit powers in to good use here … ",

This is the direction games have been going for years. Get over the fact that you\u0027ll have a harder time downloading it from the pirate-bay. This is going to be one hell of a game. P.S. I also find it amusing that a game that has only been publicly available for a few hours has so many negative reviews. Why don\u0027t you actually try playing it first?… ",

EA, Blizzard, and Activision all need to go out of business, or break apart into smaller studios that were the source of their success.

What annoys me is not that EA seem overly obsessed with copy protection but that they have created a game that should be a single player game just like all the previous games. You should not have to login to a server to be able to play it. There are so many other ways of doing it that the fact they went in the direction they did cannot be defended. I hope reviewers slam the game based upon that because it isn\u0027t needed or wanted. You should get a simple code that you enter into Origin to register your game to your account and then do what you want, play offline if you want. Going this route is a step to far and is nothing more then wanting to spy on you and control what you do. It is more like a facebook system then a computer game. EA messed this one up badly.… ",

Having never written a review for Metacritic, SimCity has all but angered me to the point of voicing my opinion in a sea of others. I\u0027d generally say that writing a review on or very near launch day is counter-productive. There will always be server problems and 0 day bugs, but EA/Maxis/Origin have done an amazing job at an EPIC FAIL. I gave this some thought. How is it fair to rate an entire game based on server issues alone? My conclusion is this: How is it not? I paid for a game that requires an internet connection. Any idiot born since 1970 (or earlier) knows that means the game will require servers. Knowing this, the servers are an integral part of the package. They\u0027re just as essential as the premise, design and execution of the game play. Reasonable people should expect that a product they paid for should be available for use. Whether it be the first day or 3285th. Occasional server crashes and bugs are human error and random acts of electrons. 10s of thousands of Twitter reports and FB posts are something different. In my case, I was able to play once in 2 days of trying. In fact, I spent all day trying to play one damn time on any of the servers. I was not able to play. So, my review is hugely negative. If you think it\u0027s unfair to judge a game based on server problems, then you\u0027re entitled to your opinion. Me, I\u0027m tired of getting the run-around from mega-corporations and shareholders who only care about greed. I\u0027m sick of 1/2 baked excuses.

What I really hate about it is once they realize that keeping the game online is costing them more money than they tricked loyal SC fans out of, they just turn off the lights and we are out the $60-80. Frequent server drops and synch issues made it impossible to join public regions despite having access to a fiberoptic connection on the west coast. I didn\u0027t get the opportunity to participate in the betas or I probably would not have bought the game. Well played EA. Like many others here, my first impression of the game was a great big WTF!? The cities... err neighborhoods... are tiny and it really does feel like a facebook game. Gone are the custom maps and giant cities where you designed your own mass transit and raised your populations to huge numbers. If you enjoyed SC4 you probably wont like this game... I hate to say it but give Cities XL a go instead. I\u0027m usually very understanding of release or patch issues since I am a software developer/DBA myself, but the types and seriousness of problems I encountered really made me wonder if half the code was even tested. I imagine it was more like \"Hey we said March release, let\u0027s just put out what we have by then and deal with the fallout by using coyly worded press releases and ninja hotfixes\".… ",

Unlike the previous installments the player is givenThe best summation of the anticipated SimCity is this: It has potential but its problems far outweigh its majesty. The SimCity franchise has taken some of its former elements and brought them into a more modernized environment. I was ecstatic to see that the cities influencing the demands of its surrounding neighbors stuck around. Unlike the previous installments the player is given the opportunity to build roads that turn and work around the terrain as opposed to being pre-selected arraignments. While the terraform option had been removed the new layouts make it so that the challenge of working with the terrain offered is a more balanced challenge. Other benefits include not having to re-zone, and power lines, the staple that could make the ideal city a pile of garbage because there was not enough space to place power lines have been eliminated. While this simplifies construction it is one simplification that most would see as beneficial as opposed to detrimental. Unfortunately these few positives are the cushion for the detrimental amount of bugs, glitches, and server errors that come along with the game as is. As an individual I am adamant in stating that I am not a fan of \u0027Origin\u0027. To me I feel that it is the equivalent of Zune to Steam. So learning that I needed to install Origin to play this game was a disappointment but one that I could handle. As with any game that requires the use of proxy installer (Rockstar Social Club) it is a means to ensure that the product can not easily be hacked and illegally downloaded. This leads to problems in that it forces the consumer to have an active internet connection at all times in order to play. The reason I consider this a problem is that it forces the consumer to agree to two conditions. The first being that the game is designed and strongly encourages multi-player to get the full benefit of the game. The second is that if, for any reason, there is a problem with the developer\u0027s servers, the game can not be played. The game has been released for two days and this solitary problem is what has led to this title to lose virtually all credibility and anticipation that it built up prior to its release. At certain points one could find themselves stuck on the loader loading screen waiting while it searches for updates. Other times it freezes while it tries to authenticate with the server. Occasionally a message will pop up saying that the server is unavailable and to choose another one. Unfortunately that message will sometimes appear when all servers are down yet the availability says that they are all open. If/when one can get past the loader itself and access the game then a new nightmare begins when the consumer tries to create or join a game. Even though the game loaded and they are in the game the server may be down in which case you can neither create nor join a game. Because all of this is running through Origin half the time the status that Origin and the game itself conflicts with each other. Want to switch to another server since the current one is not working? That requires shutting down the game and going back to the loader where it begins again. Even when playing a region if the server disconnects any progress made from then on out is lost unless a connection is re-established. The last major problem is that, when trying to locate any information regarding server downtime or attempt to find any resolution there is difficulty as to where to go. I have attempted to go to EA to find that a message explaining the current issue is not there. I have gone to the official facebook page to find thousands of people demanding a refund. Twitter seems to give the updates but they are so sparse and vague that the only thing the player can hope for is that the problem will be resolved before the day is over. EA says that they are doing everything possible to allow people to play the game but since its debut SimCity has gone from a long anticipated follow up to a long running franchise to one of the biggest failures and a testament to the fact that when companies are more interested in making sure that they can control the rights of their property that bad things typically follow in its wake. EA can make promises but unless they can manage to fix their connectivity issues and address their dwindling fan base promptly and constantly I fear that this game will be one where, for one that promotes a healthy online community, there will not be one when the game is finally ready for a proper release.… ",

EA says they will give refunds in press release but you can always stop/dispute payment with your credit card for faulty product. Hurting EA\u0027s bottom line is the only way they will ever pay attention. The biggest problem is not the DRM but that you have to always play on a server. You log on to play a \"Single Player Game\" and if server is down you are out of luck. The sever goes down while you are playing and you cannot save losing your progress and you are out of luck. Server is busy and there is a wait line and nothing you can do. EA decides it doesn\u0027t want to support the server and gives 30 days notice that your game will break and you are out of luck. In addition the little bit of play time that I was able to do there seems to be holes/missing buildings and options in the game. I can only suspect that this will be the Sims 3 again costing several hundreds of dollars to own the complete game.

You can\u0027t place large highways, as they are part of the region and not the cities. No teraforming aside from changes due to civil construction. No Subways so you cant really have alternate transport in your city b/c the map is filled with roads occupying all the space. You literally fill the entire city limit in like 4 hours of play. Then you have to expand vertically after that. No agriculture industry, so clean industry is impossible until you get your tech up. I went back to Sim City 4 to get my fix, and I actually had fun offline. I did like the curved roads, but you cant put any in a city you want to expand, because the map size forces you to grid for efficiency. Now if you had the entire region to edit without switching views, this game may actually have its new features mean something. This day and age, that should be the scale of a Sim City game. Multiple cities all in the same editable instance. If the online requirement is why this was not done, then that was a bad choice and a significant failure for the SIm City franchise, however much I wish it wasn\u0027t so. If things change I\u0027ll update my score/edit post, but it\u0027ll need more than an offline mode to be sure.… ",

The effects and movements of all the tiny pieces on the ground are ultimately satisfying and fun to look at. In terms of sound, apart from being a siren simulator, the game is not much of an improvement over SimCity 4, but that is fine. Now I hear a lot of people saying that this SimCity is much harder than the older ones. This, ladies and gentlemen, is a false flag. I\u0027ve been able to make nearly 100k population cities in under an hour while maintaining over a 10k profit (that\u0027s including simoleons from specializations) to the point where I have nearly millions...and not really all that much to spend it on. In previous SimCity titles, your job never really felt complete. Now, you eventually build yourself up to the point where continuing is pointless and you are forced to move on to another small square. But this is where my biggest complaint lies. Ultimately, this SimCity is a simplified version of previous titles. There are no mass complicated regions and each square is its own independent city, although sims will commute to other cities to shop, work, etc. I also feel like I am having cooperation forced down my throat. I understand that they had a multiplayer vision for this game, but I think that vision is in no way true to that of SimCity. Not that SimCity cannot be multiplayer and even cooperative, but I think it should never have been dumbed down to the point of baby\u0027s first sim game while not even focusing on what made SimCity so captivating: that it was hard, expansive, and that it offered you huge options. Did you like thermoforming? Well, too bad, because that\u0027s gone...or did you like creating your own mass transit highways? Well...yeah, that\u0027s gone. Personally, I enjoyed being not a mayor of one square, but being a bunch of mayors and even God of the entire region. I could build entire regions by hand using terraforming tools and then start building small, huge, and everything in between cities. In terms of the always online feature, I have no qualms. I lived through the Diablo III launch and have come to expect this I suppose. But it is unfortunate that such a launch was, once again, handled so poorly. Not only that, but while Blizzard has probably the best forum service and PR I have seen, EA and Maxis have next to no PR and a poor forum system. Apart of what kept people on DIII is that Blizzard took a proactive stance in communicating to its buyers and still continues to work with players in order to deliver a better product, even after nearly almost a whole year. Ultimately, I believe SimCity has fallen victim to a type of mixing the complicated structure of SimCity with the simple and easy-to-access world of the Sims; to appearing hostile to long-time fans of SimCity; to over simplification; and to a poor launch, which it seems has solidified the opinions of many. Will Maxis and EA work together with fans to deliver the best SimCity they can, or will they fall short due to their poor PR or unwillingness to give fans what they want?… ",

I have gotten into a few games early in the morning, and they were wonderful. My only issue with the game itself is that city size is quite small, but it provides a challenge and i believe that Maxis will fix it eventually. However, EA needs to realize that this is an inexcusable situation. The fact that this game has a 1.7 right now is generous, as most people have been completely unable to play or have lost the cities that they worked for hours on. EA- Please, stop with your childish, anti-consumer tactics. No one likes you, always-on DRM, microtransactions, and especially Origin. No one does. Some people may feel \"meh\" towards them, but no one likes them. Its such a shame, because games like SimCity, Dead Space 3, Real Racing 3, and Battlefield 3 are legitimately fun games that are hampered by your pathetic services and even worse customer support. You leave consumers in a terrible situation, wanting to boycott your games but being unable to because if only you were not the publisher, people would be in love with many of them. I know the game will work eventually, and at that point id easily give it an 8 or 9. This is solely to drive the score down to make a point to EA that they must stop. And now Amazon stopped selling the game and youre disabling features? Come on, now. Heres to hoping for a better future.… ",

If you want to learn how to properly DRM a game, take a look at Steam. You DO need to connect to the internet to play a game, but once you log in, you have the option to play offline for up to 30 days, for if the server were to go down, or your internet. EA., Congratulations on having a worse release than Diablo 3.

I\u0027m sorry to say but I\u0027m super disappointed on this release. When I played the beta I thought they were doing fine and on the release week everything turned into a train rack. You can\u0027t connect to servers, I worked like 4 hours on a city and lost it, I did it again and lost it again, and it kept taking me to the tutorial every time I went back in the game. Of course my cities completely dissapear and this just sucks. I don\u0027t know how much of Maxis fault this is, but maybe Origin have something to do with it since when Battlefield 3 came out they had tons of errors and bugs too. They should at least have an offline option to play kind of like on BF3 right since this is telling us that servers will be down eventually since they also need maintenance, they can be hack, or maybe some kind of hardware problem. Well I hope this is a lesson learn for companies. The GAME: The graphics are cool, the game looks fun, and they improve in a lot of things. The things I don\u0027t like, unlike the past simcity you could built Highways, overamps, Subways, Farms, pipes, power lines and a million other options. Not to mention you could customize your terrain, have an extra large terrain and so on. NOW, all of those options are GONE!!!!! WTF!!! Anyways, I wish I could give them a good scoring since I pre-order the dam game and I had high expectations and you can find it online already cheaper than the pre-order. THEN END!… ",

For the couple of hours I managed to play, thus far, the game seemed fun. The visuals were gorgeous, especially some of the architecture of the shops and residences. The ability to specialize in trading or tourism etc. is an interesting feature which gives a city much needed income, especially due to the small map sizes. The biggest issue with the game is the online only DRM that the community complained about before release, predicting the failure of servers on launch (and into the future). All these predictions have come true. On launch day I managed a couple hours of play. Since then, the servers have been down or so full that I cannot connect. After years of MMO launches, it\u0027s mind boggling that a company would not over-prepare for the launch of a game that requires their servers to operate. As a consumer, it\u0027s insulting to pay money for a product only to be told that we cannot use it. As of right now, I\u0027d like a refund. Unfortunately, EA support also has queues of multiple hours due to the inadequacy of their preparation for this release. The game may be worth its price in a couple weeks, once these teething issues are sorted out. For now, avoid it. Do not waste your time or money on this product.… ",

When they say it\u0027s constantly online, they really mean it. It is NOT just log-in authentication DRM where you log into origin and are then allowed to play. Everything is stored server-side. While this mode (I say mode because I believe it should be one mode out of several choices) does offer something new in terms of potential with the global market (it is merely potential as inter-regional trade is actually buggy and poor performance), it creates many more problems. The most heinous is the lack of ability to play at all because their servers are overloaded. It also means that you can\u0027t play in a bubble. You are forced to rely on the play of others. This means that if your neighbor messes up, and you were relying on them because you thought it\u0027d be interesting to take advantage of the trade features, you are equally screwed. While the servers are cross-regional, your city is held to one specific server. If your server is full, you either can\u0027t play, or you\u0027re forced to start a new city in a different region. This will lead to ghost cities popping up, which hurts the game for the surrounding cities. Many tools that are in SC4 that made city management easier are missing, making micromanagement tedious. They\u0027ve made transportation terrible since there\u0027s no proper pathfinding to choose fastest route, just shortest. This means you can\u0027t set up main roads and side streets. Everything needs to be the maximum road because otherwise your sims will try to get from one place to another using the side streets. This is obviously very expensive. There are no highways to be built, the best you get are the avenues. People are hypersensitive to crime. One crime a week is considered crazy and terrible, and it plummets property value. When something stops working, there\u0027s no easy way to figure out what exactly the problem is. Also, you can\u0027t save and experiment. If you want to experiment, you have to start an entirely new city. There\u0027s no saving and then creating a series of disasters just to see if your city can handle it, then loading after having a chuckle. The map sizes are also pitifully small. If I am ever allowed to play for a significant period of time, I feel I could fill it up entirely within one day of playing. The game is also plagued by bugs, but that\u0027s come to be expected with games on launch. My only concern regarding them is the game\u0027s online has created so many problems, fixes for the bugs may be slow in coming. While the online mode potentially adds to the game, it\u0027s poorly executed and causes more problems than anything else. The rest of the game is a step backwards, with many losses in quality of life features. My rating for this game is 0, simply because it\u0027s unplayable. If it weren\u0027t for that issue, it would garner a robust 4.… ",

Four hours wasted, enduring \u0027updates\u0027, \u0027authentication attempts\u0027 and looking at a blank tutorial map where you can\u0027t click on anything. Making the servers so integral to a single player experience is clearly a move to benefit publishers by reducing theft I get it. But that brings with it a trust element that sufficient infrastructure will be bought to support it. I paid $100 Aust for this, that\u0027s US$103. I\u0027d think that would give them enough revenue to allocate server time for it to accept my connection The game itself looks ok, graphics are quite nice but textures become very fuzzy on zoom. I was told you could zoom to any sim and see what they are up to KIND OF, but of course normally they are in their houses and there seems to be no way to see what they are doing (or how many are inside) there. The severely restricted city size is worse than I\u0027d thought. I think the specialisation idea has some merit, but if you want to specialise in oil for example, you must set your whole map up to maximise that benefit which leaves your overall layout suboptimal. Not ideal. I and others relished the \u0027constant expansion\u0027 you could achieve with the old simcity games, and that\u0027s gone now. It\u0027s zoomed in a level toward the \u0027sims\u0027 concept, which is one I never embraced. Things like openttd (the free transport tycoon project) are much more loved and have much more depth despite their lesser appearance. Wish I\u0027d saved my $100. This stuff isn\u0027t hard if demand was an issue, they could have progressively allowed people onto the servers, or staggered each country\u0027s release date. They didn\u0027t do that and must accept these reviews which reflect peoples experience of what they\u0027ve created.… ",

I\u0027d love to rate this game higher than a 0 but after 36 hrs of trying to log in I\u0027ve been able to do little more than get to the title screen. The launch thus far has been an absolute disgrace. To start with it took over 3 hours just to kick off the download for the game which should\u0027ve been pre-loaded days a head of time. Servers have been down consistently since the launch making it impossible to get into this single player game. Rather than overestimate the number of servers needed to launch they low balled it and so tens if not hundreds of thousands of players are trying to log into two servers setup for the NA launch. Other servers exist for Europe and Asia but they are equally jammed, and will in all doubt get worse as other international releases take place without additional servers allocated. Furthermore cities setup in these regions can not be accessed from other server regions once things calm down, and who wants to be playing from a server ten thousand miles away. The game looks like it could be fun despite the smaller maps, lack of subways, terraforming and numerous other things removed from the previous version but at this point I can not even give my honest opinion on these things. It has been a long while since I\u0027ve seen a game launch so thoroughly mismanaged. I can accept a couple patches or instabilities the first few days, but not complete inability to play whatsoever. If I am unable to get in to play by the end of today i will be back-charging my credit card and finding something else to spend my $60 on.… ",

In the same way that if a game has a bug, it can rightly factor in to your review. The game play is good, but not earth-shattering. The mechanics are polished but \u0027softened\u0027 enough that veteran players may feel unattended to. Not getting to play a game that I purchased because of issues I have no culpability for, is NOT okay. As consumers, we continue to capitulate more and more and accept this as standard practice. We shouldn\u0027t. This is ESPECIALLY true when they make no attempt to compensate you for lapses: \"Couldn\u0027t play for a week? Here\u0027s a free dlc item.\" Ultimately we continue to send a message that we will digest anything regardless of the flaws. I\u0027m sorry but an amusing game in no way makes up for a product that is too broken to properly work. All moral context aside, my score is a reflection of SERVICE LEVELS and GAMEPLAY combined.

I have used metacritic for years to get info on games and to help me make informed decisions on purchases, so that I buy games that are worth my time and that I don\u0027t waste money on them. The case with SimCity is really the tale of two situations. One the Critic Reviews are skewed since they were able to play the game before the masses. While obviously the game seems to operate well when the population is small, that is not the case for the end-user. Now you can take this review as just me venting my frustration, but how as a consumer am I supposed to make educated and informed decisions when a Critic review is false. Now I\u0027m not blaming the Critics. In no way are they at fault for the reviews, but I do think they should be allowed to re-review the game in it\u0027s current live state. So what exactly is the games problem... almost everything. Since they decided to take the ALL online route, that seems be growing in popularity, the game needs the online component to even work. Including a OFFLINE mode option, was not even included for individuals who maybe wanted to just play the game the way SimCity was originally created to be as a giant open sandbox of city building amazement. Now before you say \"well go play the original game! It\u0027s still there!\", that doesn\u0027t excuse the fact that people spent anywhere from 40$ to 80$ depending on where and when you purchased the game and what edition you purchased. The game is almost completely un-playable. The server errors include everything from unable to connect/load to completely erasing everything you just did in the last few hours. Social features. The key component to the online only part, and these features don\u0027t work. It takes forever for anything to update. I spent over an hour last night attempting to invite an individual to the region I was playing in, since it took an entire hour for them to show up. Achievements and accomplishments are server specific. So if I take the publisher\u0027s advice and move to another less populated server then all my previous accomplishments are gone, and only exist on the previous server. The positives. The game actually has many, but sadly they don\u0027t work since the entire game has failed to launch properly. In a technological age where things like this could have been easily avoided (Hello worthless three public betas), it makes no sense as to how something like this could have happened. When the game does work though, it provides great entertainment and the region aspect (again when it works) is an exciting feature and brings a whole new dynamic to the game many of us grew up to love. (To bad they didn\u0027t really how many of us grew up loving this game) My review will stand on this game. I planned to call friends to play or go purchase the game, or encourage them to jump in, but now I won\u0027t even mention I wasted my time playing it or attempting to. On top of that why invite more friends? The game can\u0027t handle more players, in fact I hope all my friends stop playing just so a little more server space will remain for me. If you buy this game, actually if you even spend a penny on this game you wasted your money. If some one gives it to you for free... you will lose money since time is money and all this game does is waste time with you looking at error screens and loading screens.… ",

Are they seriously keeping people from just installing this thing and playing with no worries? Is your internet up? Do the servers have room? Did you city even save?

Nope. Thats it. All the land you get. So you have to start demolishing entire blocks to deal with the never ending need for more fire stantions and water treatment plants. I had 6 fire stations (mostly upgraded) on that little plot of land and they were still complaining at me. I won\u0027t even go into the lack of subways and pipe laying.. heh heh. All puns aside, this was a pretty big disappointment..... Not even to mention I CANT EVEN PLAY NOW!! EA.. you s**k. Youre a greedy corporation that wants to rob gamers of the exact reason you are in business. I will happily seek a pirated version of this and wont be spending anymore money on your products. I would say I am going to seek a refund, but we all know that won\u0027t happen. I will just delete my account and wait for somebody to upload an offline, and more importantly, playable version. Maxis, you should have known better. I mean come on. To develop such a devoted following and in one fell swoop piss 99% of them off.

Many people, even reviewers, were unable to access their games or load old saves because this. As a consumer, we should have a zero-tolerance for this sort of practice and boycott any game which is essentially an $80 rental. As to the content of the game, the city plots are abysmal in size, deals with neighboring cities is done automatically, connections with other cities (highways and rails) is done automatically, and much content like subway stations have been cut. The overall nature of the game is so limited that it when taken into context with it\u0027s social gaming aspects, you have to conclude that would be better fit for a facebook or iphone game.… ",

Switching from city to city takes so long that it really makes trying to play this in single player overly frustrating. From what I\u0027ve been able to see, there are some interesting little things they\u0027ve put into the game that could make SimCity more fun to play, but at the same time it feels to easy now. Part of why I loved SimCity was the challenge it gave me in creating and designing a living and breathing city. I wish I could of played it more so that I could have a more in-depth feel for this game, but the constant server issues have me so frustrated I do wish I could take the game back and get a refund. All I can really do now is that hope that someday in the future they add in some sort of offline mode (not holding my breath there) and that in the next few days they manage to fix all the issues that keep me and others from even being able to play the thing. Until then, I unfortunately have to give it a 3.

There\u0027s no organic life to them like in prior SimCity games or even more recent independent entries in city simulation like CitiesXL (for all its warts).

Oh, and the ability to upgrade your buildings, well that\u0027s pretty sweet; not enough fire coverage in your city?

One can trust this is one the \"base game\" in a series, with many expansions to come. There seems to be little to no role for the modding community in SimCity, although that remains to be seen, due to the online-only DRM and the multiplayer component. What is gone in SimCity is the sense of game that might ever become a long-lived classic such as SimCity 2000 or SimCity 4. SimCity is a great game that many players will enjoy, but its faults in terms of the way it is framed tend outweigh the great craftsmanship of the game itself. Server trouble at launch will no doubt dissipate in the coming weeks, though that\u0027s hardly an excuse for the debacle surrounding this game\u0027s launch. Like Spore, another rather tragic release from Maxis that will sell, but will also stand testament to a much better game prevented from coming into fruition by poor design and marketing choices.… ",

One of the biggest changes to Simcity in this version is the \u0027Always On\u0027 gameplay, requiring the player to have a constant internet connection and the servers to handle all players. Sadly, at least at launch, the game has been overloaded with eager players who are disappointed by the lack of planning on the part of the developers to anticipate the demand for their product, and the lack of an expedient response in correcting the situation. As a player this makes you question the longevity of the game as well. In the past, you could play a Simcity game for years past its prime (indeed many people still play Simcity 4 which is a decade old now!) but what happens when it no longer becomes economically justifiable for EA to operate these new Simcity servers ? Furthermore, an \u0027Always on\u0027 type system suggests a game that will have a basis in microtransactions. This sort of thing is inevitable as a way to finance the continued operation of the servers, but clearly at the expense of the player. You have to question how this effects gameplay balance and if balance will be tossed out the window in the name of profit ? Only time will tell the fate of this game, but for now when you can get in at least enjoy it for what it is as long as you can.… ",

But for me, what really kills this game from the beginning is the lack of a real map size. The current city plot size is just a joke. And its not only about simulation restrictions; EA/Maxis choose the poorest idea to keep performance at bay, by limiting physical size. Even if i wish to build a city with a lot of aesthetics, like avenues, curved roads, bridges, and so, i could not, because the space is so small. I cant even have farmland. That certainly wouldn\u0027t press performance, a lot of space with farms, but thay choose the size way, and i fear the reason was purely to charge for bigger plots. They could perfectly managed the \"performance issues\" with sims limit on city, blocking immigration, or even restrict the city to a certain number of buildings, but they choose to limit the size of the map, what is really dull. Plus, there is zero terraform options, so the game is essentially a simulator, constricted by what EA wishes, and we basically administrate some kind of pet cities that are limited by a magical barrier. Tunnels? Bridges? Anyone? No, basically the maps are just simple squares. Hell, if at least i could have some realistic tiny plots of land, shaped by some \"natural limits\" it wouldn\u0027t feel so empty. I have other minor complaints, like low graphic quality, and over cartunesque style, but i could even cope with that. But the city limitation is a real deal breaker for me. If you see people with reviews at 10 or 9, telling you \"its fun and this is all that matters\" are the same people that probably will find Farmville or any facebook game \"fun and addictive\". It will hit high for casual gamers. Anyone who really played some serious sim like previous sims will not have the same kind of opinion.… ",

What kills the game however is the everything besides the actual ingame content. What enraged me to the point of physical arm waving was the fact that you had to be connected to the internet EVERY SINGLE MINUTE YOU PLAY THIS GAME. Combine this with highly unstable servers(And my router sometimes failing on me) resulted in me tens of times being trapped in the tutorial without being able to do anything, NOR GO AND PLAY THE REAL F*CKING GAME! But thats not all! Turns out that if you get disconnected during your gaming session your game might not be saved, which means that several hours of work suddenly goes down the drain. And to top the whole thing off: YOU CAN\u0027T SAVE THE GAMES YOURSELF! The only thing that made me feel marginally better was the fact that thousands of others expressed their fury online. I recommend you all to rather wait for a pirated version where you CAN ATLEAST PLAY OFFLINE, rather than buying this smoking pile of animal dung. But don\u0027t take my word for it, just have a chat with one (or all) of the thousands of other gamers who seem to agree with me.… ",

Besides the server issues happening at the time of this review, 122 hours after North American launch, the game is limited. The size of cities is so much smaller than previous versions, which is weird because with video games I am use to them improving over the course of a series, not getting worse and removing features. Speaking of removed features, build a road at the edge of your map, nothing happens, in Sim City 4 it prompted if you wanted to connect this to the neighboring city, not allowed here. Heck you can\u0027t even connect a subway to anything, cuz they simply don\u0027t exist, that\u0027s right, the lifeblood of every major city in the world is completely removed for Sim City. Sadly my friends and I believe that this was not included so as to be added as paid DLC at a later date. Similarly the small city size and lack of terraforming, a huge part of previous versions, limits the ability to do anything creative, which is what this series is about, again my friends and I believe these may be changed via paid DLC, which would be a complete disservice to fans and a giant step back for games in general as they get better and improve on previous features of a series, not remove the popular features, like playing a single player without having to be connected to the internet at all times, and change the principals of the series to the point of making the game unplayable, literally. The worst part is that when I have been able to connect to their servers and join a friend\u0027s region they start to purchase some of my excess power and then inexplicably my power plant continues to feed my city uninterrupted, yet stops giving him anything, even though I have five times the excess power than he needs, blame this on the servers if you want, but we are playing on the same server at the same time and talking on skype, which brings me to another drawback, how do you not include something other than a basic text chat in a game that requires you to be online. If my friend is having a zombie outbreak and needs police assistance he\u0027s not going to stop everything, let the zombies continue to destroy his city, or rather town considering the size limitation, he is going to try to do his best, but if all he had to do was ask us for help using his voice we can send any and all spare resources to assist him, but you can\u0027t reasonably expect a $60 online game to include simple communication tools. While they may fix their server issues, EA\u0027s what to get back in our \"good graces\" and still \"be friends\" is offering me a free Origin game, funny thing is I can\u0027t play the one and only Origin game I care to play, so why would I want to use another one of your games? The absolute worst part about this game is how a series that has been played offline for almost 25 years, except for Sim City 2000 Network Edition (a little known spinoff) no requires EA servers, so if I want to play this game in 5, 8, 10 years, as is my case with older Sim City games, I probably won\u0027t be able to as EA loves to shut down servers as they release the next game in a series or 2 years in a game\u0027s life span, sadly most of those games are still playable in the single player mode, which this simply doesn\u0027t offer, at least not without a major patch, that will probably never be released. Which probably accurately describes the venom many people have for EA and Maxis right now, it too will never be released, at least until they change menu system of the game as too many of us are all too familiar with the plane that\u0027s stuck in mid-air while we hope to find a working server. I\u0027d love to give this game a 0, but the few moments I have been able to play and not rebuild the last 3 hours of unsaved work the game has been one of the best experiences I\u0027ve ever had, so for the potential of playing it I\u0027ll give it a lowly single solitary one, which is exactly the amount of players it takes to play this game.… ",

If you do have 99.8%+ Internet connection quality, you will still lose everything because the EA servers will become \"overloaded\" and shut down. That\u0027s where you are forced to save everything. You might be lucky to connect to a different server, but you must REDO EVERYTHING because data does not synchronize between servers. That includes the tutorial. Like starting a brand new game. God awful launch and DRM and design. Epic fail for EA and Maxis. I heard SimCity had new disasters. Pretty much everything about it.… ",

There were many features that were central to the SimCity franchise that got cut out in the name of \"streamlining\" i.e. plan your own highway off-ramp locations, tiny plot size, terraforming, etc. Sure, the much-vaunted Glassbox simulation engine that tracks the activity of every individual sim promises a more \"accurate simulation\", but it\u0027s moot when so many aspects of the game\u0027s AI behave like retards. Traffic goes into a standstill even if you spend 75% of your budget on public transport if you commit the crime of having more than 5 intersections in your main arteries. Someone even proved how pants-on-head retarded the traffic AI is by making a city out of one single winding snake road spread out across the lot, and managed to have a successful city because of it because 0 intersections 0 gridlock. vOv I really want to like the game and the synergy it promotes, but unfortunately there are many things that need to be done for the game to be a success. The Always-Online system is not necessarily a DRM, but also something in-built to the game that had poorly thought-out execution. It failed to account for the contingency that someone\u0027s game would disconnect, and does not have an offline save that could be uploaded to the cloud the next time the player reconnects to the server (Diablo III and StarCraft II had that, at least). EA/Maxis also failed to properly stress test in their popular beta stages, and additionally they were piss poor in their communication to their players when they were attempting to sort out their server woes. On top of the always-online stuff, the game itself is in need of a significant overhaul. Traffic AI needs to be fixed. The RCI indicator is a lie after 2 days of playing and finding out that zoning according to the RCI indicator did nothing for my economy, I clicked on my population window and found everything I needed to know in the detail tab. I then decided to ignore everything the game was telling me through RCI and the ingame prompts, and did much better in my subsequent cities. There are just way too many aspects of the game that were either because of poor design decisions and poor execution that kind of border on amateurish. Somehow, I think that this SimCity 2013 has become a deeply wounding blow to Maxis\u0027s reputation. Lots of fanbois will protest and say that Maxis is perfect, and EA is at fault. But I\u0027ve been observing this game for a long time, and Maxis is just as complicit as EA in this, from the Online Lead being a Maxis staffer to Maxis designers themselves who wanted the always-online concept to begin with. Lots of people who have been playing Maxis games since the 90s have since lost their trust in Maxis, and it can only go downhill from here.… ",

Let\u0027s face it, this has all been said before and this poor review will boil down to server issues. It\u0027s a shame that this launch was handled so poorly. Not just that I couldn\u0027t log in to play the game, but that everyone from Maxis was so quiet about what was going on. When you have upset customers, the last thing you want to do as a company is remain silent. After trying this afternoon and evening to get on the servers once again, and still failing despite adding nearly twice as many servers as a couple days ago, I gave up. The silver lining in this whole thing is that Amazon stepped up to bat for me. They gave me a full refund, and apologized for my experience with this game. That\u0027s more than I\u0027ve heard from people who have ordered this game from Origin. At best they get a customer service rep who is nice enough to refund them, most likely they get one who flat out refuses to refund the money and at worst they (supposedly) threaten a ban of the entire Origin account. It\u0027s a shame that such a big company cannot treat its customers better. Maxis has lost a loyal customer here, and EA has lost any business from a formerly neutral customer, now anti-fanboy.… ",

As a longtime SimCity fan who\u0027s played every iteration of the game, though, going back to Will Wright\u0027s original classic, it truly pains me to say I still cannot recommend this game. The city size issue mentioned by many here is actually not new, but it\u0027s become so bad that it actually undermines the core premise of the game (that one is simulating a \"city\"). I can still recall being disappointed at how small SimCity 4\u0027s city areas seemed relative to SimCity 3000, but here the typical \"city\" is, without exaggeration, neighborhood-size. At 2x2 km, a typical city lot is slightly larger than Park Slope in Brooklyn, assuming there is no water or other unbuildable terrain. Truth be told, SimCity never handled scale all that well, but with these dimensions, the very notion of mass transit itself becomes absurd, as a pedestrian could walk across the city in a matter of minutes. It\u0027s little wonder that agricultural zoning and subways have disappeared. The cities are simply too small for them. This alone is enough to severely limit the appeal of the game to me, but the regional system, too, is poorly implemented. The essence of SimCity was, after all, always the Mayorship, and the Mayor\u0027s authority extends only to the borders of his city. Attempting to create regional economies and specializations, where players are forced to constantly deal with neighbors (whether in multiplayer or single-player) ultimately detracts from the experience, IMO. This is not SimCounty or SimState or SimRegionalEconomicPartnership, it\u0027s SimCity! The scale and shape of the cities, moreover, makes the \"regions\" appear quite ridiculous and not at all realistic. Zoning, a core element of the game, has been given an overhaul, but not for the better. Previous versions built in infrastructure cost as part of the zoning itself (higher densities cost more to zone), but did not care what size street they fronted. Here, zoning is free, but all depends on the type of fronting street. This makes it impossible to construct anything like Lower Manhattan or downtown Boston. Your options are basically Phoenix, Las Vegas or Houston, on a tiny scale. The streets can be curvy now, yes, but since building lots remain square (was it really that hard to snap lots and buildings to irregular spaces?), this produces a tremendous amount of wasted space. The time scale of SimCity was always perplexing, with the early emphasis on dirty industry, later transitioning to electronics and white collar services, suggestive of a starting point during the industrial revolution and moving through the late 20th century (I believe SC 2000 had a possible starting year of 1900 A.D., though contemporary tech was always available, and culminated with futuristic arcologies). The tantalizing possibilities of building a game that captures the sweep of urban history in this manner, a sort of Civilization of city-building, has been left unexplored here. Instead, the player lives in a perpetual now, with only a handful of technological enhancements here and there. About the AI, many uncomplimentary things could be said. Multiple fire trucks respond to a single modest house fire even as a wall of flame sweeps through the industrial district. Residents make contradictory statements about their proximity to shopping. And so on. I\u0027m trying to think of a few positive things to say here, and I do like the option of simply adding on to, rather than demolishing and rebuilding, certain buildings. The graphics are attractive enough, if a bit cartoony. Overall, though, it\u0027s just not a step up from SC 4, or even from the two before it. Did fans really wait 10 years for this? Perhaps Maxis can, in time, mend some of the flaws. Others are here to stay, reflective of what looks like a long-term shift away from single-player in-depth games to a ones better suited to an era of smart phones and short attention spans. For SimCity, though, one of the ultimate time wasters and friend to micromanagers everywhere, that design imperative may very well be fatal to the venerable franchise.… ",

City lots are small, much of your choices are limited to \"Doesn\u0027t do much\" and \"Does a all you can ask but costs a fortune\" with limited middle ground. Options are also highly limited for what I had expected. Simulation aspects frequently fail. With one city having industry begging for workers, but a solid mix of all 3 wealth classes of residential each begging for jobs in a city with nearly zero traffic problems and solid public transit?… ",

HavingSim City has really flopped, even if you remove the server issues from the equation. I feel really bad for the guys at Maxis who had to make the game like this, I have a feeling that it wasn\u0027t their decision. Over the last two days I\u0027ve managed to play for about 10 hours on the Europe West 2 server despite the horrible server problems, and I\u0027m already getting bored with the game. Having spent thousands of hours to all of the previous versions of Sim City, that is a surprise I didn\u0027t expect when paying 60€ for the game. At 6€/h that is a pretty steep price for two frustrating days of queuing to the servers and constantly being afraid to loose your progress. Severe points reduction from the city sizes that are probably the most crippling aspect of this game. The current map is full to the edges after only few hours of play and you get a claustrophobic feeling in the game with no space to expand. Moving to second region just postpones it a few hours and frustration returns even stronger when it also runs out of space. Your city looks like a downtown of a real city that\u0027s cut out from a larger entity with real suburbs and all that nice surrounding built area. Developers say that the choice was made so that even low end PCs could play the game. I don\u0027t understand why they couldn\u0027t use the same approach that has been taken in Sim City 4: variable size maps. You just pick the map that your PC can handle when it\u0027s maxed out and that\u0027s it. If the choice was too large one, try again with a smaller one. Problem solved. It\u0027s annoying how the developers are trying to explain away design decisions with \"pretend logic\" and hoping that players don\u0027t notice. I\u0027m guessing most likely the orders came from above to limit the city sizes for some future DLC release. Or some other crap like that. I just want to refuse to believe a serious game designer wouldn\u0027t notice how much the city size limit affects the game experience. Lots of minus from roads, somehow all the fun is missing from building the roads because of the minuscule city sizes and lack of choice on how to connect to neighboring cities. That\u0027s a shame because building roads and designing road networks has always been one of the key aspects of Sim City. It\u0027s also annoying how you have to upgrade all your roads to high density because otherwise your city just won\u0027t grow in population, and then you have a city with only high buildings. Having the curvy roads is great, but doesn\u0027t compensate for all the other lacks. To add insult to injury, there is the always on DRM that doesn\u0027t let me choose when to save regions, or allow me to reload regions at previous states. I don\u0027t have possession of my own save games from private region where I\u0027m the only player. The pollution that crosses city boundaries into neighboring cities and abandoned city slots pretty much guarantees that I have no intention to play on public regions where I can\u0027t control actions of the other cities. The game is pretty and smooth, credits for that. The simulation engine seems to work nicely. But I\u0027m not going to spend hundreds of hours to this game just because it looks pretty and I can follow each Sim around in the city. It must be fun to play, the City Building must be the primary activity and the current version just isn\u0027t any of that. Many of official reviews said the game is a lot of fun. I disagree. Looking at how EA did their calculations about the required amount of servers to support their player base, it seems that they need at least 4-8 times more server capacity to do the job than estimated. After the doubling of the initial capacity that I\u0027ve seen today, the servers are still completely bogged even with the cheetah speed and game features disabled. So here\u0027s an interesting thought to ponder: How much is EA willing to spend on running these servers for an extended period? How many hours of server time at amazon did my 60€ buy? At what point is EA going to decide that it\u0027s time to pull the plug or they will start loosing money for every hour I spend on this game? Their initial estimates on the server costs were 4-8 times under the mark, and you can bet your house on it that EA is not going to allow Sim City to add to the red side of their balance sheet if the investors have any say on it. Be prepared to make a door stop from your Sim City DVD much sooner than you thought, this one is not going to be kicking for 10 years like it\u0027s predecessor. Please, don\u0027t repeat my mistake and support this horrible business model of always on-line single player games that pretend to be serious multi-player games to get your moneys. I would ask for my money back, but apparently EA doesn\u0027t refund games bought from Origin. Thanks EA for ruining Sim City.… ",

Overlooking all of that, the game, for the 45 minutes I\u0027ve been able to play, is fun and the graphics are nice. The only reason I gave this game a 3 is because some poor peon at EA has slaved away to make this, for that he or she deserves some recognition.… ",

From tiny maps that are not even a fraction of the size of SimCity2000 and artificially scarce resources meant to push this \"connective\" social experience (meant to justify the always online DRM), the game is simply terrible. Gone are features like subways and pipe laying to make your town more efficient, and the ability to save games or go back to old saves... introduced are hours-long waits to connect to DRM servers, random city deletion from their servers, and excuse after excuse as to how the always-online feature would make the game better if you could play it. It might merit a 1 on any other day, but EA/Origins is denying customers who bought directly a refund, if you purchased from Amazon or anywhere else, you\u0027re in luck, but if you bought the game directly from the maker... they want you to be far more patient with demanding a refund than they were with charging you for their non-functional product. Between the abject failure of the game and the absolutely terrible customer service, my only regret is that I cannot give this game a negative score. Not only have I not enjoyed it, purchasing this game has caused considerable stress and frustration as I either waited to play or waited on the phone with my bank to get the chargeback. This experience has been so awful that not only would I not recommend purchasing this particular title, I would strongly urge readers to not purchase anything from EA ever again.… ",

I was able play without issue for 10 hours or so before the infamous server crash. I was actually in game when the crash was starting to unfold and could see a \"searching for connection\" bubble fruitlessly searching for a connection like a bar fly searching for love at closing time. A friend called and asked if I was in game and I said yes but no for long apparently. He recommended I say a eulogy for my city as it would be going into the cyber graveyard very soon. I haven\u0027t connected since the issue but I\u0027m hearing there\u0027s a lot of changes to the game and apparently they\u0027re not fixes but features being scaled to limit strain on the servers? I haven\u0027t experienced them for myself so I\u0027m not really sure. What I can do is give feedback from the 10 or so hours I have dedicated to this game and the bottom line is it\u0027s mediocre at best and at worst a disaster and a plague upon the Maxis house. The Good: I\"m racking my brain here but maybe the graphics? I don\u0027t know they look kind of cartoonish to me. Upgrade roads feature Curved roads The Bad: No offline single-player (there is, or at least was, an option to create a private region while playing online.) No Terra-forming. No more creating custom terrain that you can be proud of. Always have to be online to play. Sim City is traditionally a game you spend hours upon hours playing by by yourself so why do I have to be online when I\u0027m not, and don\u0027t want to be, interacting with other mayors. No local saving. If the server issues are ever fixed how many people are going to lose saves and hours of work due to a saving error. You can see this one coming a mile away. City size (or lack thereof) In the last Sim City you can spend hours, days, months, and even years carefully building, destroying and rebuilding your mega-cities in huge regions. Now in only a matter of hours you can use up all your land and you\u0027re left scratching your head saying \"what\u0027s next?\" I\u0027m sure this space constraint is also a result of this DRM EA is pushing. All the more reason we should have an offline single-player mode and with huge regions. In fact for the money that was spent by folks it shouldn\u0027t be a suggestion it should be a demand. I\u0027m sure there are a few more positives, and a lot more negatives, but the bottom line is EA missed the mark with this game big time and tarnished a great franchise. Will I keep playing the game? Maybe if I can connect but even then I see the staying power of this game won\u0027t last long. I\u0027ll be reinstalling Sim City 4 on my PC once again!… ",

I live in a rural area and the occasional drop in connection is expected, losing work to server issues is frustrating. Thankfully I purchased through Amazon and got my refund. The graphics are good and when it works it was ok. Launch issues, limited size, and the likelihood of paying to increase that size through DLC, limited life of the game, and terrible communication by EA are the reason for my rating. I won\u0027t complain about the DRM masked as multi-player/server side processing, but that isn\u0027t a plus.

I understand that people are disappointed/mad. I am DEFINITELY disappointed/mad. But the game is FANTASTIC! It\u0027s a brilliant update of the core game and genre to current-day parameters. The ambitions to create a shared experience is something I always wanted to see in SC4, and the ability to manage some (or all) of the cities in a region is exactly what I loved doing in that older iteration (one town for dirty industry, one for tech, one for dense commercial, etc.). Origin/EA has done a mortifying job unrolling a very ambitious project. Surely they should provide all who purchased the game ahead-of-time some sort of consolation, even if it\u0027s just token in size. Upgrade us all to deluxe, or give us credits to buy future DLC. Anything! HAVING SAID THIS: I feel terrible for everyone who made this game and has worked to get the servers optimized. How affected are our lives, really? The creators and administrators (not to mention the PR reps) are A) pariahs to the entire gaming community, B) working as hard as they can to fix the problems (albeit way too little, too late) C) soon to be out of a job (some will be black-sheeped for it all, of course). Again, what is that pain against our minor-to-moderate annoyance? Long-winded way to say: Please rate the game, not the way the launch has gone.

Launch here in Europe just like America has been one big joke, a joke played by the DEVS from Maxis and EA buisness managers that must be laughing their heads off with all the coming in. Yet whats the problem with this game. First, because EA want you to be forced to logon to their servers for DRM checking you cant ACTUALLY logon. Why? Because EA didn\u0027t provide enough SERVERS for the game. they claim they are fixing the issue yet at 1940PM on launch day NOT ONE single apology has been provided by EA MAXIS to the gamers out here wanting to play! BE WARNED DO NOT BUY THIS GAME STOP BUYING EA GAMES PERIOD. Until us the gamers revolt and stop putting cash into EA will they stop treating us like this. Everyone demand refunds, if none provided start Suing them… ",

Folks say that you should review a game based on the gameplay itself, but the gameplay hinges on being able to connect to a server. EA said it was part of the experience. The start menu is part of the experience for most video games. If you were stuck at the start menu forever, then the game would get poor reviews because it\u0027s broken. People are stuck at what is essentially the start menu for SimCity, so, in its current sate, it is broken. I can see this turning into a case study for future game design students and developers on how not to run your business. The fall of EA (hopefully) would only validate the entire thing. Do yourself a favor and save your money unless they magically make an offline version or update for it. I had originally written a positive review, but I felt compelled to come back and replace it with this one because I couldn\u0027t stand the feeling of betrayal anymore. I really want to like the game, but I\u0027m tired of looking like an idiot trying to defend it despite everything that has happened.

The ***g a m e*** is not really a sequel to previous SimCity to my point of view, I mean it breaks lots of classical rule the previous one established, its kind of a revolution in the series... not a evolution. That\u0027s why you see so many simfans lobbying here. But the game is really fun once you accept the fact that they used SimCity franchise to make something different. To my point of view, its less realistic visually than the previous game. But... the gameplay is incredible. You have to plan more, use more collaboration of other cities, and your cities is confront to organic like challenges... your cities is making huge profit based on coal industries? Don\u0027t sit on your back like previous SimCity, cause one day your cities mines will run out of coal... So as a mayer its your role to plan a head for the transition... Much more challenging than previous SimCity. You cant save your city Haha, even better you must think of your choice. Critics about the map size didn\u0027t realize they where playing another game than SimCity. Small size cities is really important for the balance of this game. You have to manage your ressources, large land would screw this charming mechanic, cause otherwise, even if the coal or ore is vanish from your city you wouldn\u0027t care cause you simply would have build everything. SimCity 5 looks a bit like RTS strategy game, except this is to build with others. The challenges of gathering all the ressources for a great work is also very nice. Compare to SimCity 5, SimCity 4 was like painting a city while the new one is planning it. Once you started playing with the specialisation, this game really hook you. I thanks the team behind the game for having the gots not to follow everyone opinion (which shows they don\u0027t just want your money) and make a nice piece of art with this game. But be aware if you buy the game early, the macroeconomics severs are being hammered hard, and they probably waited to the last minute before plopping enough server So yes, there is a lot of disconnect and waiting right now, and yes this is really annoying.… ",

Sim City has a forced DRM something EVERYONE knew for a while now. This is bad to a stage where I haven\u0027t been able to run my game in 2 days. I got as far as claiming my city and playing 5 min past tutorial when server disconnected. I CANT LIVE WITH THAT, early days are always hectic I o not approve of always on DRM and I even hate it but I will not mar Sim City low for that as I knew what I was getting into. THE BAD PART is that this is not Sim City, game is dumbed down from the start and city squares are so TINY that this can\u0027t even be called Sim Town but merely a Sim Village. If the game was called something along the lines of Sims 3 Societies I am sure people wouldn\u0027t mind as it would attract a different type of players but for the love of what\u0027s sacred to you PLEASE do not call it Sim City. If not for the fact I actually have some decent games on Origin I would try selling my account just to give it away! Luckily for me I still own good old Sim City 4 Rush Hour on Steam so I am signing off and goin to build a new metropolis. P.S: If Sim city 5 adds bigger city squares through a paid DLC we should consider adding a negative scores on Metacritic as this is a piss poor marketing policy...… ",

All practices that have been destroying gaming have culminated in this biblical failure for all the world to see. Ever since the success of Farmville the gaming industry has been trying to cash in on \"social gaming\" foisting it upon gamers that have zero interest in it. This usually manifests itself as a unused feature or minor inconvenience. It was not until EA combined it with the abomination that is DRM to form the perfect storm of consumer neglect; once a single player classic, now a mandatory social game played on servers that are virtually unusable. EA has once again completely shafted all their paying customers to avoid losing a few bucks to pirates. In the same greedy line of thinking they also criminally under-supplied servers, not wanting to pay for more than would be needed after the post launch population dropoff. The result is a game that is virtually unplayable. Not \"this game is so bad that I don\u0027t want to play it\" unplayable, actually unplayable; the game can not be played at all. If by some miracle you do get into a game, you will not be able to get back into the same game again, because all the save data is on the broken servers. If you\u0027ve bought this game and cannot get a refund, contact the Better Business Bureau at http://www.bbb.org/ and file a complaint. It is illegal to offer goods and services that are nonfunctional. This is inexcusable. Literally, they cannot be allowed to make excuses for this. They made the conscious decision to make a game that was one server crash away from bricked, it was their responsibility to make sure that did not happen and obviously it did. I hope they feel most severe repercussions possible to assure that no publisher ever attempts this again.… ",

Last night and this morning, I was pleasantly surprised with stable access and unhindered playability. Although certain details of the game have been removed, overall, the sandbox-like atmosphere of past generations is still there. Aside from an initial shock to just how unstable the Simcity/EA always on DRM can be, I will most likely continue to play this game. I knocked off 2 points for requiring an always on DRM for single player sandboxes, which clearly can and have ruined playability. There is nothing worse than an unintentional rollback of a city hosted on EA servers because of a crash from server side. The fear of a rollback to my work is in my head every second I play this game, but I will admit it wanes as the stability persists from this point forward. Finally, one other point was taken because the map sizes are too small. I would like to see a larger map size and single player always on DRM removed. Since the developers/staff have been working so hard to stabilize servers and bring additional server capacity online, I logically think that future patches will only strengthen this game and fix the concerns I have stated with map size and single player always on DRM.… ",

The game itself is a 9/10 for me on a couple of basis. For one thing, the lack of in depth public transportation option is a tad annoying. I\u0027m a huge fan of monorails and subways in the classics, and miss building them. For another, I bought a physical copy of the game. When using the disc to install a portion of the game, it causes graphical errors where there is no terrain, but you see buildings. It\u0027s an easy fix, just download it. So, after fighting my way through the server base, thinking it would be more fun to hit my phallus with a hammer, I was pretty upset. Then I got into my region. I paused it, set my preliminary road network, wind plant, and zoned, then unpaused it. Fellow gamers, I\u0027ve been waiting for an online SimCity since SimCity 2000 Network Edition where I played one multiplayer game with a school chum, that is nearly 15 years and I have to say, this game is art. Once I fought through all that, the moment I watched the Price family buy their mobile home, and search for a job in my buddy\u0027s neighboring city, it was all worth it. I won\u0027t judge the game for it\u0027s Server issues, that\u0027s the company\u0027s fault not the game. I\u0027m not here to stroke EA\u0027s ego, lord knows that company needs to hide in a cave in the Sahara waiting for future archeologists to rediscover them. But the game itself brings me back to the original SimCity, playing it on a DOS run computer, waiting for my grandmum to bring me tea. I highly recommend this to any true SimCity fan. So, as I eagerly await the work day to end, I leave you with one more thing to say. \"Simcopter 1 reporting heavy traffic\"… ",

In case you have not yet noticed, SimCity has what is called constantly online DRM. This means if the game is running, you MUST be online and logged into Origin, EA\u0027s sales platform, and response to Steam. Now this sounds excellent, in theory. Everyone gets updates automatically, you can play with anyone all over the world, etc. However, the viability of this method ends at THEORY. In reality, this is the smoking gun for this game. I have only had the opportunity to play this game once, for 1 hour and 30 minutes, before I was kicked from the server due to high volume. This is completely unreasonable, and I feel EA was completely unprepared to handle so many users on the server. That is major, obvious oversight on their part, and it ruined the game. Further, totally offline mode is completely eliminated. When I play a game such as SimCity, I expect to be able to play the classic mode where I can quietly play, ALONE. This is no longer an option, as all the cities in a region must co-mingle and supply each other with services, or the city itself is penalized! As an experiment, I attempted to play on a server with other players and remain independent, and rejected the assistance offered to me by other players. After a while, my economy collapsed because all my workers were automatically leaving my city to work at a neighbor\u0027s city. They are programmed to do this for absolutely no reason, other than penalizing players who wish to remain independent from others. In short, the Online Requirement murdered this game, and I regret wasting my hard earned money on it. I encourage all prospective customers to NOT purchase this game, as it will only lead to your disappointment.… ",

What I have played was nice, although plagued by graphical glitches, bugs, and connection problems. The game looks nice and is actually more difficult than I imagined after playing the beta (demo) weekend. I don’t understand why you have to play the tutorial every time you join a new server instead if all menu options being available at all times though. This is the worst decision I have ever seen being made (probably not the worst), and I don’t know how this got through QA. The game is currently plagued by server problems and basically unplayable. The fact there are different servers instead of a one-server technology like The Secret World uses, is bad enough as it is. You can’t really play with everyone and your cities are saved to specific servers and this unavailable anywhere else. Maxis might have made a good game here, but it’s impossible to tell. I wouldn’t recommend anyone to buy this at the moment, as it’s equivalent to buying a not working product or entering a scam deal that asks for 30 quid in exchange for a good fortune. Personally I already feel cheated, having paid for a product that does not work. This is, in my opinion, a scam. I will update my view on it when the game actually works.… ",

You have to create another city to do other things. Nevertheless, the Glassbox simulation engine is doing it\u0027s best to simulate real city life, and it does it PERFECTLY. When you solve one problem(f.e. Sewage), you must be aware that this could cause another problems, needed to be solved quickly. Personally, I like SimCity, the score is low, because of the fail start, and possible problems in future (servers could be off in ~5-6 years). Gameplay does perfectly the thing called \"just one more hour\".… ",

I would have MUCH preffered it on STEAM though, Original is very finicky (6 on 10) Booting up: The game took a while to start, and after several attempts I was finally able to join a server. (1 on 10) Adding friends: At the time of this writing this feature does not properly work, many many errors and adding a friend is very painful to do. You can forget about playing with a friend at this point. we tried for about 2 hours, many reboots and even more errors. We gave up and decided to play \"solo\" until they fix it (1 on 10) Creating your game: My first issue was getting to the game world, there were constant errors and I had to do multiple restarts just to get to the region view of my game world. (1 on 10) Map: Maps are VERY small, you cant modify the terrain in any meaningful way. (4 on 10) Graphics: They work, they arent mind blowing but arent ugly either. (8 on 10) Gameplay: Difficulty: VERY EASY on my first play through of about 2 hours (after skipping the tutorial) I was able to get 7,000$ per hour with no real effort or specialization. A nice little town with schools, fire halls, police stations, everything my citizens needed, taxes 10%. So I sat there thinking \"Well now what??\" (3 on 10) Layout: The UI is very intuitive, everything is well layed out, the layers sub section needs work as there\u0027s many icons and it\u0027s difficult to see which is which. (7 on 10) Building: I really like the new road system, very intuitive and works great, I like the way zoning snaps to the road and builds appropriately however I would also like a more advanced zoning option, one where you can customize exactly what size of zone you want, I like how government buildings are all modable however there is not NEARLY enough base building options for the 59$ price point. I know they plan on adding a whole bunch of DLC in the way of buildings and maps but for this price you get just the very basic buildings. Sad to see because its very obviously a money grab. (5 on 10) Always online: I HATE this feature, I personally don\u0027t have an issue with it but my dad would love to play and he simply can\u0027t because he lives in the boons and has no reliable internet access. Please include an offline mode! (1 on 10) Conclusion: Positives: The game looks decent, the overlays are nice, dynamic roads, sim immersion, traffic simulation, modable buildings. Negatives: Difficulty is very easy, Very few base building options, always online, impossible multiplayer with friends, small maps, gameplay is too simple (no power lines or pipes at all), no complex tax system, all graphs are gone. If I was to rename this game I would call it: SimCity Children Addition My Rating: 3.6… ",

I\u0027ve just wasted 6 hours of my life trying to get this game to work properly and there is no hope. For those who are skeptical, just google \"SimCity Servers\" or \"Simcity Problems\". The critic reviews must have been based on a version that did not require online connectivity through Origin and it\u0027s servers. Strike 1- If you\u0027ve ever played any SimCity, you know that it is a single player game and there is really no need for internet access. Strike 2- If EA was going to force the online DRM on us, they should have at least made sure that you can actually get online... You can\u0027t, I can\u0027t, and no one has been able to since the game launched days ago. Strike 3- It would be nice if you could save the game so you could save what little progress you might make before the game fails. Of course, you cannot even save the game when you want to. Strike, er 4?- Adding insult to injury, one must complete the tutorial before getting to actual gameplay. Since you cannot get through the tutorial without the game crashing and cannot save your progress, you are perpetually stuck replaying the first 5 minutes of the tutorial... Awful. To heck with it, Strike 5- EA should at least be communicating honestly with purchasers/customers about the errors rather than posting blatant lies about how only a small percentage is unable to play and ridiculous excuses on why its not working or how its being fixed and when. Supreme fail by EA.… ",

Still giving this game worst rating even disregarding server issues and losing cites i spent hours on because the server doesn\u0027t feel like saving my game at any point. Anyway, so the actual game play was really fun.. for the first 6 to 8 hours then EVERYTHING STOPS WORKING. Every part of the city seems to be break eventually. Everyone stops going to school, buses stop picking people up, trucks stop delivering. My education adviser says build more schools when my fully functional school classrooms sit empty. Basically all of the features seem to stop working after 6 to 10 hours of play. Gifts to neighboring cities simply disappear. Maps with big mountains are impossible to get roads up to where you are supposed to build the city. My mayor\u0027s mansion has no place to plant the flag so i cannot move on to other upgrades. The game seems completely unfinished definitely not ready for release. My fire trucks can not get out of the station because of traffic. Seriously no one lets the FIRE TRUCK in. It\u0027s blaring lights are on, but they just drive past it never letting it into the street. Same for police and ambulances. I see cars driving down a street in circles. I could go on, but I\u0027m sure you get the point. Those hours of fun just feel like a trick once everything stops working. I spent 10 hours building this city up only to realize it\u0027s a sham of an unfinished beta of a game. Why do I have to send maxis man out on patrol every minute for him to do his job? Why do I have to pay the super hero 1000 dollars to drive around all day to catch a single criminal? There are numerous missing UI components. I.E. where is the back button when joining a game so I don\u0027t have to go back to main menu every time I join a full game. Where is the filter to filter out full games? How about filtering so I only see regions actively being played so I don\u0027t join a dead one. I hope EA doesn\u0027t find out my email and ban my origin account for giving a bad review. They do that if you complain on their forums. also read they hired Chinese spammers to comment positively about the game. Why just comments, why not buy review spams on metacritic? Oh, probably because of that successful lawsuit against that movie company(Sony was it? i forget) that paid off reviewers of Rob Snider films. Their legal department probably said fake reviews no, comments yes. I am tempted to dispute the charge with my bank to get a refund since EA smugly refuses, but that\u0027d get my account banned for sure and I\u0027d lose my other games. Simply vile, evil evil company practices at work here. Now i understand the hate. Yes, it makes me strong.. gives me focus.… ",

Next the game itself, they removed some of the best features from previous simcity games, you can\u0027t create your own regions or cities and terraform the land, making hills and rivers ect. The size of the cities is ridiculously small, the whole city can be filled up in an hour, so you have to choose what to demolish to continue building. Also there are very limited public transportation options, I\u0027m sure they will have DLC with more in the future, but for the price of the game, more options should have been included. One of my favorite features of SC4 was that it allowed modding, the community created some amazing mods for the game, that\u0027s why it has been around and popular for over 10 years. I\u0027m also worried about money hungry EA and their \"micro-transactions\", what happened to expansion packs, rush hour was awesome and totally worth it. I guess for now I\u0027ll just have to stick with SC4 until Civitas (moddable, DRM free, city simulator on kickstarter) is funded and released.… ",

This time tough we had Sim City running on Glassbox. Seeing the engine getting named seperatly I really had high hopes. In my inmagination I would think this engine would create a whole new dimension of details not ever seen before in Sim City. Could we now follow each civillian individually? Could we see them get in their car, go shop or go to work and get home again? Could we see what their doing at home? I mean in the end of the day this is a humans behaviour simulator right? Unfortunatly none of this is actually the case. To make things worse this actually feels like a limited Sim City... Allot of things have been removed, but not much has been given in return.. Yes its true you can actually click a civilian and see its name and follow it down the street, but once it goes in a building its gone. Talking about going in buildings. Sometimes you see 10 to 12 cars to go inside a single house. They simply just dissapear. And this is not the only strange thing. Many behaviours by your sims is just strange.. One building is complaining by no shoppers, while the second building is telling you business is going fantastic. Theres all kind off odd things like these which makes you feel the game was maybe not finished? So what has been removed? Landscaping, Power lines, Waterlines, Big maps, What did we get in return? Well some online social stuff, which currently doesn\u0027t seem to work very well. After numberous login attemps I have not yet been able to succesfully use any of the social functions. For example selling power between city\u0027s has not worked for me once yet.. Overall I got the feeling of a very limited game which is in no way an advancement of the previous sim city\u0027s. Basically all you can do is build roads and then decide to either allow industry, housing or commercial to be build next to the road. Then on top you build some basic things like watertower, police and fireman but thats about it.. EA I\u0027m very dissapointed. I just paid 60 bucks for this and its simply just not worth it.

Yes, this game is radically different than the other SimCity games. I\u0027ve read a lot of reviews that seems to be blasting the game for not being exactly like 4. I think this is an unrealistic expectation. The first change, and something I really can\u0027t defend, is the always online requirement. It makes no sense. I am happy to report that as of 3/8/13, I\u0027ve been able to connect with minimal problems. It\u0027s still unacceptable, as EA could turn those servers off at any time. I seriously doubt they\u0027ll be maintained for more 4-5 years. I was conflicted as to if I should deduct points from my score for the DRM. It\u0027s not really the game itself, but it impacts the game. After considering it, I ultimately decided the game loses 1 point for the DRM. As for the game play itself, it\u0027s enjoyable. While zoning looks different, it\u0027s still similar. For instance, I\u0027ve found if you make roads in a square configuration and lay residential zones around the entire interior, it functions very similarly to the old zoning system. Of course, you can\u0027t make the squares too large or this breaks down. The guide lines are your friend for properly placing the roads. Another issue mentioned is the size of the lot. Yes, I admit it\u0027s small but I find that it\u0027s actually not as constricting as one would imagine. I played for about 4 hours on Llama speed for most, but not all, of the time. (I\u0027ve never enjoyed any of the SimCities on high speed) I had less than half the map filled up, so it doesn\u0027t go by quite as fast as some other reviews on here claim. I suppose if you ran it on Cheetah speed the entire time, the time to build might be reduced. I eventually started up a second city as I realized I had screwed the first one up beyond fixing unless I wanted to shell out several hundred thousand simoleons to fix it. I did not want to do this. And that brings me to the next part: The \"region grid\" with the multiple city sites. I like this idea, actually. Very rarely in real life do you get a city that functions entirely on its own. They always need to bring things in from outside, and I found this system to work very well. My first city had a large excess of power, so I bought some for my second city. The first city sometimes sends over cops or ambulances to help out. Sometimes an arsonist escapes from the first city and tries to burn down the second. I\u0027m actually enjoying this very much, and like the idea of making a series of interconnected cities. People complain about the lack of infrastructure, and I can understand that. I enjoyed optimally placing power wires. I\u0027d make them incredibly redundant. 4 or 5 power plants with a giant tangle of lines so no one can ever lose power without destroying the power plants. Sure, that was fun, but not really a necessary component of the game. I don\u0027t see the loss of infrastructure control as a big thing overall. Do I like what the old SimCity games had to offer? Definitely. Do I like what the new SimCity offers? Absolutely. It\u0027s a different perspective at a game. It leans just a little towards the casual and, quite honestly, that makes the game better. I can see why hardcore SimCity gamers would hate this, and that\u0027s fine. Not everyone will. I may have played SimCity since the start, but I don\u0027t consider myself a hardcore fan. Once every few years, I\u0027ll pull one of the games out and play them for a few weeks, then put it away and pull it out again a few years later. People also complain about Day One DLC. I don\u0027t see a problem with it. I like the concept of DLC so long as it doesn\u0027t take away from gameplay. What\u0027s the day one DLC? The ability to make European-looking cities. (Place a Double Decker Bus Station, for instance, and everything starts looking British.) That\u0027s completely visual. It\u0027s fine. If the ability to place Industrial Zones was DLC... well, then I\u0027d have a problem. But it isn\u0027t, so I don\u0027t. The way I see it, it comes down to this: If you like SimCity the way it was, and I can absolutely see why someone would, go play that. SimCity 4 holds up wonderfully even by 2013 standards. You want something different? Just as engaging and addictive? Then give SimCity 5 a try. The best endorsement I can give the game is this: I started playing at 10pm a few nights ago. After I played for a while and looked at the clock, it was 5am. Yeah, it\u0027s _that_ sort of a game. So, final score? Without the DRM, it\u0027d get a solid 9/10. I\u0027d like to see a few changes (variable sized cities would be nice, maybe the ability to place farmland again) but the game is great as is. However, as I stated earlier, the game loses 1 point for its obnoxious DRM. Final verdict is 8/10.… ",

Once I heard about the always online requirement, I knew this game would be a wreck. Server issues aside, there are serious design flaws and limitations around single player play. Even when you give in to the \"social\" aspect that was created to justify the always online DRM, you find loads of bugs that prevent you from working with others, allow others to wreck your cities, or even cause you to lose your city entirely. The level of frustration and disappointment is unbelievable. At the core, SimCity does some things better than ever, but it rarely works long enough for you to tell. In the end, it lacks the size, scale and features of previous versions, and spends most of it\u0027s time frustrating you.… ",

I have contacted EA customer support (Via Origin) three times to request a refund or any kind of help with the issues I have been experiencing. Each time I was refused both. Origin refuses to refund a broken product that they sold in good faith, which is a clear violation of U.S Federal law, as well as nearly every other western country. This is the first time I\u0027ve ever purchased a game through Origin and it will be my last. Since I was refused a refund, I feel like I have been scammed. I will now do something I\u0027ve never done in my life, which is to boycott the products of a company. I will never buy a EA involved game for the rest of my days, and I would encourage all game lovers to do that same. I would also advise investors of EA to jump ship and sell.

Picture sitting in a sandbox...literally, the sandbox that you sat in as a kid is probably about the size of their cities. You want a huge metropolis? Too bad but for an extra £20 you can get the European Cities Set! I have no idea why you have to pay an extra £20 for a few game maps and a dozen or so new buildings but apparently EA have a damn good reason. There are a few interface innovations that take away a lot of the micro-management that plagued the two former games in the series but you will quickly run out of things to do and I personally was bored after a day of the single player. Multiplayer is really where they placed all their eggs and that is good fun if you\u0027re playing with the right people, but it\u0027s not that much different from one of the social media sim cities that are free. The reliability of the servers is bad for one person, with 3 or more it\u0027s impossible to get a really good game going so you are forced to stay small scale. Because of the online DRM you can\u0027t set up an LAN connection so I don\u0027t see this issue being solved anytime soon. All-in-all it\u0027s a steaming pile of that costs £45 (£65 for European Cities) and it\u0027s worth about £0.01. I looked at their website which claims they have won 26 PC game awards...I\u0027m absolutely at a loss for where they got that figure, though many were given pre-release. It\u0027s just an example of how corrupt and deceptive is this thing called Gaming Journalism. Stay away from this game and away from anyone claiming to be a professional game critic.… ",

Now you can\u0027t even control the terrain, so there literally IS going to be a PERFECT city that somebody in Korea designs. I\u0027m not cool with that, it takes all the imagination out of it. They also left out the ability to drive around doing missions, move in your own Sims, and (I am saying it again) control the size of your city. I am giving the game a 7 because I am trying to take a step back from my years of experience with the previous games and what they have given me, and just looking at SimCity from an objective angle.

Perhaps as I work in application development I have a bit more patience, and I have no wrath towards the EA team. I know they are going to iron out the technical issues and once they do, what\u0027s there is actually pretty cool. I have not encountered any issues as yet. So I can only speak to the game experience. What we have here is a great simulation engine, it\u0027s like having a digital ant-farm that you cultivate and create again. It is an MMO of sorts and for a myriad of reasons, EA and Maxis have forced a multiplayer experience. I can see why many customers are asking for an offline, large scale sandbox equivalent that is after all what SimCity has always been. I would like this too, but that is not what I bought the game for. The game feels a bit more alive knowing that there are other cities growing beside you. The interaction is limited and just enough that you can play in your sandbox without someone coming over and destroying your creation. As a game, it\u0027s fairly easy to set up a functional town. Specializing and leveling up is more of a fun chore. Its enjoyable to watch the impressive details. The first time I saw criminals and police have a gun fight with funky music thrown in I knew the devs had more details in store. Also, the game has an addictive and casual nature to it. I\u0027ve been so immersed in first-person shooters (Red Orchestra 2, Counter Strike Global Offensive, BF3) that I thought this would be a nice break more relaxing and less demanding. It\u0027s perfect in that regard. Expect to EA monetize it to bits. Which will be okay providing they provide quality content. Buy this game if the premise, detail, lively town-sized maps, persistent online regions, always on connection has appeal or if you can live with some of the DRM downsides. Do not buy this game if you want massive SimCity sprawls, reliable offline play, terraforming, and user mods. Oh and performance is solid too, most computer should run this well providing they have dedicated graphics card. For those that have shelled out your dough, had a rotten first week, give this a chance. If they get it running consustently (which by latest accounts is where it looks like thus isheading), compensate for the week of lost gaming, and continue to update and tweak then its worth reconsideration.… ",

What people fail to realize is the Maxis was not requiring all-the-time connectivity to be greedy, but rather to allow full fruition of the visions they had for the game\u0027s experience. They imbedded this new idea into the game to allow for brilliant simulations of cities, simulations of which many older computers of which the game is supporting would cause the game to be horribly slow if not for offsite calculations. Yes this idea didn\u0027t work out in the start, and yes the other motives behind the ideal were less than benevolent, however once again I must point out that Maxis has apologize and is trying there best to make amends. Honestly in my view the true problem isn\u0027t the company(at this point they are near to resolving the issue and getting back to near 100% uptime), but rather the players. It honestly sickens me to see how critical and cynical gamers have become about the industry. Game companies as of late have been trying to bring about a revolution to a industry that is in need of one. \"We paid for the games, we have every right to play it right away!\" Oh boo hoo, you can\u0027t play the game, so lets instead go and be little children throwing tamper tantrums and downrating the game on every review site we can find. Let me ask you, if any of you read this far, when Amazon ships you a defective product do you refuse to use Amazon anymore and downrate it, or Apple\u0027s new iPhone comes out and the site is down due to traffic do you go about to every site and downrate the phone, or when any MMO takes a server down for maintenance downrate it, or... well it\u0027s easy enough to make a list that\u0027ll make anyone scoring the game with a zero due to server issues seem like children. In the end Maxis has been putting countless hour and dollars into fixing their problems and have been apologizing many times over, they have done their part, now due yours. Stop being impatient, wait a day, then play the actual game and rate the game, not the servers. If not just remember the more you act like children and constantly go around berating every game company that makes a game with a few issues, the less these companies want to take risks. The less risks the less of the games we\u0027ve come to love. Eventually the wondrous and full featured games like this and others will be gone. Only to be replaced by freemium model casual games, of which are extremely cheep to develop and make profits similar if not greater to full-fledge games such as this. Because of this I feel the need to reiterate a point, stop being children, wait until the game can be played to rate the game.… ",

If I am going to play solo than let me play and not make me connect. I want my money back and will never be buying any game that is on line only and will never buy another Sim City game again. I have heard rumors that to make up for the terrible experience that a free game will be given but I don\u0027t want some pre-picked game that is probably going to suck as well. Just give us a refund or at least a free game or games up to $40-$60 of our choice. Don\u0027t waste your money and if you really want it wait until they fix all the problems.

It would have been nice to have the option to play with a single big city in the sandbox mode in offline, however that could come later, it\u0027s better they focus on doing one thing really well, than spreading out too early. I think the general hate to this style of play and the city size comes from people who just see it and haven\u0027t actually played it. I think the direction has made each city more personal and look less generic than the cities of old which were really copied and pasted and you felt so far removed from the people in the city. There are a few issues I have with building placement, I wish there was an indication on the floor before it snaps, I wish you could rotate and I wish you didn\u0027t need a road for every building, the airport is really annoying to place. It also makes it annoying because you want to place parks and things away from the roads, however you cannot, so you end up having to make so many pointless roads. I also wish\u0027d you could undo changes like you can in photoshop. So many times have I upgraded and hit the wrong one and not been able to change it. There are a few problems with the gameplay here and there, however what game doesn\u0027t have small issues? I just hope they listen to people and patch the issues rather than putting them in as DLC or something weird like EA is prone to do. One DLC feature I would like however is to be able to build buildings like you can in the Sims, however then save them and use them like prefabs, it would make our cities look even more unique. I don\u0027t get why people are moaning so much about the 3/4 days of unstable servers. This game is always online, they haven\u0027t kept it secret and we all knew it would be like this for a few days until they judge the amount of servers they need. People are acting like such pathetic kids and the worst thing about it is I bet all the people complaining knew it would happen and yet still bought it day one and still are complaining. I bet most people in fact never even bought the game but are moaning. Like get over it people, this happens with every online game of it\u0027s nature and even COD got it wrong once and had poor servers at launch. Just wait until they get it under control and then buy it......... Amazing game, I\u0027ve been playing it pretty much non stop since the UK launch on Friday (Sunday now) and I\u0027m having such a blast. I\u0027m loving the online play as well, it\u0027s so much fun with friends. I just hope they add filters in if you want to play a public game as it\u0027s hard to find empty slots in them. I wouldn\u0027t listen to the whiners though, they\u0027re just being pathetic, just give it a week and then go and purchase it.… ",

On theOne of the first games I played on PC was the original Simcity. That has been my favorite game of all time and it grew into the whole series of Sim games including SimFarm, SimEarth, and SimAnt to name a few. When I first heard about another Simcity coming out, I was so overjoyed that I actually downloaded Origin and preordered the Limited Edition against my better judgement. On the day this game came out, my heart got stuffed into a wood chipper. This game has failed on many levels of trying to live up to it\u0027s past history. Most of the fan base that has followed SimCity through the ages grew up on the single player mode of making your own mega-city. This game with it\u0027s \"regions\" should be renamed to SimTown. The areas in which you build your \"town\" are as small as the original SimCity. Nothing like SimCity 4 (which I have reinstalled to play in order to get over my heartache). The game tries it\u0027s darn best to force to play with other people in order to share resources between \"towns\". This right now is bugged 6 ways to Sunday with people constantly dropping off or causing an action that can easily destroy your \"town\". The 0-day content already being offered makes it seem like EA is already going to nickle and dime gamers in order to add more content (The Sims 2 and 3). Then we get into the nuts and bolts of the game. The DRM is a real killer for this game. You have no hard drive saves of your game at all. All the saves are cloud saves and if the server has a hiccup, your hard earned \"towns\" are gone for all of time. This \"towns\" can only be stored on the server you use them on and can\u0027t be transferred at all. If EA decides to get rid of the servers, this game then becomes UNPLAYABLE for the rest of time. The line trotted out by the development team that most of the calculations are done on the server and that\u0027s why gamers need to be always connected to their servers is just making the gamers mad because they believe that all EA wants is DRM on all the future games and don\u0027t want to say it out loud. This is just bad PR on their part. The only thing that prevented the score from being zero was the music was just right for a SimCity game and that was the only saving grace(not much of one). Congratulations EA, you have just destroyed a historic and treasured game series with a game that has cemented the view of many gamers that you are now the Evil Empire.… ",

Do this, then do that.

The removal of subways and certain types of rails also limit this game. Another aspect that hurts this game is the need to be constantly connected. Once the map is filled, what do you do? Go start another city and do the same thing over again? That is really the only choice. Aside from the server problems, when this game is no longer supported by its makers, will our copies of SimCity be unplayable and useless? My guess is, \"Yes\". Overall: This game is not worth the price. I\u0027m not sure it ever will be after hearing about micro transactions and a possible in-game store. That will only drive the price up the more it is played. Save yourself the cash and do not purchase this game.… ",

The reason being, is that the problems are fundamental DESIGN decisions that broke this game and unless EA decides to go against those DESIGN decisions that massive amount of players have been rightfully criticizing for MONTHS are finally listened to and heeded, this game will be referenced as THE screwup to reference for YEARS. The online DRM is beyond idiotic. Morons keep stating, well ALL GAMES are like this at launch like this. WRONG. Even IF it HAPPENS fairly regularly, it shows complete INCOMPETENCE to allow it to happen AT ALL. They KNOW how many preorders occur, they can tell in REAL TIME how many people are buying it and extrapolate how many servers they should need. But it goes beyond this farcical rationale of allowing the shaft up ones butt to say \u0027this is normal\u0027. It\u0027s not normal, SimCity is a game that DOESN\u0027T NEED online anything. Now, if they WANT to OFFER multiplayer, FINE. In fact it would be a PLUS to OFFER it. But NOT at the expense of forcing your customer, in a depression mind you, to put up with crap that they don\u0027t need to after paying. Single player should always be able to work OFFLINE. Period, end of story. There is NO legitimate rationale that beats this, and they made the game MORE EXPENSIVE to render it useless as such. Additionally it makes the game MORE expensive to maintain, even MORE so then they obviously were expecting, which DOES mean that THIS game will have a short shelf life, as EA will pull the servers relatively quickly if they need 2-4-8x the amount of servers \u0027necessary\u0027 to play the game, even though the whole process was UNNECESSARY to begin with. A single player game should not be rendered unplayable on day 1 or year 2 or 3 because the servers are offline. Though even if they had a five year plan, does it now become 2 or 3 because they need to run all these extra servers? Given EA\u0027s track record, that\u0027s almost assuredly YES. Now what\u0027s the 2nd most debilitating aspect of this game? THE SAVES. We\u0027ve had hard drives available to us since the 1980\u0027s. There simply is NO REASON to make it a cloud only save system. It\u0027s a big middle finger to ALL of us. Already I\u0027ve had THREE CITIES, including one this morning Sunday, March 10th that cannot be loaded. Oh it\u0027s registering that it was lucky enough to be saved as it\u0027s showing up in resume, this time, but it simply won\u0027t load. Again, this is ANOTHER unnecessary DESIGN decision. One they need to give up on, and one if they WANTED TO, could be done in a single day. Not hard to develop a save system. Simple as pie. Why don\u0027t they? BECAUSE THEY DON\u0027T WANT YOU TO BE ABLE TO. Even IF it worked, it takes AWAY your ability to take cities different directions. To try some stuff out and decide whether or not you made a mistake without having to start a brand new city. Disasters? Well hey one of the major fun times of Sim City is the ability to save something, and destroy the hell out of it with disasters, and then reload it and it\u0027s good as new. Nevermore. Because of a DESIGN decision. So this game doesn\u0027t JUST have issues that are \u0027normal\u0027 for online only games, it\u0027s a single player game that has problems at launch which are completely unforgivable AND the problems overall with these design decisions won\u0027t go away with simply more servers. They neuter the game throughout the gameplay, add unnecessary reliability issues, and will shorten the games life, guaranteed. Then I can go with the FACT that these cities are absolutely TINY. You used to be able to have 30 huge megalopolises to now 15 or so tiny neighborhoods? Quite a few features have been removed too, but I can understand some change on that front, but the size of cities is simply unforgivable. The city size is also most likely due to NETWORK ability to handle them, with perhaps some issues with power of ones PC. Don\u0027t listen to the morons who are scoring this well. They simply don\u0027t have the tools to understand the whole breadth of the situation. If they can get full on crackers and call it a meal, good for them, but it is by definition, not an all-you-can-eat. This game has MAJOR problems, and more servers will not solve them. Only a proper patch that EA must have a mea culpa on to change some of these design decisions will salvage this game. One that I do not believe EA has the balls or customer appreciation to engage in. Allow people to save their games on THEIR system and control that. Allow them to play offline so that if servers go down, either through errors or eventual discontinuance, people can still play their games. After this address the city sizes, as most likely it IS the network aspect that helped limit their sizes. So once you remove that, and realize there are plenty of people that can play larger maps, there simply is NO REASON to limit their city size in the way they have.… ",

Major Problem #2: It\u0027s just too easy, there isn\u0027t a whole lot to it and it can be mastered quickly Major Problem #3 There are no ordinances, policies etc to run the city--it has simply been turned into a city building game with sometimes silly animated visuals Major Problem #4: Big changes have minimal impact-- for the city to really go downhill you really, really have to do it almost on purpose, you can get away with a lot, this isn\u0027t realistic. Overall I am VERY disappointed with SimCity (5). Not because it wasn\u0027t made well (it was, it\u0027s def. quality) but because they put in all of this thought and missed the main reasons why people love the SimCity franchise--you can run all facets of a city including policies, more detailed finances (what about budgeting by department??) and other strategically driven options and inputs. I still recommend the game but only for those interested in a pretty straight forward city building game- the management people should leave it.… ",

The multiplayer is stupid sure if you\u0027re connected to another city via a highway its fun you can send police, fire, trucks, amberlamps and sell or buy services from another city that is connected with a highway. The problem is only about 4 of the 16 cities are connected via highway in a region so whats the point. Sure those cities are connected but what about all the others they don\u0027t benefit from anything you do in the other cities. It even says your departments connected to your City hall are supposedly region wide but they aren\u0027t so if you start a city that\u0027s not connected with a highway you are basically starting from scratch on a tiny patch of land that\u0027s often full of hills and valleys and water that you can even build on and there is no terraforming only what your road does to the land when you lay it down except it just terraforms around the road still leaving the land around it completely incapable of supporting structures.Notice how i said nothing of the DRM or Server issues that also plague this game.

Their aggressive DRM goes far beyond mere inconvenience caused by an attempt to strike a balance between playability and ensuring the game is properly licensed by players. This approach is positively antagonistic, with no gameplay allowed without EA in the middle, players needs be damned. Additionally, continued gameplay is beholden to their servers, their desire to continue supporting the game, and the capabilities of their servers to handle the workload. I have always pulled out Simcity games for years after my first play though. But what happens when EA decides the ROI to maintain the game servers isn\u0027t there anymore?

I have also noted it appears you can only send resources to your closest neighbours not those further distance.

Remember games that had you install things like GameSpy and games that still install punkbuster. I hate that garbage. I don\u0027t want that junk on my computer. It just sucks up resources and is useless. This Origins thing is nothing more than a slightly more sophisticated piece of bloatware. EA has got to be one of the WORST game companies out there.

Can\u0027t wait until next gen consoles come out with anti-resale measures and find the sales of new games just plummet. Maybe someday EA will stop being evil and I will be able to buy these games as stand-alones, without the bloatware. Until then I just wont play them. Everyone I know hates Origins and only a few have broken down and bought a game that requires it. The rest just throw their hands up in the air and play something else.

No, I am going to ignore that because most reviews fall into two camps: The game sucks because of the DRM, or the game is good once you get past the DRM. But even when you ignore the DRM, SimCity is a below average city builder with many glaring problems. First, the roads. The roads are incredibly difficult to place exactly as you want them. They tend to be glitchy, not letting you turn a 3-way intersection into a 4-way or not letting you make a turn if part of the road is bent slightly. Even on flat land, roads can be problematic, but presented with any kind of a hill and roads become hard to place and nearly useless. Nothing can be built on hills, so any road that runs along a hill becomes useless. In real life, hills with water views become covered with expensive houses, but in SimCity, they are just big piles of dirt, sometimes with a road on it. The pathfinding on roads is also incredibly suspect. While en route to a fire, firemen will often go in circles ten to fifteen times before finding the path or finding an even cooler place to do donuts. This is something you will likely experience very soon after starting your first city, because the first thing new fire departments like to do is shoot off a bunch of fireworks, which start fires all over your city. Just get one of the many city builders that actually work. I quite like Tropico 4 (which has its own form of annoying DRM, but not nearly as bad as SimCity).… ",

There are lots of fine, gamer-friendly, indie games out therefor you to spend your time and money on. Don\u0027t forget, EA turned off server support for Madden and FIfa 2011 already. Those games are only 2.5 years old and have lost their online support. EA is quite willing to shutdown servers for their games to force you to buy newer versions. What happens when SimCity\u0027s servers are shutdown in a few years? You won\u0027t be able to play a game that you bought. Actually, strike that. You didn\u0027t purchase a game. You purchased a service from EA. A terrible one at that. Can you imagine any other service that\u0027s so intrusive and shoddy? I wouldn\u0027t pay for it.… ",

Fortunately, nobody will want to play it anyways. This game made me want to dust off SinCity 4, and take it for a spin.… ",

EAMaxis\u0027 demographic has been slowly changing since the first Sims, from adult gamers who enjoy in depth simulation games to kids who want to play with a digital dollhouse. Which is fine, kids need games too, but with no adult alternatives and horrible business practices taking advantage of their young userbase (Sims 3 content costs £300+) it dismays me. The positives: the engine is quite nice and stable and it looks pretty enough and I do actually like the region trading system even if I resent being forced into it, but that\u0027s not enough to redeem this insult to the series.

While they are still lingering, and servers are constantly coming down and back up daily, the game is now at least playable for an extended amount of time. In my originalI originally reviewed this game on day two after the North American release. I rated it 7 out of 10. I am changing my review to a 2 out of 10. When I first reviewed the game, there were serious server issues. While they are still lingering, and servers are constantly coming down and back up daily, the game is now at least playable for an extended amount of time. In my original review, I praised the graphics, interface, deep simulation, and the way they mesh together. I stand by my assessment of the graphics and interface. However, upon playing the game uninterrupted for several hours, as well as doing number crunching, and reading other accounts of people doing the same kinds of observations I have been, I\u0027ve come to the conclusion that the simulation is not nearly as deep as it appears. One of the great features touted by the developers in this game was the \u0027GlassBox\u0027 engine, which supposedly has literally thousands of \u0027sims\u0027 (citizens of your city) being simulated on the EA servers, which allows a realistic and complex city to emerge on your screen without users needing to own a supercomputer. This conveniently provided their rationale for requiring a constant connection to their servers at all times even while playing single player. This is manifestly false. You can physically disconnect your internet from your computer while playing and the supposedly server-side simulation continues to hum along without a hitch. My complaint here is not about the requirement of the internet connection (though there are many reasons to dislike it), but by the completely invented reasoning behind its inclusion. In addition to this complaint, there are an entire host of client-side issues which are either bugs, or simply non-features to begin with. The supposedly intelligent traffic system in which \"everyone has a home and a workplace unless unemployed\", is also false. The \"simulation\" does not simulate actions of the sims, it simply spawns cars and moves them around in a fashion which would *appear* to show a collection of individual behaviors. Essentially, it \"simulates\" the simulation. The same can be said for the industrial system, in which supposedly residents work and produce goods, which are then shipped off to businesses to be sold to citizens that made money working \u0026 producing other goods. This is also false. Despite showing lots of big numbers when you look at your population statistics regarding \"shipped freight\", \"goods sold\" etc, these are essentially arbitrary numbers based on the population of your city (which also over time becomes greatly inflated compared to the number of actual \"sims\" visible moving about your city) and the makeup of your zones which you have placed. The businesses do not recieve shipments from industry, they restock automatically at the beginning of each game day, regardless of the availability of goods either in your city or your region. It is entirely possible and workable to have a city with zero industry and only residents and shops, with no imports, exports, or production, but the city will \"thrive\" on. In short, the much touted \"depth\" of simulation is a complete sham. The real achievement by Maxis is the ability of the game to pull the wool over your eyes and show you what purports to be a much more realistic and complex simulation than previous SimCity titles when in fact, the game is far simpler, less realistic, more limited, and worst of all, dysfunctional to the core.… ",

Decisions like this are terrible for the consumers and terrible for the industry I make games for a living, too, and my heart goes out to all the brilliant creative individuals who will have worked very hard on this game, only to have some money-filching, good-for-nothing corporate suits pull a stunt that would take all that effort and turn it into a product that\u0027s currently pulling a much-deserved 1.7 consumer rating on metacritic. And to top it all off, those same suits will now be pointing fingers and eyeing up the developers for deep budget cuts... which I sadly expect to be reading about on a respected gaming review site in a few months. Shame on EA! And, apparently, EA honestly believes that some of us will buy their latest false claims that SimCity NEEDS the always-online DRM because the game “offloads a significant amount of the calculations to our servers”, and that it would take “a significant amount of engineering work from our team to rewrite the game” for single player.

That is, in order to play the game by yourself you must have a constant secure connection to EA\u0027s server. This puts you at the mercy of EA\u0027s hardware \u0026 IT team, something that is beyond your control.--------------------------------------------------- Released on March 5th, it is now late afternoon March 12th and there are still major server issues. I am currently on West Coast 4 and am getting long que times trying to join, and it isn\u0027t even peak hours on the west coast. I can only assume the load will increase as most people get off work and arrive home in the next hour or two.-------------------------------------------------------- SimCity has traditionally been a single player game many people like to play around in for hundreds of real time hours. Since SimCity is \"always multiplayer\", in order to play by ones self you must create a region and set it to \"Private\" mode where only you or invited friends can join. The whole idea of that is counter-intuitive in the fullest. Instead of a traditional \"Single Player\" and \"Multiplayer\" button on the main menu that has worked for decades, Maxis forces you to click \"Play\" and enter the multiplayer screen. Someone not that initiated into how games work will find it frustrating to start a singleplayer game even though the \"single player\" is technically classified as private multiplayer.---------------------------------------- Maxis \u0026 EA are in full damage control public relations mode, all cheery smiles and apologies. Sadly, a large portion of the previously angry customer-base was easily bought with the offer of a free game. Instead of bombarding EA \u0026 Maxis with thousands of angry letters \u0026 emails demanding the removal of Online DRM and \"Always multiplayer\" nature of SimCity, they instead were bought off for around $60 and are now towing the line. They seem to think that companies releasing unfinished or highly flawed/untested products is A-ok, as long as they \"pinky swear\" to fix the game which the timeframe is never admitted. It could be 1 month or even two months before a game is fixed, but there will still be that large group of customers with unyielding blind faith, always ready to defend the happy, cheery gaming company that just recieved 60+ dollars from them for a buggy, non-working product.----------------------------- If you are wondering why game developers and publishers are getting away with extremely sloppy business practices, you need only look at the modern gamer. The customers are the problem because they do not vote with their wallets and protest in writing.--------------------------When you buy a new car, it usually comes with some kind of warranty. If your transmission for example blows seconds after your off the lot, they will replace it for free immediately. Conversely, you expect the car to be 100% working properly and built correctly when you buy it, and every car manufacturer does everything possible to make sure that happens long before you fork over the cash. The same MUST be true for all products or services. Mistakes do happen, but things of the magnitude of SimCity do not just happen accidentally. Someone somewhere made the decision that lower costs were more worth it than a working game. There will likely be bugs on all release of games, but we have the right to demand that their game work properly. In SimCity\u0027s case, it does not even work at all.-------------- Don\u0027t believe the public relations spin and the attempt to buy your sympathy and loyalty back. If you have any principles at all, for god sakes please make your integrity one of them. Show EA/Maxis that no, you cannot be simply be bought for $60. Demand they remove Online DRM, demand a deserved true Single Player, among various other small things.------ I rated this a 3 out of 10, only because in the extremely short time I have played the actual game, it is well done. Probably the biggest sadness of all is that underneath these unacceptable business practices, a good development team has produced a pretty awesome game.… ",

    "comments": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view. The Good: Simcity has very good graphics. The data overlays are beautiful. Construction looks realistic. Nonrenewable resources add a new and interesting flavor to the game. Multiplayer regions with multiple cities online add a new and very fun flavor. There are new disasters which look and play realistically, have unexpected effects on your city. You can now build curving roads and road/road overpasses. Roads now govern your buildings density. There is a good selection of different buildings. The Bad: -Serverside Always-Online DRM means that you have to have a stable internet connection; the slightest hiccup in your internet will result in the game crashing and you losing hours of game play. The servers are horrible; most of them are either \"busy\" or \"full\", meaning that you can\u0027t play at all. They also crash often. Server capacity is abysmal. There is no \"offline\" option for single player games. All saves must be synced with EA\u0027s cloud servers; you cannot have any local saves on your hard drive. -Clientside Buildings often look half finished and devoid of color or decoration; it is clear that this was an unfinished product that was rushed out. City sizes are limited to approx. 2km x 2km; slightly smaller then the smallest map size on Simcity 4. Buildings cannot be placed anywhere where they are not adjacent to a road; you can no longer fill in the interior of city blocks with parks/etc. Some graphics appear half finished, i.e. grass showing through a road, dirt overlapping on a road, or jagged/flickering graphics. The game is slow to respond to neighbor deals, such as sending power or sewage to a neighbor. Parks look like they\u0027re made with astroturf. Waves/beaches look unrealistic. Zones are aligned on a road and cannot be expanded to show the entire zone; this makes planning for city blocks very difficult. There is no subway, elevated rail, monorail, or highways available to be built. Agriculture/farms have been completely removed from the game. It was not designed to be compatible with player-designed mods. Overall: This game had the potential to be something great, to be a truly awesome game. But with the forced DRM limitations EA has imposed on us, as well as the horrifying state of their servers, this game has become yet another destined for the bookshelf. Maxis outdid itself with bringing new ideas, concepts, and operations into the game, but with the client-side limitations such as city sizes and lack of transportation options, not to mention the server-side DRM, the game is effectively crippled. Bluntly, I can not recommend this game to anyone. One can only hope that EA will listed to the community and fix what is wrong.

While this doesn\u0027t prevent gameplay you are forced to keep the game running because if you quit the game before it reconnects the you will lose your progress since the last save. Having said that it did take two days before the \u0027buy\u0027 button on the website worked without giving a \u0027server error\u0027 Saved Games ----------- I\u0027m not aware of any indication of when it actualy saves the game. But it does often fail to do so meaning you have to redo your work again when you next login. Map Size -------- I agree map sizes are way to small. To the extent it limits creativity and in my experience pushes you to playing each map in the same way. I do wonder if the beta was limited to 1 hour to avoid people realising this. Game speed ------------- Currently the game is limited to a max speed of 24 minutes per game day. This is quite important as it happens. If you play the game like I prefer to, start slow and build my city then you will spend many many hours just waiting for your cash to increase enough for your next purchase. On the other hand you can take the other approach (the one I feel you are forced to take) spam the entire map with residential and commercial with just enough industry and ignore all but the vital services (ie water and power). Then sit back and wait until you have lots of cash, demolish your city and build it how you wanted it in the first place. Either way there is a lot of waiting around doing nothing. Power and Water system ---------------------- I actually like this aspect of the game, I didn\u0027t enjoy having to lay all the pipes and powerlines, too much micromanagement for me. The new system of using the roads for everything works very well for me. Apart that is from what I assume are bugs. For example I had my city running along nicely I left the city and when I came back to it suddenly the game decided that I no longer had a massive excess of power but instead a massive deficit I had to plop 20 more windmills just to break even??? Bugs ---- The game still contains a number of bugs, mostly minor but some are not, for example you may get locked out of a map due to \u0027processing\u0027 never to be able to play that map again. This of course could in turn screw up your entire region causing many many hours of gameplay to be simply wasted. Multiplayer ----------- Sure you can let someone play a map in you region but don\u0027t be fooled this is a single player game. The global market? This boils down to the price you pay when you buy resources. Is it really influenced by other players? I don\u0027t know but it really makes no difference. If you need to buy resources then you pay the price the game tells you. That\u0027s it. Disasters --------- I\u0027ve never been a fan of these. I don\u0027t see anyway of turning them off in a normal game. Why such a big deal? At 24 minutes per game day it took me about 1.5 hours to save for my school that\u0027s 1.5 hours of me doing nothing but let the game run. As soon as I plopped it down and earthquake hit and destroyed it. So I started the wait all over again. Guess what, another earth quake and destroyed again. I had a further three disasters in that session. I estimate about 7 hours gameplay of which about 6.5 hours was just letting the game run to save up money. Which is why you should just use the spam method to build up lots of cash at the start which makes a mockery of the economy in the first place. Replayability ------------ If I\u0027m honest I was getting bored by the end of my first session but I stuck with it. Overall there is lot of frustration from losing work and even entire maps but the number one problem by far is the tiny map size which limits creativity and gameplay possibilities. I\u0027m going to give the game a little more time but I do feel I\u0027ve got pretty much all I\u0027m going get from it a far cry from past sim city games which I would play for months if not years. Always Online -------------- I didn\u0027t buy Diablo because of this but took a chance here. From what I understand things like map size and game speed and limited to reduce the load on their servers. The irony is that I bought myself an expensive laptop so I could play all the latest games but for this game I could have stuck with with my old crappy one. My experience with this game has convinced me that I won\u0027t be buying any more games that require this, at least, not for a single player game. Overall ------- If you are on the fence then wait until the price comes down before you consider trying it it is WAY overpriced at the moment and certainly not as stable as it should be. While it certainly a pretty game it is failing to hold my attention.… ",

When I got SimCity 2000Electronic Arts recently informed people to stop promoting this game less than a week in stores, and while that speaks volumes, I\u0027m here to share my own experiences with this game and the entire SimCity series. That experience goes all the way back April of 1990, when I started with SimCity Classic, and this was a game I loved that I played for hours upon hours. When I got SimCity 2000 in 1994, it was not only as addictive, but it was also better with the choice of density for Residential, Commercial, and Industrial zones (RCI as it\u0027s long since been dubbed) and signs to give names to streets and landmarks. SimCity 3000 (which I got in 1998) took away signs, and even without the arcologies that SimCity 2000 had, it was still an even better game and extremely fun to play. Then in 2004, i got the Deluxe Edition of SimCity 4, and the difficulty of the game made it less enjoyable, but I still had fun playing SC4, and really enjoyed everything that was right with the game. All of this changed in 2013 with the modern SimCity game! Even with the always online feature, I figured I can at least play alone, because the box said so. Something the game\u0027s box does not have written on it, is that the saved game files are not stored on the player\u0027s computer, and the player as at the whim for when the game is saved., and I honestly never would have bought the game if only I had known these things. I\u0027ve had computers break my heart because they were too underpowered for some games (or lacked hard drive space), but SimCity was truly the first video game to succeed in breaking my heart for being the exact opposite of what all other SimCity games were (and still are), which is a city builder to obsess over! Another thing with the modern SimCity game, is that it\u0027s also been the first game in nearly thirty years of video gaming that I gave up on before I could even play it. While I was ok with needing to be online to play at first, the difficult to access game servers (at least in the game\u0027s first week of release in America) clearly establishes a double standard: EA/Maxis expects players to always be online to play the game, but at the same time, players cannot expect the servers to always be online in order to play the game whenever they wish. If any good comes out of this, I hope that the corporate suits realize what exactly is wrong with software that requires the user to always be online, and that software pirates are never going to go away. (Not that I\u0027m a pirate or condone software piracy, but I\u0027ve known about piracy going on for as long as I\u0027ve first had a computer in 1986.)… ",

The graphics are beautiful and the game play has a lot of polish and fun factor. We spent an entire weekend lost in the fun of nurturing our towns and taking pride in our metropolises. The DRM issue is offensive, the day 1 server problems were inexcusable, and the handling by EA has been somewhat contemptible. (EA refuses refunds to customers who bought the game directly from them and couldn\u0027t play it due to EA\u0027s incompetent server scheme!) But, all that said, chances are none of these thing will affect your enjoyment moving forward. The actual game is largely as good as you hoped it would be. The city land size is not huge, but it\u0027s sufficient for an interesting city to be built. Being able to follow your citizens around in full 3D really makes you feel invested in the community you\u0027re creating. The amount of detail can be a bit mind blowing. Yet there are still several issues you should be aware of: // Game Breaking Problems: - Water is a finite resource, sometimes shockingly limited, and there is no way to import it from outside the region. The workaround seems to be to have a sewage outflow pipe dump sewage in the ground, and have a water pump with only filtered pump modules running next to it. This is pretty lame. - Recycling Centers are bugged, causing them to stop working, and leading to a pile up of recyclable garbage that is followed by massive ground pollution and a crippling health pandemic. - Traffic becomes very difficult to mitigate in a city of only 200 thousand residents. There are no highways you can build, only avenues, and every intersection results in more stop and go bottlenecks. If you make a road higher capacity, that is intrinsically connected with allowing higher density buildings there. So better roads actually causes more traffic there, and don\u0027t fix the problem for long. - Sims on the road don\u0027t yield to emergency vehicles. Soon crime, fire, and health problems can\u0027t be kept in check because all service vehicles all stuck in traffic with their sirens on. Garbage collection also starts to fail completion due to traffic, and also because garbage collectors seem to only randomly wander looking for trash to collect. Thus adding more garbage trucks to one garbage center becomes less and less helpful, since they tend to clump up near that center and follow each other around, leaving distant areas without any coverage. Adding a second center, even one with no dump of its own, seems to help. The region\u0027s Wind speed starts dramatically dying down after a few game years, making wind play like an unrealistically limited resource. Annoyances: - The game must be played by connecting to one of the (now many) EA servers. These servers don\u0027t coordinate at all. You might start a city on one server, and later find it is too crowded to connect. EA says \"just connect to a different one\", but then that server won\u0027t have your city available, and perhaps your friends are still on the first server. Even worse, the first time you connect to each server, it makes you play through the first time player tutorial all over again. The sim is great about showing you how things are right now. But it\u0027s hard to appreciate this in context with practically no historical data available. There no longer seem to be any graphs over time, aside from population, unlike the past SimCity games. I would really like to observe cause and effect by charting things like ground pollution over time alongside health problems over time. Or city income compared to education levels over time, or any of a large number of things. - You can\u0027t upgrade a road to an avenue without destroying every building on that road. If this is your $150K municipal building, too bad, you\u0027ll have to destroy and rebuild it.… ",

So you get to build a city and trade resources and services with other cities. That\u0027s a pretty good idea, and it was implemented rather successfully in Simcity 4, so it makes sense to add an online multiplayer aspect to that portion of the game. However, intercity trade is horribly buggy. You can initiate trade with another city and not see the results of this for several hours. Given that this mechanic is the foundation of the game\u0027s required online component, it\u0027s terrible execution severely damages the game from the outset. Beyond that, the act of building up your own city features a wealth of bugs and poor design decisions as well. The agent-based simulation, while a cool idea, is extremely processor intensive. The average computer this game is designed for simply cannot handle enough agents to accurately simulate a city. Working within that constraint, Maxis has given us the smallest city maps to date for the franchise. They\u0027ve said that they\u0027re the size of Simcity 4\u0027s medium maps, but in game this simply does not seem to be the case. You will run out of room, and despite what others have said, this is not a fun challenge to overcome. To make matters worse the regions have huge spaces between cities that mock your overcrowded city map and cause a fully developed region to look ridiculous in the process. Additionally, the resource extraction and utilization mechanic is a truly odd addition to the franchise. I suppose in Soviet Russia it makes sense for a city to run a television factory, but it is simply out of place in Simcity. It would have made infinitely more sense to require the mayor of a resource-rich city to balance business, industrial, and environmental from a governmental perspective instead of allowing the player to open their own mining operation. Also, once the supply chain is set up selling electronics is game-breakingly profitable, to the tune of millions of simoleons per day. I won\u0027t go into detail on the issue of DRM, but suffice it to say the forced online component would be a bad idea even if it worked properly. However, this game would also fail as a single-player game, so there really isn\u0027t anything of value lost due to the always-online restriction.… ",

    "comments": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view. I pre-ordered and deliberately waited a week before reviewing to give EA a chance to bounce back from their self-inflicted launch debaucle. After that, my rating is still \"meh\". Though I give credit to their server team for standing up so many servers so quickly and a furrow of my brow to whatever management bean-counter prevented them from doing so prior to the launch. As of writing, Origin says I have 121 hours played, but some of that is just watching my my city burn and playing until 5 am (as that\u0027s when you can actually get on the servers) Some of the positives: When they said they\u0027d be tracking every sim, I feared this would turn out more like the Sims, which was only fun when you mercilessly took away the only pool ladders. However, being able to click on any car travelling on the map and see where it\u0027s going, whether it has spending money, and follow it is actually pretty neat. Region play. It was in Sim City 4 to some extent, but it\u0027s cool to have all the cities work together to build great works. And with it, Multiplayer is a great idea. Sometimes I like a little teamwork, or to flood my neighbouring city with murderers and arsonists. Finite resources. Go ahead put all your eggs into the oil mining business and plop some high tax entitlements like education and fire safety for a better society. What\u0027s the worst that could happen? Tip: Diversify and plan for renewable income before the well runs dry Some of the negatives: DRM always on requirement. When I\u0027m not sabotaging my neighbors, sometimes I like to play with myself and I want to build my Dystopian region without the condescending glares of my neighbors. But even as I write this a week after launch, I cannot log into Sim City to do so. One tip, if you get logged in, stay logged in. While you\u0027re playing you\u0027ll see \"server disconnected\" messages happen all the time, but then they\u0027ll reconnect and presumably everything will be peachy. If you disconnect, however, it\u0027s much harder to get connected and a region loaded. Difficulty. It\u0027s not. Pretty much any city (except one I\u0027m playing now which it about 50% water) can be turned into a cash cow pretty easily. If your planning right, the only thing that throws you a curve is the occasional disaster. I like the idea of the global market, but as near as I can tell, there are hard lines at the minimum prices for buying and selling that pretty much guarantee you can make a ton of profit buying (then refining, smelting, producing) and reselling. I guess it\u0027d be nice if there were bad investments. The only way to screw that up is misjudging your input or output rate, or bottlenecking your supply line. City Size. You run out of room fast. Because it\u0027s so easy to make money, you end up bulging at the borders in no time and your city become. Region play. The idea of region play is great. The implementation of region play is still a little off. Nothing is more frustrating than overloading a city with sweet nuke plants and the other cities in the region not recognizing that there is power available to buy. Or when collaborating on a great work, some cities will recognize that all of a specific resource (metal, allow, oil) has been provided, while others do not or only see that half has been provided. Multiple servers. Spreading out the load was a great idea to increase server availability. The downside is that the regions aren\u0027t shared between servers. So, if you\u0027ve spent countless hours building a perfect replica of Trenton, New Jersey and that server is unavailable, EA supports answer is try a different server (where your region does not exist and you get to start all over). The result of this is a bunch of cities in the public regions that don\u0027t look like people are playing them. So it ends up as a Multiplayer environment where you\u0027re the only one on. Summary: After 10 years, they fell on their face at the starting line, but were able to get an Ok game out. They\u0027ve hinted at some changes (bigger cities is the last one I heard), but I suspect a lot of these enhancements will cost you real-world Simoleans.… ",

But this release is my personal disappointment of the year. I can even predict that nothing 2013 will disapoint me more, because what simcity did is the worst \"design-mistake\" someone can actually do. 1. Small Cities. Maxis is lieing at us saying that bigger cities arent possible because of performance restrictions the engine gives us. Thats wrong. The real problem is their DRM always online stuff. They save our cities locally on THEIR servers. Youre not able to create a local savegame. If we would be able to have local savegames, the game would actually easily run on 10 times bigger cities. But because they had to bring in their always online DRM protection they accept smaller cities wich results in a much smaller long-term fun level. 2. Savegames. Savegames on their servers? Why? To sync your city region to the other players? Thats maybe a good thing but it\u0027s implemented poorly. Sometimes you just disconnect from a server or they have a maintenance running. If you continue playing now have fun seeing your city rolled back hours when you reload your savegame later. Or the savegame is gone fully. Why not create some kind of backup savegame locally? That could\u0027nt be too hard. Just sync it with the online servers the next time you login. 3. Server capacities. They try to fix the problem by adding more and more servers. They actually know that this wont help at all. Why? Simple: The single server capacity is just not enough. I\u0027ve read in a post that one server can take about 90.000 people. Ive no clue if thats true. I dont even care. But even if a server is able to take half a million players, it will result in problems. Always. What they are aiming for is was your money. Now they have it they wait until a few players drop the game because they are frustrated. On Twitter they only answer to \"lol look at my city\". Like everything\u0027s fine. Then, sometimes they say \"Hey look theres a new server online! Check it out!\". You enter the server and you see the next worst possible design idea ever: The savegames are\u0027nt even synced to other servers. You have to begin a new Savegame on every single server. If your server is full (lets say 90k people play on it), you come back from work and just want to play simcity for another hour you just simply cant. Well you can.. begin a new city. But you can not continue your current city. What the hell Maxis, what the hell. 4. \"Experts\". These people call themselves experts developing such games. Why. Why the hell are these people even allowed to be called like that. Not thinking about the single server capacity why are they miscalculating the load on the first few days? Why are they panicing NOW when its much too late that theres not enough server capacity. Why are they acting like its a big problem to bring up a few more servers online within just one day? Well, if they are doing it right the only thing should actually be setting up a simple server and run their server software wich registers another server in some central server so the players are able to see it. I bet they are\u0027nt even able to do that. They did some hypercomplicated piece of non optimized software. I am pretty sure. 5. The game will never run properly. Why? Simply because this kind of game is not able to work out properly. Savegames will disappear as soon as theres a maintenance. And there will always be one. Your cities roll back. You come back from work and your server is crowded. You cannot play. You probably find the time to play it once a week. If youve the time your server is just full and you\u0027re done with it. Next week the same. Also: An offline patch is probably not even possible because of their weird system. It would take \"too much efford\" to make a singleplayer game singleplayer (offline). If youve a nice savegame on a server wich is usually more crowded you can actually forget about it. You will never have fun with this savegame anymore. Savegame port on another server is not possible. Its also not syncing as said earlier. 6. The game itself. The game itself is also actually poorly made, mainly because of these small cities, wich could be soooo pretty and big but because of DRM and online restrictions they will never be able to reach a proper size. The game feels pretty okay but if you play it for more than two hours you can easily realise how poorly it\u0027s made im a coder myself i know alot about whats cheap and whats not Simcity shall be called a pretty facebook game thats it. 7. I\u0027ve had trust in them to make it properly. But this once again shows me has proven me that even multi billion companies are not able to properly create a good and also brainful online experience. Never again. Never.… ",

That\u0027s basically the DRM issue but from a 1990 point of view. Otherwise I\u0027m a UK player and have only had to wait 20 minutes for servers to be working. And I\u0027ve played well over 30 hours. So no real launch issues as far as I\u0027m aware. As for the game it is ludicrously addictive! Everything you already know from the SimCity world, but tweaked in new ways. The smaller city size is limiting in some ways but it adds a new level of addiction an playability because those individual Cities can share resources which means you now no longer begin a new city and just go through the motions now you have an objective to your new city. Maybe you need to outsource sewage or rubbish to another city, or maybe you need a University. Because of the limits in the map size it means you cannot place everything in one City which means you have to be more tactical about your placements. Oh and word of advice don\u0027t place a University on a City, leave it a few hours and then delete it Industrial get right uppity about it and complain about unskilled workers! I really do like this game a lot. Too much, I couldn\u0027t stop playing it. Once you get passed the initial city building stages and you are getting better residents in, the balancing act of money and resources is quite a difficult one requiring a fair amount of attention. And before you know it 18 hours have gone in the real world. I\u0027m a big fan of the Tropico series (Though what the difference between 3 and 4 was....I have no idea) and so far I think SimCity is going to trump Tropico in terms of longevity and charm. Because it is really rather charming in most respects. But don\u0027t listen to me and don\u0027t listen to any of the DRM nay-sayers either, because they\u0027re not reviewing the game!

I have spent a lot of time in this game, I made a city with over 400,000 people in it, I filled up the map with an oil drilling city, I filled up the map with a city of almost nothing but high-density, high-wealth commercial and residential with landmarks making tons of tourist money, I made a mining city making tons of money selling alloy. Making them was great. It\u0027s too bad I can\u0027t play those last 2 now. Both of them are lost somewhere in that big, origin cloud in the sky. The only reason I\u0027m on metacritic right now is because I just can\u0027t bring myself to make another city, pouring 10-15 hours into something that when I load it the next day it\u0027s going to tell me that it can\u0027t process correctly and then it completely disappears such that I can\u0027t even see the road connecting it when I\u0027m in my city next door. I\u0027l start with my list of gripes. 1) They said that people\u0027s lives were going to be simuated; they\u0027d have names, jobs, homes. Well, that\u0027s true. They wake up in a home in the morning, you follow them to work. But keep watching. That night they go to the closest empty house, the next day someone with a different name leaves that house and goes to the closest empty job which is not the same as it was yesterday. Their \"simulation\" isn\u0027t simulating anything. 2) While this is a relaunch, it\u0027s missing key components from previous games. Most visibly, terraforming. There\u0027s a city in one region where you can\u0027t build anything but a 1x8 strip of road and maybe 10 houses and the rest is a giant mesa that\u0027s too steep for a road to go up. 3) The obvious part from earlier about my cities keep going missing. 4) You will run out of water. Your entire region WILL run out of water. There is nothing you can do about it. 5) I can\u0027t save my game on my PC. Now always-online doesn\u0027t bother me as long as servers are up (I haven\u0027t had a big problem with that), but I\u0027ve been playing SimCity for 18 years and sometimes you just have to back up 30 minutes and start again. Plus I always enjoyed filling up a map with a giant city and then setting off all the disasters at once before I went to bed at night. When I got up, I\u0027d reload the game and be right back where I was before the disaster. Here, you don\u0027t get that, what happens, happens. At least in WoW, which incidentally is also always online and doesn\u0027t save locally, there is nothing I can do short of deleting my toon that will completely destroy my gameplay (and I can even undo character deletion if I open a ticket). No local save Great chance of failure. 6) The city is too small. I don\u0027t care what anyone thinks, the city is too small. On every other Sim City game I always chose the largest city, why in the world would I ever want just a kinda big city or itty bitty city? I wouldn\u0027t. 7) Everything HAS to be next to a road. You can\u0027t build a residential square and put a park in the middle of it (unless you just plop a piece of road next to it as well), and you can\u0027t upgrade from a 4 lane to a divided 4 lane or move your road over 1 space (to keep in line with the rest of the city) without destroying every building along it. There\u0027s too much stuff for me to continue without saying what I like about it. So, what I like about it 1) I like that the roads are the pipes and the power lines. It simplifies things, but doesn\u0027t over-simplify. 2) I like how (when working) if you\u0027ve built a university or fully upgraded your town hall in one city in the region, the benefits spread to the rest of the region. 3) Though I have to care about how happy everyone is, I\u0027m glad I don\u0027t have to REALLY care about how happy they are like in SC4. 4) As I\u0027m going over things in my head now, I realize what I like about it is the fact that it\u0027s SimCity. There\u0027s not anything in particular about this specific game that I can point out that is special and working that I like. Just building a city and watching it grow and change is the only reason I\u0027ve made 4 full map cities (well, that and I keep having to start over since they keep disappearing). I could probably at this moment reinstall SC3k and not be nearly as disappointed.… ",

The traffic and AI is not just challenging, as I first thought it was, it\u0027s just broken. It completely ruins your sense of success in building a thriving city. Sure, you can get around it with exploits and bugs like only zoning residential with some parks, or dirt access roads for trade express lanes, but it just sucks that you can\u0027t just build a big badass city and have things work right the way they should. The game is fun for a while, or if you aren\u0027t really hardcore about it, but I can\u0027t recommend it to any of my friends that have previously played the franchise. It\u0027s bad news, pick it up in the bargain bin in 6 months. Maybe they will have fixed a couple things by then.… ",

Look: http://answers.ea.com/t5/Miscellaneous-Issues/Traffic-quot-AI-quot-This-is-why-services-and-traffic-are-broken/m-p/737060#U737060 There are no Sims living in your town. They are just mindless bots, going to the next free house and the next free shop and the next free working place. And this is why this game has so much flaws. Traffic jams, empty shops and casinos altough everything is full. If you build a car lot besides a casino, no sim will go into the casino. They will take the bus to the next free shop. This game is mindless like any other EA games of the early past. Don\u0027t buy this stuff.… ",

Home \"B\" and then repeating this randomly every day, pathfinding for traffic terrible. Waste not clearing, cash limits \"sticking\". The logic of the game is just plain BROKEN all over the place. The list could go on and on and on. For the first 90 minutes you are thinking \"This is a good game. Looks good, if the servers OK I\u0027m going to enjoy this\"... Then WHAM the logic somewhere trips you up and often it\u0027s a game ending error. Nothing to do with servers or online logic issues these are pure and simple game logic errors and LOTS OF THEM. As for online multiplay. Sharing a zone is a nightmare without some sort of \"mind control\" over your fellow players. Everyone has to build at the same rate for this to work. and display co-ordination and co-operatiion over the long term consistent communication and really playing \"one way\" that would need to be pre decided before the game begins. It almost requires separate coms software and tracking to get this to work even then, if a player stops playing, wants to experiment, or comes across a problem and doesn\u0027t communicate quickly your own \"city\" (tiny village) is most likely on a downward spiral to collapse as a result. And this happens...every game. Rely on someone to provide your power? Well make sure he or she is playing and expanding at about the same rate and at the same time as you or BAM it goes out of the window. Same with waste same with EVERYTHING. You need almost superhuman co-ordination to get a 15 player map to any decent level using multiplayer. It\u0027s darn hard with 3! Then you realize why goods appear from no-where at zero cost. Maxis knew the game logic was bust and hid 1/3rd of the issue by making these phantom products for \"C\" districts to sell. But didn\u0027t apply the same \"bodge\" fixes to \"I\" or \"R\" (perhaps becasue that would have let the cat out of the bag too early as far as botched game mechanics go) For me the idea of global market multiplayer seems quite atractive. I would go online for that for sure. It WOULD bring a new facet to the game. I would hope it was optional. But that is academic. It doesn\u0027t work and it\u0027s not just a \"little bit\" broke go deep enough into any facet of the game and it will unravel into a mess of faulty logic and counter intuitive reactions from your Sims. My two pence worth is Maxis \"shoe horned\" multiplayer functionality in sometime mid 2012 to justify always online DRM. And botched the logic..BADLY. I\u0027d like to say probably at the request of EA but I have no idea whether that would be true or not. The sad thing is all of this worked (and still does) with Sim City 4. A ten year old game that works almost flawlessly to this day and is what I\u0027m playing on my other monitor as I type this.… ",

I found as long as you follow the basics everything falls into place start small and work your way up to big.

I\u0027ve owned the game for over a week now, but due to the fact that you have to be able to connect to the EA servers to play even a single player game, I have been unable to play the game for at least half the time I have possessed it. Even on the days that it has been working, I\u0027m often unable to start new cities or save the existing one because I will get disconnected while playing the game. It\u0027s also not uncommon to have to sit in a queue for up to two hours to connect to one of the servers. As your cities are not shared between servers, you\u0027re stuck if you want to continue a particular city. As there is no ability to manually save your city, you are completely at the mercy of the network connection to EA in order to save your game, and you can\u0027t control when it saves. It\u0027s not uncommon for a city to simply be annihilated by disasters with no real ability to recover. You also cannot terraform land as you could in Simcity 4, Simcity 3000, and even Simcity 2000. This means that your stuck with whatever land mass that they give you to work with, and not even a map generator, only premade regions. The map size is limited to 2km x 2km which is quite small, likely smaller than Simcity 4\u0027s medium size, which is far too small for the scope of this game. The AI is broken such that you cannot get the city much over 200,000 people without the entire city falling apart due to the poor traffic AI that apparently uses Shortest Path First routing which causes total gridlock. The AI\u0027s ability to poorly coordinate your emergency services cannot be understated, it\u0027s nearly impossible to put out more than one fire at a time for example. It\u0027s not even worth building more than one fire department. In short, EA appears to have stolen $65 from me, and many thousands of other individuals who are equally displeased with the situation. They have broken one of the most successful game franchises, typically the best examples of the simulation genre, and show no remorse, and no sign that they really have any intention of fixing it.… ",

I am just an avid gamer. I hold no grudges against any developers or publishers, although, as in this case, it\u0027s pretty evident when one, or both, of them slips up. EA undeniably soured the release of an otherwise sweet game with SimCity, albeit not in the usual way they\u0027re accused of. But when we look passed the Always Online DRM, how much of gamers\u0027 quibbles with SimCity are actually EA\u0027s fault? To begin, there have been some redeeming things EA have done (or tried to do) in response to all the anger and frustration aimed at them. On March 18th for instance, \"a free PC download game from the EA portfolio\" will be available to all active SimCity users. It took less than three days (which by industry standards is blazing fast) to drastically improve server load and performance and increase the total number of servers. How long has Crysis 3 been out? Black Ops 2? Have they even acknowledged the issues with their servers? (For those who don\u0027t know what I mean by this, I have been unable to get a consistently lag-free connection with either those games in multiplayer, especially Black Ops 2, and it\u0027s certainly not my IP) But let\u0027s focus on the major complaints from gamers regarding SimCity: small city sizes, forced multiplayer, micro-transactions, inability to save/load on HDD, and Day One DLC. At least one of these isn\u0027t even true, and all seem quite clearly to me as design choices made by the developer, Maxis. Let\u0027s get two of the easy complaints out of the way; privatizing a game is as simple as checking a box, and I have yet to find ANY micro-transaction opportunity (I don\u0027t even see what purpose they\u0027d serve beyond catering to the laziest of players), and even if they were everywhere, they\u0027re little more than a purchasable cheat, having no effect on gameplay for those who choose to ignore them. Day One DLC can be controversial, but really? This \"DLC\" is a tourist attractions package of sorts that offers real-world wonders and buildings such as the Eiffel Tower. Unless you want to recreate Paris, there is absolutely nothing you\u0027re missing out on. SimCity was always a creative game where you built cities from your imagination. The inablitiy to save onto a private hard disk is kind of dumb but necessary to the whole idea of a pseudo-MMO city simulator. Your cities breathe and produce and work with (or against) other players and their cities. That can\u0027t happen if players can simply load a past save when something doesn\u0027t go their way. I personally like this feature and don\u0027t mind that my saves are located in a \"cloud\" instead of a physical disk (although the option for both would certainly be preferable). The lack of a save/load feature, however, is a direct result of the more fundamental design choice regarding online play, one that I find very implausible was forced upon Maxis by EA. Many of the game\u0027s design choices in general stem from the questionable decision to make SimCity an \"online game,\" like Diablo III or even Guild Wars, which is decision made by Maxis. And if you insist that EA forced Maxis to make SimCity online only from the reboot\u0027s inception, then I find it very hard to believe Maxis couldn\u0027t get the as big a game as SimCity published under another company that didn\u0027t choose to force online play, if they were against the idea that is. The final complaint and also my personal gripe is indeed the city size. They\u0027re simply too small. The ability to connect multiple cities, using them in tandem to create a mega city, does help mend this but there should be an option to extend city boundaries, or at least a game mode where the limit is removed. A recent interview with a lead game designer from Maxis states that they intend to increase the size limits \"eventually.\" Now, EA has been receiving the blame for this design choice since the beta, when it\u0027s quite clear to me Maxis should be receiving the brunt of it. I don\u0027t quite understand why anyone would even sneer in EA\u0027s direction on this one; am I to assume their unabashed greed somehow accounts for them not allowing Maxis to increase the city limits? I don\u0027t see how it earns them a profit; in fact it\u0027s done the opposite. In the end, EA screwed up big time with the servers, but they\u0027ve made evident and serious attempts to rectify their mistake (at least I feel that way). Meanwhile, Maxis has gotten out seeming guilt-less, when it seems they\u0027re liable for most of the complaints. True, the DRM needs to go, not only from EA but industry-wide (I\u0027m looking at you Blizzard). I\u0027m judging the game for what it is in it\u0027s current playable state, a solid 7. Given time for updates and player mods, I\u0027m sure this game will be incredible and the city limits will hopefully be expanded sooner rather than later.… ",

Vehicles and Sims take completely insensible paths to reach their destinations. This leads to traffic jams all the time which shouldn\u0027t exist. School buses run empty but don\u0027t pick up children because they are full. Emergency vehicles get stuck in traffic, and also drive past their destination because they\u0027re on the wrong side of the road. These are just specific examples of how the game\u0027s AI is terrible. Thirdly, thanks to EA hating single-player games, and trying to make this an always-on multiplayer game, the amount of space you have to build your city is pathetic. It looks more like SimVille: The Facebook Game than a respectable PC game. I was looking for a modern, updated version of Simcity 2000 and Simcity 4. With today\u0027s graphics and CPU power, we could have built sprawling metropolises with stunning graphics. Instead, we have this pile of rubbish.

Traffic is a hideous monster to control and if you do by some miracle manage to organised it the game is incredibly easy. The only challenge is traffic management. It feels more and more like a glorified Facebook game without the social game requirements. Region trading is horrendously broken, commuters commute but when they do the traffic is so horrendous because you only have one entrance to your city. EVEN WITH mass transit maxed out including trains and boats, it\u0027s just ridiculous. The online requirements suck too, I\u0027ve lost a 9 hour city due to the servers. Also the region play is rubbish due to the servers, I was playing a region with my girlfriend (hot seat style) and I waited TEN MINUTES for the servers to update our own singleplayer region so I could send power to my girlfriends city. This is just dumb, it isn\u0027t fun. tldr: it starts out very fun but after you get over the \"creativity\" aspect of creating a city it becomes very boring and very broken. Might be good in a few months when it\u0027s patched although many features are not as advertised (such as \"full simulation\" which is a flat out lie). The DRM just makes everything worse.… ",

There are TONS of issues, and most of them only become apparent after a few hours of play. I suspect the beta was less about finding and squashing bugs, and more about publicity. I\u0027ve had every single sim become homeless for no apparent reason, hundreds of thousands of simoleans disappear from my treasury, buses and trade centers refuse to work despite there being no traffic, and power to cities going out upon logging, taking several in-game days before it decides to turn on again. The list goes on. Now, the SimCity franchise is no stranger to bugs, but these are literally game-ending because there is no save ability. There are questionable gameplay mechanics too, such as the inter-connectivity of cities, where a single \u0027bad\u0027 player can ruin a game, or the crippling simplicity of the transit, job and housing system. The latter has only become apparent in the last few days, and it indicates everything Maxis/EA told us about sophisticated AI and massive amounts of route calculations was a lie.

What this means is that your important mining industry on the other side of town will keep closing due to worker shortages, while some citizens will still complain they couldn\u0027t find a job. The only way for a player to fix this is by meticulous trial and error or by making the city have only one winding snake-like avenue with a good distribution of zones so that it\u0027s impossible for citizens to not find the local shopping and industry every day.

Other things that are broken (such as multiplayer), is broken and will be for a very long time until they fix the servers and fix the way cities interact within regions. Things that are missing, EA will probably sell them for bucks (subway, zoo, etc etc). In summary, they didn\u0027t deliver what they promised to, and while it is fine that they wanted to build from ground up, it doesn\u0027t mean you take contents out of your previous simcity.

Even if you *can* stomach the always-online DRM that\u0027s been spun as \"a rich social experience,\" you can\u0027t help but notice that (a) the \"rich\" social experience is clearly incidental to the core game play, and (b) it doesn\u0027t actually work 10 days after launch. That means the decision to force-feed the consumer a dubious collection of non-functional features was clearly made by someone in a suit who\u0027s never actually played a game. What makes the promotion of these \"rich\" online features particularly painful is that they are offered in place of a wide variety of features found in earlier SimCity games. You can\u0027t place one-way roads, you can\u0027t zone mixed density along a single street, you can\u0027t use subways, the cities aren\u0027t as large as the tiniest maps available previous incarnations, there are no city ordinances, there are no histograms for age groups, education levels the list goes on. It\u0027s sickening to read a review of SimCity 4 and compare the features of that game to this travesty. The next complete failure in this title is the much-hyped simulation itself: GlassBox. Everything in the simulation sims, stundents, garbage trucks, buses *everything* is simulated using the same logic they use to simulate the sewage that flows in pipes under the city. Maxis said this explciticly. And the quality of traffic, power, water coverage, and all the rest are a complete trainwreck. But the worst part about this game\u0027s release? There is no game. There is no strategy. The entire concept of balancing the needs of your city is completely gone. You don\u0027t need industrial. You don\u0027t need commercial. In fact, you can build massively profitable cities using only a few service buildings, residential zoning, and some parks. That\u0027s it. And the developers are standing by this joke of simulation as \"working as designed.\" NO ONE should EVER buy a game that was so badly designed, so ineptly delivered, or so grossly deceptive in its marketing. Maxis has burned SimCity and salted the ground I can only pray they never attempt a sequel.… ",

So they can sell badly written games which are not functional and get away with it, essentially stealing your money for a fraudulent claim of the product being complete. I\u0027ve been trying to play the game online in multiplayer mode, that is not on my own singleplayer, and can never get it to work. The reason? Apparently the sim city limited edition does not filter out the servers or cities used by players who have different buildings and a different copy of the game. So this annoying message will come up very often when trying to reclaim an abandoned city. The only way is to make a game yourself or find an empty slot, but that has been in fact very hard and almost impossible. The \"Load more\" button for the available games is badly thought out, and being thrown off 30 or so times is extremely annoying. There is no way to tell if the city is abandoned or not until you click on it. What is this madness? Many claims and updates from Maxis, but I esssentially feel robbed. Added to this I have been told that I have no statutory rights, which is as usual the general illegal EA way. I think they should not get away with it this time so am giving an extremely negative review to boycott this game. Since my right to a refund was apparently waived when I signed the origin agreement., This is criminal and at best fraudulently nefarious activity by a software developer and publisher that should know better.

To top it all off, one and a half weeks after the game was finally activated on my account, Origin asked me to \"re-activate\" Simcity and asked for a product key. When I tried entering the product key I paid for, Origin advised me that the code has already been used. When I contacted Electronic Arts, I was told there was nothing they could do. This game truly deserves a 1 star rating due to its lack of features and extremely poor handling of its release by Electronic Arts.… ",

There are only really 4 hours of gameplay, and cities don\u0027t connect properly throughout the region. I found the longest it took (even in the most prime city locations) to cap out my city, to the point where I could no longer build anything (because of space) and every building was upgraded to a skyscraper, with max tech, was four hours. Within four hours I was generating millions of dollars every 20 minutes or so, and the only thing I could do is start over. Which may be fine for some people, but keep in mind that when you start over, you can either pick from one of the 3 cities connected to yours, or start over completely in a city that is not connected, but within the same zone. Here is the catch. Those three cities that are connected, will all be in terrible locations. They will either be riddled with mountains, minimizing your space. Or divided completely by Water, using up your space. The cities are just too small to really get in-depth, and sink hours into this game. That wouldn\u0027t be such a big problem if every city in the region connected, but they don\u0027t. And since this game focuses on multiplayer so much, the cities that are connected to you will likely be taken up by your friends. Thus this game gets a 3. It\u0027s fun, for four hours, then it sucks. Don\u0027t bother. This is nothing like Simcity 4, it is at least 4 steps in the wrong direction. Everything is oversimplified to the point where the bulk of your time is spent sitting, waiting for money to come in, and occasionally demolishing an abandoned building.… ",

You can at first but demand makes you need to create packed in dense cities that all end up looking the same. You have the tools to be able to, like different class ranges but the city is far too small to do that. Plus specialist cities? No, I want option of all in one like LA, which has everything. 3rd mark down is for little things missing like subway, little bugs, I don\u0027t like the big works idea, I just want a full airport \u0027in\u0027 my city, no bridges when you want them etc...

Let alone the incredibly horrible and incompetent launch, the always online DRM and the small maps, the game itself is broken and should never have been released in its current state. Let me emphasize that if you do buy the game; know that you’ll feel like you’re participating in a beta test and not a finished product. First, the traffic system does not work and it creates traffic hell. And hey you can’t alleviate it with a subway system, but what you can do is create a snake like road system with no interactions so the AI does not screw itself over. Also, the sewage system is broken (it seems like it follows the same pathing as traffic, that is ALWAYS taking the shortest route even though there are other routes available), the power grid system is broken and the water system is broken too with similar issues as traffic. Even though you have plenty of capacity for these things, the engine does allow distribution between routes A, B and C, but only chooses one route, leading to congestion and full stop. And this did not show up in internal testing? Furthermore, if there is a disaster such as a fire, all your fire trucks are sent at the same time, often driving in weird circles or not arriving at the fire at all. Moving on, the regional trading system is also broken. If you send money to another city, know that the money arrives (if it arrives) several hours or maybe a day or two later. I have not tried sending any other resources in fear of losing them permanently. And then there’s the main problem, the RCI zoning issue. You can build a city completely made up of residential. No need for commercial zones and industrial because parks take care of the jobs! The developers have purposely created a game where residential zoning is independent of commercial zones; they only need industrial for jobs, and in the extreme case you only need parks. The fundamental core of the whole series is in shambles. And good luck with getting a refund if you bought this over origin, it’s impossible.… ",

All sims are agents, when they go to work they just enter the first building with an open job, when they go home enter the first home with open slot, if its full they move to the next one, just like mindless lemmings. Firetrucks and Police can only attend one event at the same time, meaning if you have 20 firetrucks, they all go to the same fire even if the other side of the town is burning down. You can have one city with only residential lots as long as you keep yous sims happy with parks. You don´t need commercial or industrial lots, as ridiculous as this sounds. And to the top of this, the ridiculous DRM which demands you to be always online while playing this \"game\". RIP Simcity, hello Simville CEO.… ",

Other things, like Cheetah Speed, are still missing, and regions are still shaky in their synchronization (even failing to save your work in rare cases). Everything above this paragraph will be fixed before long, that is guaranteed. The greater problem is the actual game. Not only is the balance of the gameplay mediocre at best; the actual simulations are horrible. Earlier SimCity games *tried* to simulate real cities, with varied success. This game, however, doesn\u0027t even try. There are no simulations of real-world behavior or city planning. Instead, the game is completely focused on the automated behavior of \"agents\" in a completely artificial system. At best, your population seems a bit dumb. At worst, your city becomes completely irrational, and requires you to build your city the *opposite* way of real cities. The game engine is fantastic, and the potential for great simulations is greater than any game I\u0027ve seen the last 20 years. In fact, the Glassbox engine is much more interesting and revolutionary than any Crytek, Unreal, or Frostbite engine. Not because of graphics, but because of gameplay. Unfortunately, the developers lack any knowledge of the subject matter they intend to simulate. And instead of hiring experts to help them out, they let AI programmers build systems that have nothing to do with real cities. The engine could have done great things, but it is fed with sub-par pathfinding and unrealistic behaviors. In the ends, you can have a lot of fun with the new SimCity. As long as you don\u0027t expect it to actually simulate cities.… ",

The latest blog post with \"straight answers\" is such a vile piece of trash that I cannot believe that anyone is buying the game and/or defending anyone at EA/Maxis. It\u0027s atrocious. It is a fact that EA confirmed there\u0027d be an offline mode and that multiplayer was simply optional for those who wanted that experience; multiplayer was not off the table. It was not a \"from the ground up\" quasi-MMO. That is an excuse made after it was so obvious that offline was easy to achieve and totally possible and even more fun. It\u0027s an excuse after realizing that the servers don\u0027t do much, and what they do is done so poorly that you\u0027re wasting your time. Nothing is in real-time. Nothing that couldn\u0027t be achieved faster from PC to PC. It\u0027s just such a crock.

The issues in this game are so fundamental, ridiculous and crippling there is no excuse as to why it was released in this state. I was addicted to it at first, LOVED IT, played it for hours on end. I built a crappy city, figured out the game, and started a new city. It flourished. Then it fell apart. I didn’t understand, at first… Nothing works. Here is how every aspect of the game does not work: City Service: I have three garbage dumps and maxed out garbage trucks in each one. And yet only 2/3rds of the trash in my city was being picked up. I followed a random truck to discover it only carried 0.1/5 tons back to the dump after driving past tons of buildings filled with trash, for no apparent reason. Several other trucks did the same thing. Crime was high in my city; to the point buildings were being abandoned. I built a police precinct and plopped ten patrol police cars. Only two go out on patrol every day. Though it still costs me over a thousand dollars an hour to pay for then ten cars, when only two are used. Never seen them use the helicopter either. As everyone else has said, fire trucks only respond to one fire at a time. Ten fire trucks at one fire, while the rest of your city burns down and a huge traffic jam is caused by those fire trucks. Resources: Then there was water. The water table does not replenish in this game. Simulation? In real life it rains. Fail. You have to make a sewage pipe and then a water treatment center next to it, to filter the dirty sewage water and reuse it in your city. However, the sewage pisses off everyone in your town, because you can no longer treat it and it smells. It doesn’t matter if the wind is blowing the opposite direction and your neighborhoods are on the other corner of the town, it still pisses them off. At least 5 buildings are abandoned EVERY SINGLE HOUR (one minute on fast speed) in my game, DUE TO SEWAGE! Trading doesn’t work with other regions. Civil Service: My town has every type of school there is. It has almost every department in the government. It has a hospital, an amazing public transportation system, a police precinct and the big fire station; as well as little ones to help cover the areas. When my city was doing well, I still made 5-6k an hour. When everyone abandoned it because of sewage and garbage not being picked up (thanks to the game’s issues, not me)I went into the red quick. I saw raising my taxes a couple percentages got me back in the green. I mean, my Sim’s are given ALL of the above FREE OF CHARGE, in return for only 9%? I think they could handle 12%. I mean I pay at least 30% in taxes, on top of paying for my own health care, public transport, college etc. Nope. Even more people abandoned due to “high taxes”. What a joke. If sims are so intolerant to taxes: Why even put that option in the game?? End story: This game is a nightmare. It’s depressing to play. It goes well and you have fun; only to watch your city self-destruct to crippling bugs. If they tested this game for more than an hour, they never should have released it with these issues. I don\u0027t care if they \"patch it\" that could take months and I just doubt it could fix problems that are so fundamental and extreme. The area you build in is tiny and the game has been simplified to be LESS than the one they made ten years ago. All to make EA money (smaller amounts of data for their servers and people with crap computers can buy the game). Please don’t buy this game.

(Most of you probably have your own opinions on this, and I\u0027ll bet 99% of you agree with me) So, the game itself... it is a more simplified game than SimCitys past. And when I say simplified, I mean really simplified in almost every way. For a newbie to simulation strategy games, then SimCity may be a decent start for you. The mechanics of the game are easy to learn. The sizes of your cities are tiny. Tiny to the point where if you know what you are doing, you will fill that entire space to maximum capacity within about 6 hours of game time. You can potentially have a city half covered in skyscrapers in that amount of time. That\u0027s with Llama speed too (the 2nd fastest game pace, and the fastest available as of writing). So, from there, you either keep growing in... or you make a new city. What does making a new city do? Well, it freezes your other city for starters (your city only progresses when YOU are inside of it), and you basically start a brand new city from complete scratch. Cities in the same region are connected in a sense, regions can share almost any asset possible, ranging from workers, to resources, to wealth. What happens in one city can also make impacts on the rest. Cities in the same region are very intertwined with each other. For example, I have a city in the same region as a friend. My friend is specializing in industry, however, I\u0027m specializing in tourism. Sadly, I\u0027m downwind of him, so all that air pollution he produces is making its way into my region, causing widespread illness. Luckily, hes willing to get those factories upgraded, but there is nothing I can do to force him. Are you seeing the pros and cons of this? On the topic of specializations, while we are mentioning it, they are helpful, but they don\u0027t feel significant. What I mean by that is, you could go ahead ignoring all city specializations and be fine. Maxis seemed to emphasize these, but they feel like an afterthought to me unless I am specifically looking for a coal mine or something. So, if you are a long time SimCity fan, this game is going to be a mixed bag. I\u0027m sure many of you will enjoy some of the enhancements, but I\u0027m also certain that that same many of you will loathe a lot more of them. My final score is 4/10. SimCity is a game that has a lot going for it, but the complexity has been diminished severely and relying on the SimCity servers is a pain (I guarantee the servers WILL be the thing you will hate most about SimCity). Otherwise, the game itself plays well when the servers are working.… ",

Say bye bye to EVERYTHING on that road, EVEN IF you _instantly_ replace the road. Not only that, but even parks and ponds need road access, since it would be utterly impossible for people to walk to a park behind their house, and since space is at an ultra premium, you will simply ignore parks. Simply put, Sim City looks nice, sounds nice, and has so much promise, but is crippled by a long series of terrible design choices that ultimately reduce Sim City (2013) to a boring mess.

I expect a game not to blow up in my face after 30 hours of progress. Forget being online or offline for a moment, to have your efforts wiped clean because of a server sync issue and no backup save is extremely amateur. The \"Unable to load city. Please try again.\" error that corrupts your whole region, or one city if you are lucky, has not been acknowledged or fixed. One would argue that region functionality is core to the designers vision, that is definitely true. But it\u0027s created a frustrating, unstable gaming experience for which a free game is hardly compensation. They need to rethink their refund policy particularly for those who pre-ordered, as I did, and expected a working game regardless of how it synchronized or required online play. I really want to rate this game what it deserves, but even something as basic as saving your progress isn\u0027t completely functional and it\u0027s deserving of the lowest rating possible. My bank is reversing the charge with one final step in the investigation. If there is a litany of bug fixes and arse kissing, there might be hope of buying it in the coming months.… ",

Whether you like it or not, it will be the future of gaming. I completely agree that Maxi\u0027s and EA didn\u0027t learn from Diablo 3, where their launch was very bad. However, you can\u0027t just be angry because of one mistake. I think the haters are a little too overboard, this game worth at least a 6/10. If everyone judges a game by its release, then you really need to realize how pre-mature your comments are coming out. Many problems in SimCity right now are fixable. There\u0027s a lot of potential in this game, and I look forward to have more of this game. (I don\u0027t work or got paid by EA to say all this) This game is worth to check it out. 59.99 seems a little too much for this game through.

However, for us die-hard SimCity fans, this game falls very short of our expectations, namely for just a few yet devastatingly consequential reasons: No terraforming. Nearly half of the pleasure of the old SimCity was creating a landscape that was entirely a product of your own work and settling the human population where you wished and where the terrain best fitted such development. The satisfaction of \"owning your work\" and producing an entirely customized terrain that boasts and entirely customized network of human development is indescribable. The loss of this option in the new SimCity is thus also indescribable. Tiny city boundaries. In a game where I would be deeply involved in playing a region for months and sometimes years concocting sprawling metropolises, industrial suburbs, bedroom residential communities, satellite cities, extensive interconnected mass transportation networks... I have grown agonizingly frustrated with the fact that my cities are unrealistically constrained by tiny square borders. In fact, the city limits are built-out so quickly that I\u0027ve already grown bored with the game only after a few days of playing it. No possibility for expansion or realistic regional connections equates to no more motivation for me to play the game. City boundaries do not touch each other. Similar to my last point, I cannot \"continue\" one city into an adjacent one to create a realistic and expansively developed metropolitan area. Instead I am restrained to making rather isolated communities connected by \"exits\" on a transportation network that is reminiscent of how post-World War II sprawling suburban communities are connected. Zoning is regulated by roads. If I want a higher-capacity road in a rural area and simply wish to have some light development along it, I\u0027m out of luck. Mid- and high-rise buildings will unrealistically rise out of what was intended to be a sparsely populated landscape. In real life, zoning is not delegated by road capacity. In fact, there are numerous examples of high density developments on tiny roads. Restricted vehicular mobility in such areas are compensated by extensive mass transportation networks. The game is highly-geared to the road, which in my opinion, is a big step backwards. If I want to zone high density on a small street, please let me do it. My sims will either suffer the consequences or I will figure out a way to make it work through other transit options. In any case, give me the freedom to make that decision. Truth be told, the highly controversial move to entirely-online game play does not bother me one bit. In fact, it\u0027s great because I don\u0027t have to save extensively large files associated with SimCity on my computer anymore. If I wanted to, I could invite friends to make cities in a region with me and we could cooperatively build a metropolitan area together. That is such a great idea and deserves much applause. This does, in fact, push the game into the 21st century. Unfortunately, though, despite the wonderful aspects of the new SimCity, the four major downfalls mentioned above, in my opinion, have taken the game back into the 20th century. For \"self-proclaimed\" veterans and die-hard fans like myself, there are several major disappointments to the new SimCity that degrade the game to the level of undesirable. Having been playing SimCity since I was a small child, I\u0027ve watched as the game has made leaps and bounds toward more creative, customizable, expansive, and realistic game play. But as I play the new SimCity, it pains me to say that I\u0027ve been taken backwards. My hands literally feel like they\u0027re tied, in so many ways. I really do hope that the keys to these handcuffs associated with the new SimCity\u0027s game play are not thrown away forever. I strongly urge you to incorporate elements from the previous SimCity (as indicated above in the points above) into the new SimCity and perhaps come out with a serious of patches, updates, or whatever is needed to bring the real SimCity back to life. The innovate and highly appealing elements are there, but some of the most basic, realistic, and quite frankly expected, aspects of the game need to be reincorporated.… ",

Since you have to upgrade your town hall to city hall which needs a lot of residents then add a department of transportation to ship or gain workers and a trade depot to trade resources WITH ONLY $50,000 which I find ridiculous! It forces you to play with others or claim other lands which shouldn\u0027t make me do that and the land size is so small that I can barely call this game simCITY... hey I\u0027m not talking about a metropolis here but the amount of space you get is a one block in the map.

I have played SimCity games in the past and they didn\u0027t hold my interest nearly as well SimCity 2000 was great, but SimCity is greater! ...except for this one little problem I\u0027ve been having. You see, one of my first cities reached 190,000 populace and then I was booted from it and asked to roll it back or abandon it. I chose to roll it back. Instead, I ended up with 0 populace, 0 money. It was a painful loss but it happens, so I charged on! Another 190,000 city came and then thanks to some bad austerity-related decisions made by my co-Mayor, we ended up losing 80,000 populace and $1 million (thanks bonds and windfarm!), but we dredged our way back up to 200,000 and then... roll back or abandon. Now, two weeks later, countless cities have had this problem. You know, I\u0027m fairly easy to please with games, if they\u0027re fun and addictive, cool, cool. A few bugs? I\u0027ll stick it out. But you know, I at least expect a gaming company to have the common courtesy to release a game that is playable. SimCity almost made it. Almost. I never had the server issues common to others, everything ran absurdly smoothly from day one... except this. And it\u0027s not just 190,000 populace cities, my most recent loss was yesterday and it was a city of 50,000 that was doing way better monetarily and had way better social services than the prior ones, with delicate tax control that encouraged rapid population growth. With the population booming from 30,000 to over 50,000 in a matter of minutes, the error occurred. It\u0027s not just me, either. On the official EA forum, there is a 9-page thread on unlucky people like me who have experienced this repeatedly from day one. EA needs to get their act together and fix this mess. If they had put a little bit more quality control into this game, it could have been easily in 2013\u0027s top 5. Instead, it remains thus far at the bottom. For shame, EA, for shame.… ",

This game is incomplete. EA is selling a fraction of a game for full retail price. This game could have been epic but EA has exploited and destroyed yet another legacy from what used to be a consumer driven industry. EA states that releasing a version of this game consistent with its legacy does not fit their \"vision\" for the new SimCity... I state that paying $60 for a fraction of a game experience then purchasing the rest of what should have been part of the initial game in the form of DLC over a period of time does fit with my vision of what I want and expect from a SimCity game.

The game itself however, once you finally manage to log in, plays pretty fun for a couple of hours. The cities are rather small so you have to expand inside your region to create new cities that can provide each other with different services. This makes a huge part of the so called multiplayer experience, since you can either choose to build up several cities in one region all by yourself or let your friends build some in your region. A good idea actually but server instabilities, slow response times (e.g. it takes AGES to send someone inside your region a gift. Hell it even takes ages to do so while playing all on your own with different cities inside YOUR region). After a couple of mostly pretty entertaining hours however the game starts to behave \"strange\". A city with a HUGE load of residents and nearly no industry whatsoever suddently starts complaining about not enough workers?! At first you might start to compensate by building \"support cities\" that provide more workforce for your main city but this doesn\u0027t help at all. The reason is that the actual resident size is more or less a hoax. Doing the math (google it, I really don\u0027t want to go into detail here), a city of 100000 residents might just have 10000 real ones, logicaly not providing enough workers for the industry. The flaws of SimCity really make it hard to enjoy after a while and although it could be a very very good game, it isn\u0027t. Sadly.… ",

But every now and then something would crop up and cause a confused face; the first one was the small plot of land, I shrugged it off and thought the mechanics must be different. The second confusion showed its face when I first hit the 100,000 mark, at that point I noticed the city I had built had become so squished with tall buildings that it no longer resembled a typical city, to make matters worse, I could not build all the structures I would have liked to, this led me to understand that the game does not want me to play alone, it wants me to either play other plots of land in the same region and specialize them to support each other, or wait for online players to join in. The frustration was starting to set in heavy at that point. 1. I do not like loading and reloading all these different cities that don\u0027t even look like cities just to support the one city you care about. 2. When I attempted to start a multiplayer game, no body joined. So with a final attempt at giving the game a chance, I looked for existing maps to join, but very few were active longer than 3 days and those that were, are full; so no hope there either. Maxis, if you read this, you have a valuable game sitting here, this is only going to be successful for you right now: release the modding tools, but if you won\u0027t do that, at least focus the game for single player, doubling the plot size would be a welcome start.

However, this SimCity is a much simplified game than the previous: Agriculture is gone, density control is gone, policy/legislation is gone... While one would expect that the new game gives more options in city building, it just doesn\u0027t. For example, you may think of using subway system or even cycle tracks to solve traffic jam, like in many real world cities during the last ten years. None of these are allowed, you can either upgrade your roads or build more roads. The basic system is population oriented, you need to boost the city and regional population to unlock higher tier infrastructure, which is nonsense (Before you have enough population to upgrade your city hall, you are not even allowed to do waste recycling in your city, ridiculous) The \"city specialty\" feel so mining focused, that you wonder whether it is sponsored by real world mining companies. You can build a oil well in an urban area and it is cleaner than one would imagine. The game may be fun for those who just want to see buildings pop up and vehicles running around the city; but if you are those \"thinkers\" type that look for a planning challenge and build a dream city your way, I am sure that you will be disappointed.

The contamination stays quite a while and the chance of another meteorite impact is higher than having your city cured. As a closing remark a list of major game bugs and graphical issues I found on the web: Major game bugs: Not enough rain to refill water supply. - AI always takes the shortest route, never the fastest or best. - Recycling Centers can stop working, and once they do, they never start processing incoming materials again, and the collection trucks stop running. - Power/waste/water does not trade properly with region neighbors. City A can have huge excess for sale but city B may only be buying 10% of the excess and be short on power/waste/water. Ambulances are not being dispatched. You can look at the Health data map and don\u0027t see any ambulances. - No Railroad Discovery Delta has a city with no railroad connection but a railroad that stops at a bridge (the Island City) City to city trades (gift) are late, slow or not occurring at all. Frieght not being bought properly by region neighbors. Excess can be in city A and city B is not accepting it. - Excess workers not being employed properly by region neighbors. Excess workers can be in city A and city B is not employing them. AI services (fire, ambulances, recycle, garbo, police) don\u0027t get to region neighbors properly. Excess sik can be in city A and city B has ambo\u0027s doing nothing yet not getting them to hospital. May be related to traffic issues. - Regional roads causing MASSIVE congestion. Need ability to add regional roads. AI services (fire, ambulances, recycle, garbage, police) don\u0027t \"cheat\" around traffic and get around them. - Cars driving in circles with no reason. - Service cars (police, fire, dump, etc.) distribution seems off, they often drive in a pack which decreases the overall range. - Accidents aren\u0027t handled properly by emergency services. Great works do not update resource count until all players in the region exit. Additions to Great Hall do not translate over to the entire region. Build a department of transportation, but neighbors couldn\u0027t build train stations. Same with dept. of education as well. Sims not using mass transit well, filling streets, adding to traffic AI problems. Tourism fluctuation from 30,000 to 1000 for seemingly no reason. Some buildings not affecting entire region. Trade/Metals/Petroleum HQ upgrades don\u0027t all work. Sometimes roads can become completely broken and traffic gets indefinitely stuck on them. You need to delete the road to get the flow moving again. Agents get stuck when deleting or downgrading road. Also when deleting building where agents are out in the region. - Despite having multiple schools/colleges/universities, your people will become uneducated for no reason. - Water and power will sometimes break down and stop delivering correctly to all buildings. You need to remove roads and/or close buildings to fix the flow. - You can\u0027t buy 100% of water ajouter city CAN sell to you (if you need 110L and a city can sell you 150L, you\u0027ll only buy 100L) Educated sims won\u0027t commute and create medium/high tech industries in other cities. Amount of free classroom spaces in region view is sometimes not calculated. In some case, the amount of non unrolled students is not updated and is equal to total of students in the city which makes the number of school place not good. Cars can get stuck at the exit of a building a lock the street until you leave the city and reload it When a delivery truck cannot unload its delivery to a factory (i.e. multiple trucks were dispatched but the factory only needed one truckload), the trucks return to their home depots/ports and any undeliverable resources disappear instead of being transferred back into the depot/port. Graphical Issues: - The roads disappear at certain zoom levels. - Roads underwater. - Buildings on avenues. - Ploppables not graphically connecting to roads properly (e.g.: Tram depot). - Buildings on top of other buildings.… ",

If your school doesn\u0027t have enough space for al the pupils you simply build a new extension and improve the capacity of this school. Awesome! It\u0027s right, these two points are the single positive aspects of the new Sim City. My fan-heart is bleeding when I think about the possibilities of a real Sim City 5, based on SC4 with an advanced region part. - Small Maps: Okay, the maps are not small they\u0027re tiny absurd puny! - Curvy roads: This should be a Pro, but according to the point above, it\u0027s a absolut senseless feature. - Bugs: The \"new\" Glassbox-Engine, which simulate the whole behavior of the sims/residents, commercial interactions and so on, is so buggy atm that I\u0027m not able to numerate half of the varios bugs and errors. The traffic bug is only the tip of the iceberg. - Multiplayer: Had anyone ever thought \"Hey it would be cool to play together with a friend of me now.\" during playing Sim City 4? I never, but multiplayer sounds funny in the first presentations. But Sim City has no \"real\" multiplayer: Everything you could do with other players together, you\u0027re able to do it solo. There is absolut no real reason for the existence of the multiplayer modus in the actual design. - Always-On: I\u0027m not a fan of DRM but I understand the reasons to make some games always-on. To example Diablo 3 to prefent dupes and to secure the auction house. But in Sim City there is no gameplay reason to be always online. And the so-called social features: This is only a game! If I want to contact my friends I grap my phone or start my IM. I don\u0027t need these functionality in a single-player game!… ",

Instead, it not only isn\u0027t better than Cities XL, in many ways it\u0027s worse than SimCity 4! The city size is way too small. That means that after max 8 hours you need to abandon your city, because there\u0027s noting left to do in it except for watching traffic jams. That also means that you won\u0027t be able to ever build 50% of the buildings, because they take up so much space! Also the AI is completely broken. This causes huge traffic jams. You need 3x more trams, busses, police cars and garbage trucks, because instead of spreading, they all follow the same route! It\u0027s so bad that busses, instead of reducing traffic, are causing it! There\u0027s also no terraforming, no highways, not metro. The graphics are quite good, but too childish and sims-ish for me. Music is also good, but not as good as in SC4. It\u0027s a nice game with good music and sound effects, and quite nice graphics. Unfortunately it\u0027s also quite broken and is twice the money of Cities XL. Also the performance isn\u0027t great and there are some graphics options that are clearly broken and cause huge fps drops even on a high end pc.… ",

Depending on how much you are a fan of the series, you will probably, like me, get 20 hours of super fun on this game (for myself 27 with the beta). The problem here is that after that 20 hours, the game will start being boring, even when you take your time. The biggest reason for this is the repetitiveness of the cities. They really will look similar. A 6/10 seems like a justifiable result for this game. Simcity 4 is definitely better but this game is fresh anyway. and thanks Maxis for the free game.… ",

Of course, within the allotted beta time there wasn\u0027t a great ability to build a very large city that would have traffic problems. The game seamed great in beta but now that the full game is out, my entire opinion of this game has changed. Below are some areas of the game that I have a problem with. 1. Traffic This is the biggest problem because it translates into many more problems, such as fires not being extinguished and criminals not being arrested. It also negatively effects tourist attractions and trade, garbage collection and other issues. Try plopping an airport and watch the masses of taxis pile up on your roads. Adding mass transit only seems to worsen the traffic problem and while the recent game update did help lighten traffic some, it wasn\u0027t enough to thoroughly enjoy the game more. Previous versions of SimCity offered one way streets, subway travel and the ability to connect cities with each other via highway and other methods. Can you think of many real cities that only has one road connecting it to the outside world? The game needs a complete do-over when it comes to transportation and regional connectivity. 2. City Size When it comes to the size of the city I would much rather be playing CityVille (a free Facebook game) which allows you to expand your city boundaries as you meet certain achievements. I spent $79 on my copy of SimCity (as did many of you) and I most certainly do not appreciate the relatively small city boundaries that are present in this game. Plop a municipal airport and expand a few wind or solar farms and then see how much space you have left. 3. Others There are numerous bugs throughout the game and the only real way to bring it to Maxis\u0027s attention is to post in a forum, I\u0027m not a big fan of forums, the game needs a built in form to submit bugs. The game doesn\u0027t have enough depth to it to keep me entertained for long, to be honest, if it weren\u0027t for the traffic problems I probably would have already got bored with it and quit anyways. For example, what is the most used utility besides electric and water (maybe even as much as those)? Cell phones! It looks like this neighborhood could use a cell tower! It looks like the city needs to contract with a cable provider. Simple additions like this would continue to make the game more entertaining. What happened to the ordinances? These little city laws that you could activate in SC4 made a world of difference on traffic, pollution, education, health and many other aspects of the game. Server issues appear to be a thing of the past and that\u0027s great but now it\u0027s time to focus on the overall game. I didn\u0027t want my review and thoughts of the game to be based on server issues so with those aside, I give the game a 5/10 rating. Since the game is fully a connected experience (which I\u0027m perfectly okay with) I hope to see many improvements made but I think I\u0027ll wait awhile before I hop on the game again.… ",

There are still some problems that need addressing including contradictory information in game and instances where the server is not syncing with the cities, so you end up having to roll back to a previous state essentially losing all your recent progress. But apart from that its a really good game that is incredibly fun to play. It would be nice to have an offline mode but I have found the multilayer aspect extremely rewarding as I share my region with a couple of my buddies. It\u0027s great building different types of cities and either sabotaging your citizens lives or building lots of parks and keeping them happy. Of course its seriously entertaining when you get a zombie outbreak and you can watch them annihilate your population. One real problem with the game play itself is how small the cities are. It\u0027s great building multiple cities that work together, but It can be frustrating running out of space especially when nearly all of your buildings are already high density. Its a shame considering how you could make enormous cities in Simcity 4. This is something that should be amended because it really does put a limit on how long you can play the game for. It gets to a point that all you can do is leave your old city and start a new one.… ",

The result of such idiotic method is that whenever the sever the game connected to becomes unstable or overload, (which it had happen within hours of the lunch of the game,) you will be completely locked out from playing the game. Maxis has claim that DRM is needed because that every single Sims in the game has its individual goal and movement, and as a result, it needs not only your computer but also cloud sever to share the processing power. Now as we all know that reason is completely rubbish. What EA and Maxis did is they wanted to protect its game from being hack, at all cost, at player\u0027s cost. And within few weeks of the release of the game, the game got hacked regardless of such self-fish measure. So what does all it mean? Well, in short, it means that when you buy this game, which I stupidly did, you bought a game that suppose to be SP but can\u0027t really because you need to go online to play it even if you just want to play it alone. it means you have to rely that Maxis or EA to keep those sever go on as time goes by. And that means if EA wants to cheap out( which they always do) they might shut off the sever and you end up paying 90 bucks for a game that might only last few years. In a more detail, the city size is limited, in your map, you are force to choose the reset areas, which is unheard of for a sandbox creative game. And on top of that, the boarder between city is idiotic, simply because it left so much space you can see but you couldn\u0027t use. Transport system is totally junk, All bus go into the same direction, same as street cart. On top of that, you only have few choice for transportation system, unlike in simcity 4. No highway, you only have one exit point toward the rest of the region because every map is reset. No highway. You can\u0027t really play SP on this game because if you don\u0027t have another player playing within the region, you can\u0027t do trades. You can have two city building at the same time in the same region, but they don\u0027t update, so you can\u0027t send support between two city. So basically they turn a suppose primary SP game into a MP game. For 90 bucks to buy a broken game, I think I am very kind to give it a 0. If I have a choice, I would give it a minus 10… ",

I downloaded the game this weekend, hoping the server startup issues had passed. I spent 24 hours with it this weekend, so I have a pretty good feel for it. I will list the major problems I feel are still there at this time. (1) The first thing that hit me was the horrible user interface to select a server. Selecting a server (East 1, etc., is not based on any actual information). Once in the game menu, it is very difficult to find a game. (2) The second and most major issue I have is that I couldn\u0027t get a multiplayer game to work. I am not sure if they disconnected the multiplayer functionality, but I was not able to find any active games to join, despite trying for quite a while. (Sorry, I don\u0027t have friends who were up for a weekend of SimCity, and I certainly wouldn\u0027t recommend that anyone else purchase the game.) (3) So, I just played solo and built multiple cities, switching back and forth which is my next issue with the game, also not a significant. The regional interactions are not very smooth, which I would say is my next issue with the game. This is necessary b/c the maps are to small to have a complete city in one. I think having smaller, specialized cities could be fun, (e.g. one city has as powerplant, the next city has sewer/water, mining, oil, etc.) except the interactions are messy and quite frankly don\u0027t seem to work. i.e. I have one city with ample sewage treatement for 4 cities and it doesn\u0027t work for the neighboring 2 cities. I was unclear if any of the statistics or trade options are accurate or beneficial. (4) A MAJOR problem: the in-game crashes. In 24 hrs of play I had about a 15 lock ups, error messages, and even a couple \"blue screens.\" Most of these issues resulted in loss of my progress. I have a pretty nice desktop, and I have not had issues with any other games. (5) There are a lot of little bugs and annoyences within the game. It is hard to figure out how to plot things out, as just a fraction of a box can cause you to redo expensive building. The budget doesn\u0027t account for the trade income, for some reason, making it very unpredictable to budget. Some of the improvements that are costly (e.g. trade buildings) seem to not help at all. I would say the graphics are the best of any SimCity game and are pretty impressive. If nothing else, the engine has promise to create a good game in the future. None of the previous SimCities were perfect, but this one has way too many bugs. YOU MAY HEAR PEOPLE SUGGESTING THE PROBLEMES WILL BE PATCHED, BUT I DOUBT IT. If there was a good solution for the server issues I think they would have found it by now. As far as the user interface and in-game issues, it seems like most of the issues would take tons of man hours troubleshooting and rewriting the code. I would not recommend buying it unless you really want to see for yourself. I would at least wait until the price drops to less than $30.… ",

Fans of the prior series might discover the entire base upon which the simulation is created suffers from design issues. Entire cities can be created without the need of anything but residential areas and the most basic of needs covered. While most of us wouldn\u0027t find enjoyment in merely planting residences and let time go, this shows a game broken in the very core. The fact the simulation design allows people to move in, be happy and improve their houses in cities with no jobs and no shopping ripples throughout the game experience. The areas of which you can build your cities is pre-made and compared to earlier SimCitys the area is very limited in size. This is a part of the multiplayer aspect Maxis invisioned. The option for a multiplayer in a SimCity game is in this reader\u0027s eyes a great evolution, if not for a few things: The multiplayer part is not really an \u0027option\u0027. To get the maximum efficiency from your city, it needs to co-operate with other cities. Sure enough you can build multiple cities yourself, but as each is paused when you leave it, there\u0027ll never be a feel of a real flow between the cities. Another issue is the interaction between the cities is unimaginary, limited in such ways you can\u0027t even decide how much, if or at which price you want to sell the goods you got in excess. It happens at a preset price as soon as someone clicks \"buy\" in regional view. This is if it even works through the seemingly limitless amounts of bugs with inter-city relations. Perhaps the worst part about the multiplayer \u0027option\u0027 is the way it was used as an excuse of forcing you to be constantly logged in to their game servers. Not only does this force you to be connected to the internet constantly, which most of us are anyways, but it forces us to rely on servers being available. \u0027A small server crash is not an issue, go do something else\u0027 you might say, and yes, I can do that now, but what happens in a number of year\u0027s time when SimCity isn\u0027t worth keeping around any more? If servers then get shut down, we\u0027re left with a product we can\u0027t even use any more. When through with all these issues and bugs you\u0027re left with a beautyful game and at times a good amount of humor. Who here wouldn\u0027t love to shop at \"Lead Paint and Baby Oil\" for instance? There seems to be a little Maxis soul left in there in the details, but overall the game feels rushed, the old fans forgotten and most of all give you the sense of being \u0027victim\u0027 to a quick moneygrab based on old feelings toward the brand. For experienced and long term SimCity players, the issues in the basic design will most likely come as a huge problem, same would most likely go for the restricted space offered. Personally I wouldn\u0027t advice anyone to buy the game till it\u0027s on sale at half off, the quality of the game is simply closer to a $30 game, if even that. The most frustrating thing is that I\u0027m not only giving SimCity a low score, I am giving the future of the brand the same low score. Based on a broken design, a bugged game, visions that might\u0027ve been good but where the execution failed and a raped brand, which only redeeming qualities are the humor and the beautyful graphics I\u0027ll give it a 4.

Although, I do like the idea of having actual people in a region making cities and trading with other players, it\u0027s a very interesting part of it, but playing with friends seems to be troublesome as you all have to be on the same servers, and finding an open game just to join is also a chore....but always online drm isn\u0027t needed for that. The game is fun, but it does have its problems. Traffic seems to be a constant problem, how they handle ground water seems to be unrealistic, and some other general oddness. It does seem though they really wanted people to make specialized cities as opposed to the mish-mosh of RCI that we\u0027d normally see. You can still do the traditional cities, but the specializations do make it interesting and are really how to get those high tech buildings people want. Visually the game is nice, and being able to zoom to street level and see sims and thoughts is cool. There are texture problems here and there with building flickering in and out of existance. Play areas are fairly small compared to the old titles, but you will run into the same issues regardless of map size (overcrowding, homeless, etc), and in some ways makes the player focus more on making the areas more desirable. you can however make multiple cities in a region and have them work with each other. So I guess being mayor of 3 or 4 small cities is like being the mayor of a big one. The game is not terrible, although probably had one of the worse releases I have seen in 20+ years of playing video games. It does have its issues, and falling retail prices reflect that. So, if you can get the game on sale at Target, go for it.… ",

My city with 4 fire halls managed to have a whole block burn down because all 6 of my firetrucks were doing a Congo line clogged up responding to the SAME fire on the other end of the city. Why does the game send all my firetrucks to the same fire? I don\u0027t know. This is the same for all emergency services. The citizens going to work all behave the same way too! They wake up in the morning, and head to the CLOSEST workplace to them! Not the one they\u0027ve worked the day before, but just the closest. If one work place is closer to your residential area than the rest of all your workplaces, then that place is going to have a massive traffic jam every morning. Same thing applies for the evening commute. Online reviews can claim that you just have to plan and build your city with those AI restrictions in mind, and I ask them, why do I have to build a city that only functions properly given some weird AI programming made by a supposed city simulation game?

You can experience that your ambulances drive in circles instead of ever getting to patients or the hospital, whichever is the case. All of your fire trucks may respond to the same fire at the same time, even if there are multiple fires. Police cars respond poorly too. And all of them stop on red lights. Furthermore the economics must have been made by a republican and a tea party member with a libertarian boss who all decided that hey, expensive public services are cool, but no-one should pay a dime for it. By which I mean the tax system is nonsensical. The taxation is normally flat, unless you build a special attachment to your city hall, but raise taxes above 9 or 10% and the people go bananas. The price of public services you MUST have though is so high you can\u0027t easily manage to provide the services the public demands. Mind you these are just a few of many issues. I cannot possibly cover them all in this review. Therefore, in conclusion: Avoid this game. It is not worth it.

I personally feel that when it comes to the game play aspects of this game in one city, they were almost perfect. I love building a city and watching it grow. They simplified the way water and electricity works, you no longer requires power lines or pipes. Building and maintaining your economy is easy and long as you don\u0027t do anything stupid. It\u0027s just overall a lot of fun. In my book these aspects of the game deserve an 8.5/10. Now we\u0027ll talk about the negative things. DRM is never the solution to any single player game, ever. All the arguments that it \"stops piracy\" or \"enhances your game play experience\" are total bull shiest. DRM is limiting the people that pay for your game and only slows down those who would steal it. Take a look at Diablo 3, there are more than 10 torrents online that include server emulators. It doesn\u0027t stop piracy, it only slows it down. I also can\u0027t stand how small the area is that they give you to build your city\u0027s. City\u0027s in SC4 or SC3000 could be up to 15 times bigger. The excuse that \"it won\u0027t run on dad\u0027s computer\" is also bull shiest. I don\u0027t have \"dad\u0027s computer\" I have my computer that I spent a good amount of money on so that I could run things like that, stop limiting the people with the better machines to what the people with the lowest machines can handle. These aspects deserve a 2/10. Also, anyone who re-reviews this game after giving it a negative one at launch shouldn\u0027t. Don\u0027t excuse the current game for the failings at launch. I didn\u0027t have the game at launch, but if I pay $60 for anything, I expect it to work whenever I want to use it. So overall I think the game is a 7. All the right ideas are there when it comes to game play, but they are severely hindered by the Always on DRM.… ",

Unfortunately, due to EA\u0027s reputation, the always on DRM and several other aspects, a very polished, fun, worthy titles is getting a massive amount of bad feedback from immature children who cannot understand that things can and will change with time.

I closed the game I thought that the problem will be solved when I restart the game, but it didn\u0027t because I couldn\u0027t save my game. Graphics are very bad, it really looks like Sims 3 or a cartoon. I can say that I spent 120 Turkish Lira ($67-70) for nothing.… ",

One user here said it was a 80£ Facebook game, which is pretty much the most accurate description of the latest Sim City I have seen. I am not an EA hater (please disregard my nickname). I don\u0027t even mind Origin, or the insanely annoying always-on DRM system. Hell, I can even accept overpriced digital downloads if they\u0027re for a decent game such as Mass Effect or Star Wars: The Old Republic. I\u0027m a grown man, I can afford a fiver here and a fiver there. The number one problem with this game is that is completely, utterly dull. Replayability: Zero. I had been looking forward to this game since it was announced, but started to worry when I was bored in the beta even before the mind numbingly stupid one-hour time limit was up. When the game was released, my worst fears came true. Nevermind the fact that I couldn\u0027t play for two days because EA didn\u0027t want to spend money on server capacity. Maxis, hopefully bullied around by the suits in EA, had utterly ruined one of my favorite franchise. The list of reasons why this game completely fails to live up to its predecessor is long. Very long. Here are a few game-breakers. - City size. You -will- use all the available land within an hour or three. After that, it\u0027s all about understanding how the game\u0027s traffic system works. Or doesn\u0027t, depending on how you see it. - Traffic. As mentioned, it is horrible. The agent system in Sandbox (Sim City\u0027s engine) simply does not work for traffic. Emergency vehicles get stuck in traffic, city services (garbage trucks, school buses etc.). Google \"Sim City traffic\" and you will see just how realistic looking cities that \"work\" in this game are. - AI is non existent. The PR people at EA bragged much about how each sim would have his or her own job, personality, home etc. That was a lie. Every morning, every sim goes out looking for a job, stopping at the first available job for his or her education level. It is impossible to feel attached to your citizens, because the only thing their zombielike behaviour does is messing up traffic even more. - Multiplayer is worthless, there is very little (if any) cooperation and interaction between cities in a region. - No terraforming. Your territory acts like a plot from one of the Sims games. Just more static. - It is impossible to build a realistic city. All the reasons above contribute to that fact, and if you ever hoped you could simulate your home town like you did in Sim City 4 or one of the earlier games, forget it. This game won\u0027t do it. - City specialization is far from deep enough, and stops being interesting after a few hours. I\u0027m going to be generous and give this game a score of 2. I might have given it 3 points if it didn\u0027t break such an amazing franchise. The dumbed down graphics look nice, in a model landscape sort of way, which was supposedly what the devs were going for, and the game will keep you entertained for a few hours. Oh, and there\u0027s a color blind mode. If you see this game on a 10£ sale I have no doubt that we will see very soon) go for it, but don\u0027t believe for a second that the critic reviews aren\u0027t biased. This is a terrible, terrible game. Buy any of the Tropico games, Cities XL, Cities in Motion or any of the other city sims out there. They are much better. Sim City 4 is still the king.… ",

SimCity is about Simulating a City, although the graphics are nice the game uses nothing but smoke and mirrors initially to capture players into thinking there\u0027s \"a lot going on\" behind the scenes, when this is absolutely not the case. RCI has almost no usage in this version. Entire cities have been built using nothing but residential lots. The muti-player \"features\" advertised do not function. Players are losing hours of work when disconnects happen. This game was clearly rushed out the door, and by rushed I mean by months and months, not just a few bugs here and there. EA had bought the recipe for SimCity\u0027s success from Will Wright/Maxis and failed to even use it when producing this version. The only upside to this game are the graphics(which do glitch out as well from time to time) Even the music cuts in and out with building/layer sounds getting stuck in infinite loops. The EA forums are on fire with angry users who want refunds, fixes and updates on the situation. A month after launch, the game launcher \"Recent News\" post is dated March 8th. It seems EA is determined to further Alienate their fanbase. This game truly deserves a 1/10 1 for fancy dance graphics and a slick interface which even fooled me initially for a few hours.… ",

I wasn\u0027t excited about receiving SimCity, I bought it as something to do in those long, endless holidays, but that is always what it has been. I have briefly played other SimCity games, but not to a great extent or particularly recently. In reality, I was going in blind. Initially, the menus feel a bit clunky despite their beauty and this is a truth throughout. I was disappointed by the lack of choice of regions (eight in all from memory), and then even more so by the lack of space to develop a city. I guess it\u0027s a 50-50 as it encourages you to be efficient in your planning but in reality the most efficient design is rows and rows of city blocks which look ugly. The small cities really limit the ability of the designer player to build the city of their dreams and still achieve the same successes as was possible in older games. The actual game is executed well but not superbly. I like the \u0027modular\u0027 style buildings that you can spring up and all the individual animations of every building and every sim are mesmerising. The specialisation possible in this game is fairly well thought out and the city constraints mean that once you specialise, you don\u0027t really have room for a lot else. The depth of animation is spectacular and there are many layers which you have to consider in order to get your city running well. That said, there are numerous different approaches to doing that and there\u0027s always something you can tweak to work that little bit better, which is always very satisfying. Furthermore, despite the small cities, you can always go out and claim another in the same region and use it to bolster your main one, be that as a commuter hub or power station and they all interlink very well and that is something I feel a lot of players forget. I\u0027ll be brief with the problems. There are numerous graphical glitches when on certain zoom levels which shouldn\u0027t be, I don\u0027t feel there is a great selection of buildings to place yourself (there are verging on a million parks, but little else), and I don\u0027t feel the AI systems particularly controlling traffic flow are very intelligent. Coupled to this, the way in which your city develops when density starts increasing isn\u0027t always smart and I feel as though when starting with a cosy suburb with wavy roads, it starts to upgrade and you get this big, rectangular apartments all of the same size which in turn make half your roads obsolete. I think there are ways in which high density buildings can have small footprints and this should be explored. This game is good and well made, but there are problems here and there which can drive you away after a couple of hours. By all means buy it, but don\u0027t expect to be blown away.… ",

Sim City....is dead, or at least the franchise that many of us are used to is anyway. Gone are the expansive maps and the hours of offline play we used to have. Gone is the steep learning curve and satisfying feeling from The always online requirement, although called a \"development decision by Maxis\" certainly stinks of anti-piracy DRM. Maxis ensure there is no way to disable this but the problem being of course that sources within Maxis have denied that this is a requirement but a simple trigger within the code. I have seen people play this game with no water, no electricity, no jobs and high pollution and yet their plot of land has developed into a huge city of skyscrapers, this to me suggests it\u0027s less of a simulation than you may think which takes away from the reason people play the game. Sim City isn\u0027t without it\u0027s pro\u0027s, graphically it\u0027s aesthetically pleasing with the hustle and bustle of a city being animated fairly well, albeit traffic forming where it shouldn\u0027t. The city overlays are also a nice addition, showing the water, electricity and sewage in real time you can also look at the bars of happiness and likeliness to expand for each house. Aside from these pro\u0027s, the game seem\u0027s extremely poor, closer to Farmville than Sim City 4. If you\u0027re new to gaming, don\u0027t want a challenge and have an extremely stable internet connection then perhaps Sim City is for you, however if any of the above don\u0027t fit your criteria I\u0027d suggest staying way clear.… ",

This new game has many great features that fans like me have been waiting decades for. Curved roads, upgrade-able buildings, specialized industry, actual tourism. Under-road utilities removes the headache of power-lines and pipes. I have had an enjoyable time learning the system and playing. If you are a true SimCity fan you\u0027ll find plenty to enjoy here. That being said.... you will also be frustrated by some of the limitations. City size is a major draw back for me. I always feel boxed in and forced to \"go big or go home\" so to speak. No room for low density neighborhoods in advanced towns. The size also makes large scale mass-transit impossible, so no highways or subways, which I loved in SC4. Traffic bugs and simulation quirks are also present some areas of improvement but it looks like Maxis is working on updates. This is not a perfect game by any means. It is better in mechanics than anything since SC4. If you like city builders you should try it... maybe once the price comes down...… ",

I bought this game a week after it was officially released and so far I\u0027ve been disappointed. The first serious problem you come across once you launch the game is trying to find a map that has open slots. Not only is there no way to filter the maps with ones that have spots open, but they\u0027re listed from the oldest to newest! I had to click through through pages and pages of servers and I spent almost 20 minutes trying to find a map with open slots! Now, once you get to building your city things start to get interesting. The graphics are very good, but the tutorial is very limited on teaching you the major dynamics of the game such as zone densities, freight, etc. It plays out just like every other Sim City game, but it\u0027s remarkably much easier than Sim City 3000 \u0026 4000 to stay in a positive budget. Building your city is very fun and challenging if you have to build around terrain or natural resources, but you very quickly come to realize just how small the maps are. The maps are about half the size of what I remember from any Sim City game and it literally doesn\u0027t take that much time before you\u0027re trying to squeeze out every inch of space in your city. Eventually you do hit the point where you have no more space. Also, the game\u0027s density system is overly complex and you will eventually hit a bottleneck where your city can\u0027t get any bigger. Literally I would say 5-6 hours into my city I would run out of space, couldn\u0027t increase my population any further, and I was making so much money that my city had millions in the bank. Also, the game\u0027s AI is very bad with it comes to trash collection, buses, and just about everything else. TLDR; too easy, gets boring fast, crappy map browser, great graphics, crappy AI, and SMALL MAPS!!!… ",

I couldn\u0027t find a phone number anywhere and frankly have had enough lost time at this point to not care anymore. So $80 down the drain. Worse than being a game that is not fun, this one wastes days/weeks of your progress and will do so over and over and over again. Second point is that many of the game features, specifically leader boards, are not functional. Also many of the main game mechanics do not seem to perform properly. STAY AWAY!… ",

Honestly, I\u0027ve been through plenty of games that had issues on release date, but if you were to base your decision on how much fun the game is on a technical issue, you\u0027re stupid. Especially on a major title like this where you know making it right is a matter time. So, my first realization wasn\u0027t the technical stuff. Who cares. I set out on this game looking through 1 of 10 or 15 maps to start my city on. Let me tell you, when I was looking at those maps, the game didn\u0027t lead me to think \"build a city\", it was \"build a continent\". I got halfway through my continent when I started getting it. I\u0027m thinking build a whole city on one grid. And, \"wow, these are small grids.\" However, as I build my neighboring cities and my cities started interacting, it seemed natural to assume building \"complete\" cities on each grid was a critical error. That\u0027s when the grids stopped being small. One \"city\" would be (mainly) industrial, one residential, etc. If you look at the maps and study which cities are hooked together by road and rail. Those groups functioned more as a single unit with workers, police and fire working together. You can pick any map you want, and if you play the whole thing, and think of the entire continent being designed to function as your \"megalopolis,\" small is definitely not what will be going through your head. If you\u0027re thinking you can try to jam your old strategies into a single grid, your frustration will probably put you in the dumb bunch who rated this game so poorly. This game is vast, dynamic, and nicely programmed. It\u0027s fun, fulfilling, and takes way more strategy than before. I haven\u0027t even scraped the surface tourism and trading strategies. So much to think about. So why don\u0027t I give it a ten? It is without a doubt in my mind the best iteration of the series. There are some things like schools. Once you build a university, schools as far as I can tell are useless. As a matter of fact, it looked to me like the total number of students simple migrated to the remaining educational facilities when I destroyed one. In effect, \"lower than university\" structures like elementary schools lowered the overall educational level of my city because the \"total number of students\" would simply be divided according to the number of schools you built... not the type. So after my university was built, by destroying my \"lower than university\" schools all the students would just migrate to the university thus always maximizing the education level. There are some of these types of things that would cause me to thump the designers heads. The issues are small, but that makes the game not perfect. And that\u0027s what a ten is.… ",

I liked the idea of a neighbouring city being built by another player, but they should have adopted a similar region concept to their previous titles, the fact that they used this is asinine. EA games needs to pull their heads out of the ground and start listening to gamers about always online DRM. Plenty of other companies show healthy profits. Maximizing profits does not earn you my dollar, respect does. It sucks that this company has ruined so many great and legendary gaming franchises.

I did it once and thought cool, and after a few hours me and the 3 other players I was playing with had filled up most of the city blocks and were starting on a Great Work. Once that was finished then all we could really do was twiddle our thumbs. Traffic problems were horrendous but there was nothing we could do about that, there was only one road in and out of our cities. Sure we could start another region and do it all again but why? there\u0027s 8 maps to choose from, the level of variety is obscenely low. I guess I would like the multiplayer and perhaps just SimCity itself more if it actually kept many of the things that made the series so great to begin with. But instead this game forces many sacrifices of things for these new ideas which honestly detract a lot from those ideas. I constantly dream up the things I could do if my city borders were bigger or if I actually could build my own intercity transport routes but instead I\u0027m stuck with what has been decided for me. SimCity has turned itself into a board game rather than being the sandbox city builder we onced loved.… ",

BUT! Take my word for it, THE REVIEWS ON THIS SITE DO THIS GAME 0 JUSTICE! To start you gotta think, Compared to Simcity 4, this game has it\u0027s limitations(fixed to medium map size, no manual pipes electricity lines etc), but most of the things changed were altered to make the gameplay more streamlined, For example, the world may be smaller, BUT it\u0027s not that much smaller, and if you can\u0027t fit your city in the confides of the map, then your doing something wrong. They are smaller to streamline the \"Region\" Idea more and it does work! Exceptionally I may add, sadly there isn\u0027t much benefit to playing singleplayer like this, but a game like this is meant to be played online, The automatic Pipe routing and electrical wiring, is automatic to make the map look less clutters and make it easier for beginners( I had tons of issues with this system on S4, I prefer the way it is now) Finally, If you were disappointed with this game, You were expecting too much, the Classic simcity gameplay is there, The Graphics are stunning, the tutorials are very well refined for beginners and all round is a better game than SimCity 4. I\u0027m aware the always online is a problem, but since they fixed the filter issue and I can play online now, This game just got better with online, This game is meant to be played online, so they Always online isn\u0027t a problem especially for me. This game deserves a much higher score than it receives, If you loved the simcity franchise, This game is for you. I\u0027m disgusted at people for rating this so low. This is a game everyone MUST own. It would get a 10 If Maxis iron out all the bugs.… ",

A gaming company (named the worst Company in America again) failed to live up to the demand of their customers, which is pretty much the #1 thing a company should concern itself with. In repeated interviews they were asked by the press if they would be ready for the sheer demand on their servers that an always online title would make and they constantly answered they would be. They of course failed and failed in epic fashion. Whereas Diablo 3 gave you \"Error 37\" and simply did not let you connect, on launch Simcity teased you by claiming that servers were full and giving you a timer. When said timer ran out it would again fail to connect and again start another timer, usually with an even longer wait. Once the launch issues were corrected it became apparent that the always online function was more of a handicap than it first appeared. You could no longer load a city whenever you wanted, you had to rely on the auto save function to recover your city should the unthinkable happen (such as getting disconnected from the server) and on top of that the cities were not shared across servers and many people had to server hop in the opening weeks of the game just to get connected so their hard work was made moot when the server they were using became full and they had to choose another. Top this off with what amounts to EA\u0027s Policy of Customer gouging and you have the makings of an utter failure. It is apparent that EA intends to make users pay for additional content piece meal, bit by bit as they see fit to release it, Things that should be free like cosmetic changes to building styles or vehicles are in the works as paid DLC. There will be no community modding as the game has an always online DRM (even though EA will claim it is not for DRM purposes, they will quickly ban anyone who attempts to circumvent it). The worst offense however is the games lack of completeness. It ran through a Beta build, but it still felt rushed. Numerous problems plague players such as traffic not behaving in a proper fashion, buildings not operating with the intended functions, and AI controlled services such as fire and police, acting erratically in response to situations they are supposed to deal with. Putting this all aside the game is a great revisit to the franchise, but its innovations are its shortcomings as well. The smaller city sizes coupled with the \"regional\" play handicaps most players. Anyone wishing to play a solo region must now manage multiple cities to ensure that they get all the services and functions required for just one city to work and the region view and city changing view are ridiculously complicated, requiring you to jump back to your own city every time before you can look at someone else\u0027s city, You can\u0027t just view one neighbor\u0027s city and then from that city jump to another neighbor, you have to go back to your own city and then jump to the other neighbor. The game just feels halfhearted and rushed.… ",

The game was hyped on the regional concept and multi player, however, more of that is broken than not. Regions will take overly long to synch, sometimes requiring a full shut down to do so. That doesn\u0027t mean all of the cities will show the same. Second the bugs within the trade system can seriously impact game play (double and triple billing of imports, lost exports) Great works, are problematic, and lack any real impact to the region. In the 16 city \"regions\" you are still only connected to 4 other cities at max, meaning your really not Massive and not multiplayer due to the synch issues. The roll back issue, fade to black issue and failing to process issues, are MASSIVE game breakers and those alone, should stop anyone from considering this since in most cases, its a lost city, and time. The agent pathing is so problematic with multiple areas of the game that it would be better suited to to remove it entirely from the game. Combine poor agent pathing, with important systems like water, power, mass transit and you have a game crippling DESIGN element. Over all, other than the graphics, the game is shallow, has issues with its base design that effect the game itself adversely to a point that one must question the thinking in using it at all. Never mind the still present server issues of rollback, loss of processing and the new fade to black.… ",

Lots of them. Too many to list. · Tiny Cities. My small interstate city is 9 times larger than the plots allowed in game, and our tallest building is the local courthouse. Skyscrapers in a city 1.2 miles square? Really? · One road connection to the rest of the region. One highway exit, connecting hundreds of thousands of people to areas outside of their little city. I\u0027ve seen traffic backups longer than my city is wide. Commuters stuck for simulated days. · Intercity trade and great works projects suffer extreme lag. Even when all the cities in a region are on one player\u0027s account. I could play SimCity 4 for days, and not get bored. I start falling asleep after 2-3 hours with this one. Instead of sticking with a formula that worked, Maxis and EA decided that limiting our creativity was the right way to go. Curved roads are practically useless on a map that small. Changes to your city are permanent, unless you physically unplug your modem. Many small bugs persist, despite updates. I would compare this game to a new car. A brand new car whose engine stutters, radio works intermittently, occasionally won\u0027t start, GPS attempts to run you in circles, and is boring to drive. And when you take it back to the dealer, they deny that they sold you a lemon, and try to sell you upgrades.… ",

Being the still proud owner of Sim City 4 that I am, I really looked forward to Sim City with the utmost enthusiasm. Was I ever disappointed. I will start with the thing that most have complained about. The Anti-Piracy measures that EA Games decided to attach to this game (Digital Rights Management). I understand that you need to put a stop to piracy but at the cost of your paying customer base? This was a bad move on behalf of EA and could have been handled so much better. Next is the size of the city which you can build. 2Km x 2Km. Most small towns I know of are bigger than this. It makes you feel extremely limited while also feeling that you could be doing so much more. I got the feeling that EA will be releasing paid for content which will increase the map size though. I gave this a 2 based on the quality of graphics, 0 was my first option. I found the graphics to be fairly pleasant to look at when you eventually prove that you didn\u0027t steal the game and are able to log in. The engine needs some work as it can be a little choppy but overall the visuals are good. To sum this up: I hope that EA have learned that there is a limit to what you can use as an anti-piracy measure before it becomes too much for the legitimate customer base to put up with. Presuming that people who downloaded the pirated version of previous games would have paid for a genuine copy is incorrect. Most of them probably wouldn\u0027t have so you can\u0027t call it a \"loss\" and then to implement measures which kill your developers game and reputation is just selfish and naive, especially of a large company like EA. Digital Rights Management (DRM) as an anti-piracy measure doesn\u0027t work. To top all this, a pirated version was released anyway.… ",

There could be much more content and interaction between players is limited. The intelligence of the sims could be brought to at least a kindergarten level and the playable area for a city could stand to be a little bigger. I hope Maxis can pull it out of the hat with an expansion but they are really slow on fixes and updates so I can\u0027t see it happening.… ",

Old timers will be immediately familiar with the various economic and social settings to monitor. Is your population fully employed? Are businesses making enough profit? Can your inhabitants move efficiently within the city? Are they educated? Can the police cope with crime? Le list is pretty long and hours go by quickly when taking on the stack of files. The AI is pretty solid despite recurring conflicts between the surface of residential zone (even with the of the map covered in green the game still says it\u0027s not enough), unemployment and consumer spending. This new Sim City introduces a micro-management system in which each administrative building can be customized with additional elements to boost its efficiency the police station can have more patrol cars, the bus terminal will have to receive more garages, the university can be extended with a business school or an engineer school, etc. This system provides you further leverage to reach prosperity, and keeps you even busier than before. But Maxis has more and offer you to choose a specialization to personalize your city. Gambling, Hi-Tech, Tourism, Oil, a nice array of possibilities that add further value. Let\u0027s stress that you can choose several of those in the same city feel free to erect the Tokyo Tower next to an exhibition center, while you pump oil not far from there! Those ones are no gimmick the warehouse exports, derricks provide barrels for your oil plant, the stadium welcomes tourists... The fourth layer of awesome is that your management actually has an impact on other Sim City players. The game is organized in regions of 4 to 16 cities which are communicating permanently. Goods will come from neighbours if your industry isn\u0027t doing enough, students form other cities will come if you have the best university, stations allow tourists to visit. Economic parameters are very detailed there are 3 levels of wealth, 3 levels of quality for merchandises and 3 levels of qualification for workers. If the middle class can\u0027t find goods of their liking at home, they\u0027ll be shopping elsewhere. If you\u0027re few to produce high-quality goods, the rich from everywhere will rush to buy. Positioning yourself within your region is a game in the game. Beyond this competitive side, cities can cooperate by sending ambulances, patrol cars or garbage trucks. Player can also sign contracts to provide electricity or water. That\u0027s where the whole systems finds its limits. Let\u0027s face it, you need every possible asset you have for your city, because there\u0027s never enough. Your neighbour isn\u0027t always monitoring his power supply, so you can being cut by mistake. To play cooperatively, players need to know each other beforehand. I lament that the laderboards and the world market are still to be implemented. The dev. team is still working to stabilize servers. A quick word on that apart from the launch day, I\u0027ve never had any problem to play. The standard size of the city is about one fourth of a small city in Sim City 3000. When I constructed my 2nd city (having drawn a map before), it took me... 3 hours. In Sim City, you must constantly invest to improve the standards of living. But you very quickly reach the point at which you can\u0027t have further residential surfaces, which means you cannot your population and your fiscal revenues. And if, like in my first city, you choose the seaside, you\u0027re fairly limited... the other issue lies in the expansions you can make to buildings it can necessitate far more surface than you expected at first. If you haven\u0027t made room in advance, you have to flatten entire blocks, lose inhabitants and revenues, which makes your budget worsen dramatically. The University fully developed is about the size of 6 residential blocks of high density! You need to make several cities to exhaust the game. I wish I had a big metropolis with everything in it, but sadly it\u0027s not an option. Sim City is an amazing game, so rich and complex that it seems infinite in theory. But in actual gameplay, it ends up being limited by a clear lack of polish. The dreams of ambitious managers may be crushed by the ridiculous size of the cities.… ",

It work beautifully, and takes some of the calculation load off your machine. 2)\u0027This version has less X!\u0027 The only items this version is lacking are subways, every other building and system has been immensely improved. Alot of the complaints here come from the Nostalgia effect where old things seem better, and simple hatred of EA: People WANT it to be bad so they can hate. 3)\u0027Omg 0nl1ne mult1player suxs!\u0027 No it doesn\u0027t. Its nice to have some friends to work with for once, and you all have internet connections. Its not a problem. Really. 4)This game is brilliant. Its easy to pick up and play. Its easier to get information about your city. It has the most advanced simulation of any city sim game ever made. And the ability to use micromanagement thanks to the new \u0027ploppable\u0027 item system really adds to the game. TL;DR: This games problems are GREATLY exaggerated. After playing I can only conclude that people either reviewed before the servers were fixed, are too deep into nostalgia to like anything knew, or hate EA so much they would dislike this game no matter what.… ",

My guess is about 75 hours of these are real gameplay times, due to the server issues upon launch. These have been fixed and I am not taking these into account scoring the game. Even though I consider building the city to be solid fun, there are too many bugs and design problems in this game for it to deserve a sufficient grade. An example; and keep in mind we are now at patch \"3.0\" and yet I still keep running into game-breaking bugs. After spending 5 hours designing your town to the best of your abilities and judging it is the appropriate time to educate your sims it is extremely frustrating to see your students being picked up by schoolbuses from neighbouring towns, never to be returned again. Another example; after giving up on educating your town and switching to tourism industry it is extremely frustrating to have 10.000 tourists enter your town by train, only to have them all leaving by taxi. Even though sim cities traffic issues have been mitigated somewhat, this still leads to a city breaking traffic jam. I could name several more examples I have personally encountered, but instead I would like to refer any interested buyers to the official simcity forums and its bug list; http://forum.ea.com/eaforum/posts/list/9469448.page Notice that the ratio of game breaking bugs to merely inconvenient bugs is about 1/3. My judgment could be summarized as; The gameplay has a lot of potential. However the amount of bugs and several suboptimal design choices have culminated in a product unworthy of anyones investment at this time. The game feels somewhat \"unfinished\" to me. A feeling backed by the amount of patches issued in the past two month.… ",

Further more, another terrible problem in my opinion is the city scale, the cities are way, way to small. It allows good players like myself to create an entire city, to the city borders in under 2 hours, which is terrible. Simcity fans want to spend countless hours on one city, without limits. The game is also a dumbed down version of the other Simcities, it is extremely easy. Overall this is a bad game. Recommendation: DO NOT BUY.… ",

For me, city simulators have always been about building immense megalopolis that fulfill my dreams AND are realistic, sometimes recreating real-life cities. This is completely impossible in this SimCity, because of the ridiculously small map size, the pre-made regions with fixed city placement (with empty landscape in between) and fixed intercity transport network, and the lack of realistic skyscrapers and such (you can\u0027t have realistically sized skyscrapers otherwise they would pretty much look oversized on the tiny map). I reckon that most players are not interested in creating realistic cities but they just want to have fun with the simulation. Well this game is really bad in that respect too. The agent-based simulation? Great idea, but all in all what I see (and interact with) in the game are the *effects* of the simulation, and it really doesn\u0027t matter if it\u0027s the single citizens who are simulated, or just the overall city data. Moreover, as everyone knows, the agent-based simulation has been really poorly implemented and it\u0027s still full of bugs after 2 months and many patches. Even if they completely fixed all the bugs and the sims\u0027 idiotic behaviour, the tiny map size would still hamper the depth of the simulation: you can have the most advanced transport pathfinding and traffic simulation in the world, but what does it matter if the longest road in your city is not even 1 mile long? The game still shows great promise but unless they *at least* fix all the bugs and add way larger map sizes, it will remain no more than a (very expensive) facebook game. And there is one last thing to consider. I have my simcity4 cities on a usb key. If I wanted I could reinstall the game and play with the cities I made 10 years ago. While I highly doubt simcity5 servers will still be online 10 years from now...… ",

The fact that there really is no proper connection to the RCI demand from teach category (e.g. the nonsense of having all residential cities) is just bad mechanics.

Linking the density to the rods is also poorly done, since you cannot choose to have roads that eliminate traffic, without also allowing more density, thus increasing traffic. You can\u0027t build a decent size city unless it is building consumer electronics because there is no way to generate enough money otherwise. This becomes a boring thing you have to do in one city in the region generating money, to have any chance of building up other cities for fun. Cities are absolutely too small. There is no way to create real city. You are making little towns that (sort of) interact, when tho online thing decides to work. Traffic is still out of control, even after a couple of patch attempts. Basic problem is that vehicles STILL don\u0027t make a decision based on the highest-capacity, lowest traffic route.

Online: A bit of a pain however I enjoy plenty of games with an always online requirement, my key gripes are; server fragmentation (you cant invite or join friends unless you are on the same server); Cities roll back sometimes costing you much time; cities corrupt still (as of 03/06/2013); and there is no support in place to manage these City Load issues. Game Objectives: SimCity is a playground, it is a bit small though and the simulation between Residential, Industrial and Commercial is a little nonsensical, however many a patch has come and gone an Maxis/EA are definitely on the right track. I\u0027d like to see more options without investing in specialization, or at least some changes to help tie the profits and losses from both City management and business management together. Creativity: SimCity has rules, which makes sense as it is a game after all, however with the tiny plot sizes and bugs/design decisions around how cities interact and support one another, you will never truly be able to create a Solo region as all cities must be played to supply resources such as power, water etc. due to asynchronous design. For those on the fence, I\u0027d say hold off and see what they do to address these issues, you may find they just throw content at the game and nothing really changes regarding the core issues, however if they change some mechanics and give players more options to create the City they want to build, it could be a late success story in terms of a quality.… ",

Citizens, resources and economies all interact with eachother across the borders, and the decision of one city influences the development of another in quite an intriguing manner. This really could have been a great game if it hadn\u0027t been for the fact that it\u0027s not. Not right now at least but with a couple of patches and an expansion or five it could be. At present there are so many issues that despite the new and interesting features and it\u0027s obvious potential overall gameplay suffers vastly. The 5000 characters permitted won\u0027t be sufficient for me to list the game\u0027s every shortcoming, so I\u0027ll just focus on the most essantial ones. First off, the area you\u0027re given is so small you can hardly fit a small town in it far less a metropolis. Nothing more to say about that really... if you like it cramped you\u0027ll marry this game and carry it\u0027s children no doubt. And these cramped buildspaces are particularly annoying seeing as how certain disasters (who seems to occur quite frequent) leave large portions of land uninhabitable for long (near infinite) periods of time. And to add to this misery of small build-areas, you can\u0027t even interact properly with the tiny patch of land you\u0027re given. Even the simplest of landscaping functions such as leveling/flattening the terrain in order to make more room for buildings has been removed and seeing as how the placement of buildings is dependent on the terrain the tiniest elevation can ruin any hope you have of properly planning the outlay of your city. How can you construct a city, if you\u0027re unable to interact with the terrain? Have you ever seen someone build a house without first adapting the ground? There are bulldozers in the game but appearantly these only work on removing buildings and rubbles of buildings. Even The Sims has terrain tools even in that game where you\u0027re only constructing houses they understand the value of this yet in SimCity where you\u0027re supposed to manage an entire city they\u0027ve chosen to remove this option entirely. And speaking of stupid... The regions you choose are all preset. You are unable to create new ones like you could in SimCity 4, and the ones you\u0027re stuck with gets dull real fast. Especially seeing as how you can\u0027t even influence which areas of the region are made available nor the landscape within in these areas. Why anyone would take away the ability for users to customize or create own regions is beyond me. Adding such features can keep a game fresh for years without any effort made on behalf of the developers at all and well-designed user-content is a potential source of income too. As of now you can\u0027t even kick an inactive player from your regions your influence on setting up your own game is actually *that* limited. So if the person controlling your neighboring city decides he doesn\u0027t want to play anymore, you\u0027re stuck with his deteriorating community forever. And seeing as how one city\u0027s development influences the next, this can effect your area quite profoundly. So... To conclude... All in all I enjoy this game. At first I didn\u0027t. I got hung up on it\u0027s issues and comparing it to SimCity 4 which I hold very dear and this blinded me of it\u0027s uniqueness and it\u0027s potential. But after having played it a couple of days it\u0027s actually grown on me. It delivers many new twists and concepts that can be challenging and rewarding in their own ways but this fascination won\u0027t last unless they add more interactivity to the concept and solve some of the major and deeply annoying gameplay and design issues. Because this game *does* have plenty of issues the ones mentioned here are far from all of them and if it is to reach it\u0027s full potential they have to be addressed. Otherwise it will end up in mediocrity, be one of many games you buy, play for a while and then uninstall for a long period of time before you one dull day decide to reinstall it again hoping it\u0027s not as limited as you remember it to be only to find yourself disappointed once more. I won\u0027t recommend anyone buying this game at present, if I could do it over I\u0027d most likely wait a couple of months when it\u0027s clearer in which direction it\u0027s headed but it\u0027s not so horrible I would warn against it either. I\u0027ve already had my money\u0027s worth of fun and it\u0027s only been a couple of days since I got it, and despite all the issues and the fact that it lacks much of what I enjoyed from previous games it also has a lot to build on. Let\u0027s just hope whoever decided to leave out landscaping tools is long gone when they do, and that the sensibility of the rest is larger than the maps they\u0027ve provided us with so far. Otherwise, this game is doomed.… ",

However I am going to compare this game to its predecessors with reference to its supposed \u0027cloud processing\u0027. - It was fun playing with a friend, this was not due to the supposed multiplayer, but it was fun because we could see each other\u0027s development and we strived to make a sustainable and still a good looking city. - Cities feel so so very small when we think about what the older simcities were like. My friend and I both agreed that cities should be bigger as it felt very crowded when we made high rises and large buildings and landmarks. - More maps and links. We see these maps are even more of an unnecessary restriction, why are we unable to connect every city and great work via road/railways, this would encourage us to play more in order to get every great work and create more cities since they are connected. - Ferries are so useless (imo) - I believe that they have attempted to (i forgot the word for it) re-make/re-publish this franchise a bit, however they should definitely remove the oh-so many restrictions this game has. Whether it be offline play, or large cities, or amount of cities on one map. I see simcity as a sandbox where I can create whatever I like and how many I want to make, and if you restrict me in this way, I really can\u0027t enjoy it to the fullest. While I do take into account that they may or may not be telling the truth that they require cloud processing and if restrictions were not placed then it might be too much, then they could spend more time seeing if they can utilise multi-core properly. - I feel that it was rushed and ruined by EA being their publisher. I feel for maxim. - Saying that, I have enjoyed the game for most of the 77+ hours (the is because origin booted me out and didn\u0027t save more of my hours) that I\u0027ve played - 7/10 for me. I still put more hours into this game than most, though I don\u0027t know if the enjoyment factor was as much.

A big issue is the game is too reliant on having an internet connection as maps are stored externally. My major problem with this game is that the size of the cities are too small, you get so far in then find you have to destroy parts of the city to build new things meaning finding a balance is more of a struggle than a challenge and takes the fun out of it. If they make the city maps larger I will happily rate this 6/7 out of 10 as this will make the gameplay so much more fun.… ",

When I finally could play, I saw first hand what everyone was complaining about: dumb AI, uselessly small maps, and the DRM is infuriating, I lost whatever progress my tiny city made because the game would not save or lost connection somehow. All in all, I uninstalled the program after playing it three times, and since EA does not give refunds on online downloads, I feel like a sucker for giving SimCity 5 the benefit of the doubt. (PS. I bought this game in April but someone just brought up the topic and the memories enraged me enough to write this review)… ",

All of us where waiting for the return of the Simcity saga with a stunning performance of Maxis, but instead of having a master game and they gave us just a simplified version of the previous game Simcity 4, but we must say that the graphical advances of this game are a huge advance. Talking about the negatives points,, as I said at the beginning: this is a simplified version ,I mean that the lots o transports that were in SC4 like highways (that are already there by the game), monorail, subway, train, etc. were all removed. Another thing that has get the most of the critics is the fact that you must be online to play a single player game, that\u0027s something incredible, in this game is well know by the users that if the server reached its maximum capacity you can play and you will have to wait until you are allowed to play and the server has a little space four you game, another thing that captured our attention us that the space for the city is too small, you can\u0027t rise a metropolis in that tiny space. And finishing the negative points, we see that the buildings for every tools or service is limited to 3 or 4 compared to SC4 where in police you could have like 5 or 6 buildings, but that\u0027s obvious, isn\u0027t it? a few things for a little space. In the other hand, this game has some positive things. Starting from the 3d camera that allows you to see every corner of the city and the extraordinary graphics that it has. For me there are two important things that wasn´t in the previous games of the franchise: 1) The multiplayer mode: it allows you to play with other people in the world if you have an Internet or LAN connection, it\u0027s based in a region where the players have a city and they interact with the other ones for better or worse, and every city has a role. 2) The city role: in CS4, the cities interact with each other but It wasn´t like now, in Simcity 5 the cities perform a specific role, for example: you have a tourist city, an industrial city, a casino city, a city based on minery and other kinds. Others things like, the add-ons in the buildings is another advance and the realistic geographic conditions, like the places were is water under the ground, the way the wind blows or the mineral that are in the ground. In conclusion. I can say that the users expected more of this game, and for now we will go on using Simcity 4, almost we must admit that correcting this negatives things and we combine this with SC4 I can ensure you that this will be the best urban simulator ever, but by now we will have to wait until EA and Maxis decide to take this franchise more seriously and take it back to the place it must be.… ",

The game has some design flaws that make it really hard to enjoy once you finally accept the fact that you no longer control a city but need to take care of a bunch of them in order to reach the upper levels of development or cooperate with friends or random people. Still, the difficulty level is so low (with limited options in terms of finance or policies that were present in past SImCity games), that people looking for a challenge should steer away from this product as the problems you may get come from faulty game mechanics, not the level of proficiency needed to design and maintain a city. There are still major problems with connectivity after so many months and it\u0027s more than just a nuisance when you can\u0027t even play singleplayer because servers are full... Plus, you can loose a city you built! Regions just disappear from the servers or they are there but you won\u0027t be able to access them getting an error message frustrating at best. Given the franchise history, the developer of the game and the publisher, this should have been at least a 8/10 game. At the moment, after a countless number of patches focused on resolving issues with people being able to play at all, not addressing real issues like malfunctioning game design (horrible transportation aspect for instance and constant problems with that no matter what you try to do with it), this game is a 5/10 for me and that\u0027s only because I still hope that major problems will be resolved and that this game will be playable. If you\u0027re new to the genre, go play something else. Veterans you have been warned.… ",

Obsessed with their need for Origins to be successful, obsessed about piracy, which is irrelevant in a world where the number of happy paying customers is booming, obsessed about getting as much blood from a stone as they can with DLC and micro-transactions, EA corporate apparently spends zero time thinking about games, the gamer of the gaming experience. EA seems to be rendered insane by its own greed. It has a genius for destroying games and the fun of gaming. And by all appearances there is no one with any power or control in EA who actually CARES about this either. Look at the millions and millions they blow on advertising! Look at the way gameplay and game fun and game design considerations stagnate or go backwards and get worse! What\u0027s wrong with this company? Why are the fools crashing the ships into the rocks NOT getting sacked? The answer can only be that the rot is coming from the very top. It\u0027s the EA executives who are making this company a joke. These are obviously men with big egos who never actually play games, and feel an innate contempt for gamers, indeed for games. Gamers should seriously boycott the products of this company, because it\u0027s evident from the long string of ruined franchises and studios EA has destroyed in the past 2 years that this company represents a DISEASED corporate culture that will obviously continue so long as the corporate machine is making revenue. Until EA starts taking significant financial losses on their horribly skewed \u0027games\u0027 they have no real reason to change what they are doing. This game is a horrible warning sign of how EA hopes to suck gamers into a DLC-addled, micro-transaction infested, pay-to-play, pay to win, charge by the month toll booth on our lives. They have so much contempt for games and gamers that they even try to chain us to their machine with BAD games. Like we are DUMB enough to allow it. The answer is to say NO. Don\u0027t buy their games. Score bomb their games. Don\u0027t support these people. EVER. Buy from companies with a better philosphy and with more love for the art and fun that represent gaming at its best. Starve the beast. EA is truly, really, deeply SICK. The shareholders need to replace the entire executive of the business with people who actually, know, love, understand and live for making good games. A company with the financial resources to be an industry leader should be an industry leader. Right now they are wasting and losing billions in potential revenue. They are not only losing-out in terms of game design, creativity and popularity, they are missing BILLIONS in revenue. They are a bad publisher and a BAD business model. Dozens of corporate shills in suits with no understanding of games, gaming or gamers need to be permanently retired, starting with ALL their present executives. A Sim City in 2013 should have been a blow-your mind awesome experience not only in the dimensions of cartoon world creation, but also in hyper-real SERIOUS civic engineering. It could have and should have been not only a toy, but a platform that could be used by architects and engineers to mock up real-world projects. Instead of investing in a state of the art engine however, EA blew its budget on hookers and blow again: AS ALWAYS: giving us a sad reboot of a 1997 experience on the back of a vast, wasted advertising budget. Casuals don\u0027t care and will get their kicks elsewhere. The hardcore knowingly laugh. Why do these fools make games for 12 year old, and hope to use DLC and micro transactions to get kids to hit their folks with the credit card? Does no-one with authority in EA have the slightest interest in ACTUALLY MAKING GOOD STATE OF THE ART SOFTWARE? If they stopped trying so hard to work angles with DLC and such and just made plain awesome games they would double their profits in 12 months and start to regain some of the good will they have so steadily squandered in the past three years! SACK the present boss and reset your agenda ! THE GROT REVIEW CRITERIA: After a long time writing reviews like an anus, think its time to set a few bad habits straight: Stop insulting designers. Show some respect for the design process and getting games in circulation. Hence (1) No Red scores. (2) Game scores as follows: Bad Game 5/10. Poor Game 6/10. Mediocre Game: 7/10. Good Game 8/10. Great game 9/10. Stella Game 10/10. To get 10/10 it must be a game that can be (theoretically) play-able for 1000+ hours. Not only great but near endless fun. Games may be bad or poor but making them should earn respect. Thus even the worst POS will still be a 5/10. 0/10 no longer exists in my vocabulary. Yellow is the new red. For the sake o… ",

The old games were statistically based and what you saw on screen was just a representation of what might be happening in the city (hence why cars faded in and out around corners). This new game simulates using an agent based system. Now every home has sims that need work, need education, happiness, money, etc... For example, Andy will leave home in the morning and must get to work before 9am. So long as he makes it, when he leaves at the end of the day he will bring home money. That money will be spent in shops which will make him happy. And so on, and so on. That my friends, is revolutionary! You can really start to appreciate how difficult this must have been for them to create. I\u0027m not saying this is an excuse to release a buggy, half-finished game, but those who wanted SimCity 4 with updated graphics need to look elsewhere. This is not what the game was intending to be. To add to that city builders are difficult! Look at Cities XL, and before that, SC4. Both were, and still are really buggy! Not just that, but they bring even the best computers to their knees. There is just so much to calculate (even with a statistically based model)!

Hopefully since this game is an \"online\" game that can theoretically \"evolve\", this can eventually be expanded. If city sites are to be small, they should also show some variation instead of just being same sized square boxes. Some reviewers state that a city in real life \"cannot have all things\"... simply not true. New York City for instance is not \"buildable\" in the games current form. The game really does need the ability to \"expand\" beyond a square box borders. Elimination of some items (ie subways) Fact that you\u0027re \"buying\" a game that may someday be no longer supported, in a sense you\u0027re \"buying\" a game that\u0027s in some ways being treated as a rental. While a good start (I hope they don\u0027t stand pat), the regions concept is just not realistic in the sense that you have multiple \"squares\" for cities... while the land separating these squares are never \"develop-able\". In the end, I\u0027m not sure if I had it to do all over again, I would spend $60. The online feature of the game is not that big a deal however the unrealistic nature of the game (in the name of multi-player) is pretty disappointing when compared to past versions. I\u0027m open to something \"new\" but not if it only \"limits\" your \"powers\", so to speak. Right now, I\u0027d advise people to wait to see if the developers improve the game. In some ways it\u0027s an improvement but in too many others, it\u0027s a regression. Looking forward to playing it but overall, fairly disappointed. One last thought Similar to EA Sims franchise, they tend to \"nickel and dime\" you for every new minor feature... that seems to be where they\u0027re headed with this as well. Before offering all these new \"bells and whistles\" for a price, they really need to expand the space on which you are able to build. It\u0027s interesting they did not name it SimCity 5... Truth be told, it\u0027s more like SimCity 2.8 3.2... Sim City 4 is still superior to this new effort.… ",

I prepared for the worst, but what I got was my favorite game in the franchise to date. I loved it... The problems people said they had with the server were basically non-existent for me and I never had trouble with crashing. I loved the gameplay, though the city size definitely is to small. I love the camera controls, which are very responsive and crisp. I also greatly enjoyed the graphical style of the game, it felt more like a city than any of the previous other games had. I also enjoyed the curved roads, naturally. Sometimes clipping onto roads was annoying but for the most part it worked out well. The modules you can add to buildings are AMAZING, definitely one of my favorite additions, much more efficient to add more cops cars to your police station than to build an entire other one.

If you look at their Facebook almost every comment is from people who want bigger maps. Surely the next update has to be bigger maps? no.

In the old titles, you spent countless hours on one city, and from then on there was no comparing. However, in SC5 you build many small cities in a region, each with different specialties. Some work, some don\u0027t. But they can help each other, (making it nice not to have to start from square one each time), and you can work alone or with friends toward greater projects (\"great works\"). All said, if you were initially frustrated like I was with the game, give it another go.

Pros: Beautiful graphics and great audio Cons: Small map sizes, severe traffic control problems, enormous structures, residential is not dense enough for map size. Unfortunately the map size in relation to the structure sizes makes it incredibly difficult to fit in enough residential space in addition to city specialization structures and standard infrastructure i.e. water pumps, city hall, power plants, trash disposal, mining operations, electronics factories, casinos, and universities. If they wanted to make them so big, then they should have given us bigger maps. The other glaring issues is that trade is near impossible once your city becomes large enough. There is literally one entry into the city. This results in a major bottleneck for traffic and causes major backups. This problem will result in lost or inconsistent input of revenue causing cash flow problems. I believe that this results mostly from the fact that all city transit options flow on the roads and there is no subway to speak of to help offset some of the travelers. I extensively used subways in SimCity 3000 Unlimited and rarely had real traffic control problems. Don\u0027t waste your money on this disappointment like I did.… ",

I wish they hadn\u0027t sold out. Gaming companies that are successful today, listen to their community. EA has not been doing that. For anyone thinking about buying Simcity 2013. Please do not, until you read a review in 5 years that says that came is actually functioning correctly.

Now on to game play, which the raw gameplay itself I found to be very good--detailed buildings, individual sims, etc. I also enjoyed upgrading buildings and working toward certain goals to unlock more options in the game. However, as others have pointed out, the maps are smaller than I would have liked and there\u0027s no option that gives you larger maps. Overall, the game was okay but it could have been a whole lot better.… ",

As it is a SimCity game and it featured most of the things you would of expected from a SimCity game. It even had some nice features like you could play online with others. It had a nice feature where you could play multiple cities in a region at the same time. Specializing each city. Therefore one could be the commercial area. Another the residential. Another the industrial. So in theory and what you got when you bought it, it was probably a 10. However what destroyed the game was EA\u0027s greed. They forced you to join Origin. They forced you to play the game online. But then they didn\u0027t have the capacity on the Origin servers to handle the masses of SimCity fans who were trying to build their cities. Remember everyone was forced to play online. This caused lag. Which in a city sim, that was happening in live time causes massive problems. From the cars, to crime, to pollution. This could cause whole sections of your city to just fall apart with no apparent way to fix it. It also caused the game to behave illogically and not be able to handle multiple specialized cities very well. For instance when I built a commercial area that was near a residential city, that was also sending electricity, water and other resources to build up the commercial city. The game was sure there weren\u0027t enough people to support it. Even though the residential city needed tons and tons of jobs and places to shop. Same with the industrial. You could start up a regular city and then rebuild it. But it\u0027s illogical multiplayer flaws coupled with lag could just ruin your gaming experience. This was especially a problem for those serious builders. As EA was trying to promote building competitions. The lag made things ugly really fast. When you couple this lag with bugs, bad pathing, and illogical flaws in the new ai the game was all but doomed. It\u0027s sad really as most of these flaws would of eventually been patched and everyone who purchased this game would of been happy rating it 8 or better easily. And most of the flaws were probably caused by the lag of the server you were forced to play on. I played solo, or private games where I invited friends. I have highs speed internet, but being forced to play on the Origin server which was lagged out of it\u0027s mind, just ruined the game for everyone. It is so sad because if we could of played this game solo, or on our own servers this game would probably have been a classic. Which all of us would be replaying for years to come. But instead EA decided they would stop game hackers by forcing them to play on their servers. Sadly those who cracked the games are probably the only ones who can enjoy the game in the state I last saw it. And this policy for what was traditionally an offline game, ruined it. Without stopping the hackers. In fact it was a PR problem for EA as they said you couldn\u0027t play the game offline. But people were quickly finding evidence that the game could probably be patched to be able to play offline. If EA just put out a patch that allowed us to play the game on our own computers or our own servers this game would be saved. Which would save the game for those who want to use the game on Origin, because Origin wouldn\u0027t have it\u0027s servers lagged. And it might help restore EA\u0027s reputation. Sadly EA already stole the money from all who bought this game. And sadly it seems EA is not concerned with keeping SimCity as customers. In the end the game launched so badly that EA had Origin give players a free game. Which is okay, if you actually enjoy having to log into someone else\u0027s server just to play a game. But it\u0027s quite annoying when it destroys a classic franchise. And a game that should be able to be enjoyed offline.… ",

EA deliberately sold a game which they knew its customers would not be able to play in full or in part for some period of time, to be determined, after launch. 3. As many have pointed out in the past, this is effectively fraud. Deliberately selling a product that does not work is unacceptable in almost any industry, and should be considered criminal. 4. These actions show once again that EA treats its customers with complete contempt. It has been rated as the worst company in America in 2012 for good reason. Solution: 1. Do not buy this or any other games from this EA. 2. Do not buy this or any other game requiring on-line play for single player games. This is the only way they will pay attention. As long as we continue to give them money, they will continue to perpetrate this fraud. Hit them in the wallet and they will wake up in a hurry.

So what does this mean? The engine is rubbish because it can\u0027t simulate a city. Each citizen lives in the nearest free home in relation to his position at the moment he wants to go home. Thus each citizen lives each day in a different home and because every citizen does this, there is always a huge traffic jam, because every citizen goes to the same home, than to the next and so on. This is also true for work, shopping etc. In conclusion the roads ware always full and a city with more than 10.000 people (which aren\u0027t exactly 10.000 units, more 100 or so) will not work, the jams will hold your trucks which are needed for your production line. Of course, fire trucks and the other public service cars will stuck in traffic too. They don\u0027t get an extra lane, the even have to wait if the lights are red and no car will make room for them. Thus your city will burn down. Because of the engine, every truck will drive to the next fire, not to a fire with no truck already moving in. But never the less this game is fun to play, until you notice, that you can\u0027t optimize the roads and your public service because of the broken engine. So if this was it, I would give this game a 4 or 5 out of 10, because it will take you a while to notice. But EA lied about this game and is still lying because the are selling it as a simulation of a city. But this game does not simulate anything. The even bring out DLCs and AddOn which make the problems worse or are simply overprices and/or bring ingame advertising with them instead of fixing the engine (maybe it\u0027s not possible). The maps are ridicule small sized and the DRM is a pain, because the benefits (trade with neighbor cities) are not working proper. So I give this game a 1, it is more a 0 but if you naively think that your city planing is the issue, like me, it is fun to play a while until you notice the limits of this fake simulation engine ;)… ",

It\u0027s stupid that people rate this so low because of issues already fixed and the DRM (always online DRM works really well, really few people pirated it before the offline mode came out). People are idiots. It works well on old PCs, it looks good, it\u0027s a lot of fun. The cities are big enough.… ",

Downloading from Origin was fairly straightforward and the game was up and running within an hour of purchase. Visually, the game is very very good. It looks like an animated model at extreme zoom levels and it\u0027s quite nice to just sit back and watch the sims go by while having a coffee. It\u0027s like Sim Parisian Cafe! The tutorials are straightforward, the controls straightforward and the user interface is very visually appealing. On the downside, some of the building menus are a bit hard to navigate. You\u0027ll often be asked to build a church, for example, and then give up because the church is hidden in the City Specialization -\u003e Culture -\u003e Worship menu. The maps are small, although it does make the game more challenging and, dare I say realistic, as you can\u0027t just plop a building down and build a few houses for the workers - you really have to think about how to balance competing land use demands in order to make the city work. A lot of complaints centre on map size, and it is true, they are much smaller than they were in Sim City 4. However, intelligent region play can overcome the limitations of city size by enabling resource sharing, effectively turning separate cities into a conurbation. My main gripe is the DLC. It is absolutely terrible. $10 for a building set that gives you a double decker bus, Big Ben and a couple of British-looking buildings? $5 for a few airships or $10 for an amusement park that appears to promise the kind of creative madness of Roller Coaster Tycoon, but ends up being more like Zoo Tycoon. EA removed the modding freedom that Sim City 4 gave us in order to maximize profits from DLC. I don\u0027t mind that so much, they are a business and they have to generate revenue, but don\u0027t expect value for money because there really isn\u0027t much to be had. Wait for the GOTY edition or some bulk bundles and save your cash, because the current DLC is not worth it.… ",

Not calling the game \"Sim City 5\" but just \"SimCity\" is very appropriate; because it clearly does not continue the success of it\u0027s predecessors. The list of issues is huge: - Cities not buying the required amount of power and water even though there is plenty of water and power to receive from the cities I have setup contracts to buy from. Forces you to utility buildings in your main city wasting valuable space and land value. - Tourists suddenly not coming to your city for no good reason at all, after you\u0027ve had great success with tourist for a long while and made no changes. Suddenly they just not come anymore destroying your income completely forcing you to re specialize. Which is NOT fun. - Water tables drying out and not refilling unless you friggin build a sewage treatment plant just next to your water pump. What the hell is that about?! Like the only way to get clean water is from a sewage treatment plant... Rivers not having any positive effect on water table at... - Tiny city sizes... - Enormous traffic jams on intercity highways and absolutely no way of improving or building more. Only one road connection to intercity highway causing at times great traffic jams in your city at that road junction. - Street cars getting stuck and not moving. Can be \u0027fixed\u0027 by removing and readding section of road in front of street car depot, or sometimes streetcar depot needs to be removed. Not fun. - Cities got lost due to EA\u0027s crappy servers. Many many thousands of players experienced this. - Gifts of goods, like plastic and such, from one city to another cannot even be partially deliver if receiving city does not have storage to receive the whole lot in one go. The deliver truck will be forever stuck in the intercity highway until receiving city builds storage big enough to receive the delivery in one go. Who at Maxis/EA thought that was a good idea?? How hard can it be to implement partial delivery...? - Deliveries of goods to great works get stuck in the intercity highway traffic jam and often the delivery disappears or roam for a very long time. - Cities of Tomorrow DLC prevents you from claiming cities other players with this DLC have constructed and left, forcing you to buy DLC... - While music is not actually bad, it is a pathetic attempt compared to the genius godly sound track of Sim City 4 (search Sim City 4 OST on Youtube if you haven\u0027t heard it before). Bu tin that sense SimCity\u0027s music does fit the rest of the game. - All buildings, both zonable buildings and utility buildings etc. will demolish when just at single patch of road along it\u0027s side is demolished. I don\u0027t get why that is necessary and it only serves to needlessly complicate rearranging city structure. For example a road can be just next to a utility building and the module to place does not have any other space to be than on the same space as the road. Demolishing the road and replacing it elsewhere and replacing the utility building makes space to place the module on that exact same side. It\u0027s crazy that you can\u0027t do this without demolishing the whole main building structure. - Crappy low value with very limited content DLC\u0027s that sell for high prices - Great work sometimes not receiving any power (even though your cities clearly has lots of excess power) effectively destroying the whole purpose of great works. I could go on and on and on but whats the point. I don\u0027t even want to talk about the (few) positive aspects. F*** you EA, go to hell and leave our games alone… ",

Firstly, the maps are pretty small. This can seem like an annoyance at first, but it really makes you think a lot more about how you layout everything. Megatowers also let you build your city up, instead of out, so you can still have high populations, without taking up so much surface area. It it\u0027s current state, the game has no bugs, no server problems, and the option of offline play. So you can flush 99% of the complaints here down the drain. EA/Maxis took a pretty big risk changing the game as much as they did, but I appreicate that. Most sequels these days just regurgitate the same game and put a 60$ tag on it. The new presentation and UI is very nice, and I think it\u0027s awesome they added trading, and commodity resources. It really adds a new appeal to the classic SimCity theme. Not to mention multiplayer! Playing with friends is a lot of fun, and it\u0027s cool coordinating city roles with your buddies online, and filling in for each other\u0027s gaps.

I gave this game 3 chances spaced out a couple between each and well still makes me want to hurl to be honest. I got this game after all the online crap got sorted out so have nothing to say about that overly. the city size is small as all other people have said you need to make other cities to help your city cause you cant build a mega metropilis on this small lot (sims reference :p ) where on sim city 4 you could make wonderful huge cities even on smaller areas with everything packed into it it had a hard learning curve to get a good economy and money in the positive but it made so much more sense. conclusion this games not good for majority of sim city players will not like this at all, I can see more sim players liking this over sim city players (not insulting sim players by the way) it looks pretty and that\u0027s about it this game feels like a demo of sim city 4 just prettier is all. instead of building a huge city with every building in it sometimes almost 1 million people they give you this dumb downed little plot of land to make a small town (it feels like it anyways) I regret buying this game I tried to like it but even how they changed the interface of building and nerfed city size I try to like it but I cant. final advice if your still considering this game after all these reviews people have done make sure you watch tons of review videos, gameplay videos etc learn everything you can about it at first glanced looked pretty good seemed somewhat similar but after I installed it started it up waited 3 hours for updates ontop of that started the game itself made my little plot of land and puked in my mouth it seems. First review for a game on here (sadly this one) and all those reasons up there is why its a 2/10 for me.… ",

Gone is the easy and free placement of buildings, parks, etc. gone is the simple zoning... and in it\u0027s place are a lot of empty spaces that you can\u0027t fill because everything is bound to the road system. There\u0027s also annoyances with the fact that so early on in a serious game you can lose money just by building roads and not have enough money to buy police, fire and medical services which your city will desperately need early on. I go on about the littlest of details but that\u0027s what made the previous games successful, the little details that you can change and dictate yourself because it\u0027s your city, not EA\u0027s city. I really hope in the future somebody just buys out maxis and gives them free reigns over the work they used to produce. There is so much potential in the Sim City franchise and long times fans like me have been dreaming of a true sequel to Sim City 4... but it\u0027s sad that publishers these days particularly EA just care about appealing to a wider audience to get tons of money and doing it in the least amount of effort possible.… ",

It is a case in point that shows graphics are not everything. Modding might make this game much better with time (like it did for SC4) but considering EA right now appears to be not as friendly towards it as it was when SC4 was released (so they can release their overpriced DLCs in the first place), the crippled region play without terraforming and lack of creative control, all these factors but make this game very boring after a couple of hours of play. Definitively not worth the 60$+ it cost at launch and still not the 20$ it costs right now unless you are a very casual player just looking to play town mayor with some pretty 3D graphics once in a while. If you want to go anywhere further in the field of city simulator use that money to get either SC4 or Cities XL. Pros: - Decent full 3D graphics. - Roads can now be built curved, elevated, etc. - Improved simulation of town\u0027s inhabitants. (may or may not be important depending on your style of play). Nice with the bus and ground rail transit options the game offers. - Online mode can make for some fun moments with friends though this was already possible in SC4 in a slower and more cumbersome scale. - Upgradeable buildings. Cons: Pretty much everything else. - Ridiculously small town sizes. More like small neighborhoods. In paper \"2 x 2\" km wide (or about 1.25 mi by 1.25 mi) but considering that roads take much more space than they used to in SC4 or in real life, the maps appear to be much more smaller than that. Using roads as reference, maps are about 0.5 km wide. So yea, the 2 x 2 km SC city has about 1/16th of the area of a medium tile city in SC4 (which is supposed to be 2 x 2 km wide as well) and 1/4th of the smallest cities in SC4 that are 1 km wide. There is a mod that increases their size a bit but with region and lag problems described below, use it at your own risk. - The above would be not such a big deal if they were side by side like SC4 had but alas the towns are spread apart and there is nothing in between them but a few roads linking them together. After building your towns - which can be done in less than an hour easily in each town, and in a day or two in all towns inside a region - you are left with a terribly unrealistic looking region with packed squared shaped towns scattered in a region of blank space. You cannot even add extra city connections. - Building sizes in contrast appear very small relative to the roads they border. Even SC4 had size scaling problems (roads and buildings) but yea, they go to a whole new level in SC. - Cities can achieve populations similar to their counterparts in older games, but that just makes your cities appear even more unrealistic and silly than they are already appear to. For example, a 350k city would have 1.4 mil people per square kilometer in SC, using the size above, in SC4 medium city same population 56k, while the densest cities have about 100k to 20k. - No ability to create new maps or even terraform whatsoever. Towns appear in the region locked in place and you cannot even change their location. So if you dislike that big hill or that piece of river bed inside your town or a new region altogether you are pretty much screwed. - Curved roads create big spaces of wasted space, a very minor problem on its own but considering you do not have a lot of space to begin with, often you are left wondering why build them in the first place? Speaking of which no freeways or one way roads to begin with. Even gridded layouts have plenty of wasted space. - Zone density way too simplified and is based off only on the type of road used to zone them, further stiffling creative control. Since buildings are based off the road they are beside at if you demolish the road you also end up demolishing the buildings... Everything has to be beside roads, even parks. - No subways or agriculture. Not that they would fit in in 0.5 km wide towns anyway. - Lag problems when your city gets more and more populated. Suddenly, trying to simulate 350k+ people on a game daily basis does not appear to be that enticing... - The game was online mode only (for a game that screams single player over and over again) for over a year and had huge server issues in the first month or so after its release. While they bear no weight on how the game is right now after the offline patch it is outrageous that we had to wait a year for that to happen at all. Especially considering that they lied that this was impossible to begin with. - Overpriced DLCs that offer very little for your buck. SC4 has plenty of similar mods and plugins that are completely free to begin with. Pros or Cons depending on your style of play: - Increased options for trade of goods and services between towns. Some of them I find them quite unrealistic though. At least it mitigates (minimally) the small town sizes. - Water and power built automatically under roads.… ",

Некрасиво смотрится. - Молчу про крупные проекты. Идея интересная, но её вы, разработчики, развили очень плохо. - Хреновая интеграция между городами (лень описывать) - Раздражает пиздец как ленивое население - при наличии 20 тыс разных вакансий 10 тыс человек так и остаются безработными (при условии ур. вакансии равен уровню жителя) - Электричество распространяется очень медленно - чушь, ибо скорость электричества равна 250 тыс/км, а не как в игре. - Та же тема с водой и канализацией.

And path finding issues such the \u0027cant find work\u0027 problem despite there being available work in a commercial building with wealth-matching jobs right next door. But these are minor issues. At least traffic now works properly. Compared to the previous games this is a breath of fresh air, the new 3D system works well, nice visuals and animations. It can be quite a challenge building a profitable city, balancing out wealth, crime, fire coverage, managing traffic, optimizing trade, futurizing the city, building successful casino\u0027s, getting everything balanced up to the point where the city can just run itself for hours with no input. But at this point there is not much else to do, the city is running fine, time to build another city, then another, then another, then it\u0027s like - what now? I suppose the other games had the same issue, but with the other games you could bulldoze a quarter of the city and redesign whole areas, relocate industrial etc... In this game you can\u0027t really do that due to the limited space, perhaps the game should have been called SimCityCentral or SimCBD because that\u0027s pretty much the area size you have to play with. If the city size was 200% - 300% larger it would be far far more enjoyable. Larger city sizes would allow you to create suburb areas, a city area, farming area, proper highways - this is simply not possible in this game. Bit of a shame. It is the biggest flaw of an otherwise brilliant game. I would probably give it 92/100 if the city size was larger. But it gets 82/100 from me.… ",

It doesn\u0027t look \"bad\" as such, but it isn\u0027t what I\u0027m looking for in a city simulator; why micromanage something that doesn\u0027t take itself seriously? Don\u0027t get me wrong, adding a bit of fun and quirkiness has always been a feature of the Sim games, but that can be done by the context of the game (such as the llama references and such) rather than with the graphical look. The maps are so small that it should be called Sim Village. They even managed to ruin the UI, which was one of the only weaknesses in Sim City 4 - it\u0027s now outright annoying. So even at a low price, I can\u0027t recommend this title. Sim City 4 is available on GOG and is comfortably the superior game in pretty much every respect. In summary, Sim City and Sims 4 shows how far EA have fell with this franchise. Both are cash cows for the gullible, and I won\u0027t be caught out again.… ",

I\u0027ve been a huge fan of simcity4 and played it for a very long time, i can see why ppl are upset about this game, it had lost of problems when it first started and it had DRM up the ass, however i think EA realized that and they (with time) worked around it. you can actually play offline now and you can port maps form online to offline. now the game it self is pretty fun and gets you what you expect out of a simcity game, it is a bit easier and less challenging that simcity4, however this is not the biggest problem with this game, the biggest problem is that the map size is WAaaay too small. you can fill it up in 1 hour or 2 Max. this is a huge let down as the game is beautiful and form what i seen lots of thoughts went to it.this leads up to you filling up the landscape before you can build most of its buildings. if you get this game its a very beautiful game with lots of things that you can try, i recommend getting the complete edition because of the content it ships with it.however as i said before this space which you can build on is really small and you wont be able to build a huge metropolis as you could on simcity4 or other games. this games is not bad on its own but its not any better than other games ether in the same series or other competitors.… ",

A better communication system should be added. And the biggest weakness in the game is the city sizes. The size of a city in SimCity is very small and square. It doesn\u0027t let me have much space for me to expand my city. The concept for a multiplayer city builder sounds great, but in reality, not everyone is a top-notch city planner. So playing with other people maybe enjoyable. So far I\u0027ve been playing for about 20-30hrs, and I really enjoyed the game. I recommend buying it when it\u0027s on sale.… ",

I believe that the game was built fairly well for the smaller cites. Even though there were a few other shortcomings in some features, they are fairly small, and I think that if the publisher was not EA, nobody would care nearly so much.

This isn\u0027t due to traffic issues, or a wealth mis-match, its an obvious defect. They game looks great - but is a blatant fail in terms of usability.

What\u0027s cool is that this SimCity includes so many aspects of how regional planning works. Cities don\u0027t exist in a vacuum, so even if the cities are a little smaller in this version, the game is more rich because it includes regional scale planning!",

There was also no possibility of expanding the land. Looking back, you can see that they stayed halfway despite innovating with GlassBox game engine.",

I would recommend getting Simcity 2k or one of the older games if you want a Simcity game or City Skylines.",

Как только я купил эту игру в Ориджине и скачал, у меня при запуске сначала выдавалась ошибка, что из-за чего мне пришлось перезапускать игру. Вообще лучше купить Cities: Skylines.… ",

Having spent $5 on Origin Access I acquired access to this game. It was something that caught my attention and was willing to try. Its been 5 days counting the day of this review and I have played well over 10 hours straight every day. I couldn\u0027t put it down. I was addicted to it. Unlocking new tech, and trying to master the game and unlock everything was a fun and very rewarding challenge. 54 hours later and I can say I finally feel satisfied that I have accomplished everything available in the game. That being said the game is a solid 7 no less. Its not innovative but it has something about it that just hooks you and makes you want to keep trying and learning until you finally master it. Absolutely worth $5 through Origin access. Hell this game is worth $5 by it self. Really recommend it. Its a good break from R6 Siege (800 hours), COD (BO2 1000 hours) Battlefield 3-4-1, Killing Floor, GTA 5. Totally worth it on sale. Check it out!… ",

The servers crash a lot! Also, it is a lot smaller and easier than other SimCity games as I have heard. For me, you should wait for this to go on sale.",

The gameplay is completely different from SimCity 4, but very fun and addictive. It has many big bugs, never fixed, the game was abandoned 1 year after the release. What a pity!

Played years later and it seems like i can rate it at 2 or 3 but found out the crashing of loss of net connection was a deliberate part on the developers and also contrasted this game to Cities Skylines. The game this should have been then we find ourselves at 1. I know people complain that every release of NBA2K, Fifa or COD are the same every year but those are released EVERY YEAR. we get city simulators every 4 to 6 years so I cant complain if it is not THAT different from the previous game. Quality of life improvements and feedback from player suggestions can go a long way.… ",
