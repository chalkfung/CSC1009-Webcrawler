I played Oblivion, Skyrim, Witcher 1-3 (and Mount and Blade) to death and as much as I love them, this is different. I\u0027ve always wanted the most realistic, most immersive medieval game to exist. Well...Since February 13th 2018 it DOES exist. You should NOT expect fantasy elements or Action 24/7, this is not what the middle ages were like. -The storytelling and setting is beautiful -It IS immersive like no other game I\u0027ve played so far -The weapons system is original and challenging (positively) -Your decisions DO matter, and the KI is one of the most intriguing ones I\u0027ve seen so far. Let\u0027s talk about performance: Win10, i5-8400, Radeon RX480, 16gb DDR4-2666, SSD (important!) I play on 1920x1080, everything set to very high (+ objects on ultra), and NEVER dropped below 40 so far. On average I\u0027m between 55-60. But I\u0027d be a liar if I said this game doesn\u0027t have any problems: - The saving system: As much as I like the idea of being forced to think twice before saving because you might not be able to in the next hours for some reason, there should be an option to switch it on/off - can easily be patched - the minor bugs I talked about - can and will be easily patched - loading time on HDD: installing the game on a SSD apparently makes even a bigger difference than I thought. While I have practically NO loading times (between conversations f.e), others have complained about annoyingly long times. So to anyone thinking about buying the game: Do you like games like Mount and Blade, Skyrim, Witcher? (KC:D combines many elements of those 3) Do you like (mostly) historically accurate RPG games in a medieval setting? If the answers are yes, you might be as happy with the game as I am.… ",

Kingdom Come is surely for the more hardcore-minded RPG players, and frankly, not for the younger generation whose only RPG so far has been Skyrim, Witcher 3 or both. However, this game is everything I hoped it would be, and I couldn\u0027t be happier. Storytelling is on point, albeit the game starts with the same premise as just about every other 80\u0027s movie. It\u0027s not a bad thing by any means; more like a tried and true approach. The game just sucks you in from the start, and you hunger to explore all the nooks in the environment. The battle mechanics are a breath of fresh air, and realistic. For example, if you\u0027re wearing plain clothes and a looter hits you with a sword, you\u0027re done. But, don some proper armor, and you\u0027ll be fine. In every other game, your armor makes negligible difference, as the timing of blocks, parries and dodges makes for more exciting game play. Not in KC:D. If a guy comes at you with a knife and you\u0027re wearing undies, you are dead. I love it. There are somethings to get used to in the environment, though. For example, not everything is lootable as with many of the predecessors, and the things that are lootable don\u0027t really stick out. For example, you can find a barrel of arrows right next to a barrel of halberds, but only the arrows are lootable. Contrary to this intuition, you can pick up a bow just propped at a corner, but not an axe stuck to a tree trunk. A lot of people also complain about lock picking mechanics, which are not that intuitive. That is to say, they do not follow the same logic as in Skyrim for example, but it takes only a few tries to master the mechanic. With a little fine tuning on consoles, there should be no gripes there either. Overall, it\u0027s these little things that prevent me from giving a 10/10, while I ignore the current bugs in the game. And let\u0027s be honest, there are a LOT of bugs. If you are bothered by performance issues and expect to play a perfectly fine-tuned game, I\u0027d recommend waiting a month or two for the devs to iron everything out.… ",

However, this is not impeding my enjoyment of the game. Coming from a new developer, this game is very impressive for the story that it tells, the free-form approach to questing, and the surprisingly deep and satisfying combat. Kingdom Come Deliverance does not shy away from trying to stand out from other triple A RPG\u0027s. In addition to the aforementioned combat system, it ditches whimsical fantasy for a gritty historical experience. It also has little quirks that make it unique. For instance, it requires you to manage basic metrics like hunger level, and encourages you to experiment with creative solutions to quests. Try talking to an character with blood splattered on your armor and you\u0027ll get a very different conversation than one you approach after doing the laundry. Saving isn\u0027t done in a menu, it\u0027s done by sleeping or drinking a potion. During fast travel, you can come across merchants and other characters. It\u0027s things like this that make KCD a refreshing role playing game through and through. You\u0027ll hear about bugs and lack of polish, but these issues are far outweighed by the experience I\u0027m having so far. Besides, like most other games that launched with issues (even Witcher 3 had its launch problems), I\u0027m sure these will be ironed out with patches soon. I give Kingdom Come Deliverance a 10/10 for a very good first attempt by a nascent studio.… ",

The voice acting is mostly great, the lipsync is occasionally not adequate though. The story so far exceeded my expectations, its pretty tense, makes sense and is very educational actually. As far as I checked and from what I remember from history classes, its historically accurate which really makes you immersed in the story. The audio, especially the medieval themes is a treat. The combat is a bit clunky and takes time to get used to, its very much a Mount \u0026 Blade inspired directional strike and block system, though slower. Its a good compromise imo, fitting for their \"realistic\" theme. Other mechanics like lock picking and alchemy are great imo. The biggest problem for me so far are the absolutely unnecessary picking up animations, they are incredibly repetitive and those 2 seconds will feel like eternity after a while. The dialogues are a mixed bag, sometimes they feel organic, sometimes there are awkward pauses and out of place intonations, all in all though, the exchanges are enjoyable and often hilarious(in a good way). The looting system is alright, if you´re one of those hema nuts, you´ll be impressed by all the layers of equipment and gear you can put on. You can also choose your style, you can solve most of your problems if your speech is good enough and you choose correctly, if you want to go rambo, you can do that as well and if you want to sneak around and steal everything, that option is there too. All in all, its a pretty complex single player rpg with amazing visuals with pretty fresh and original setting and as far as I can tell, with a very high replay value.… ",

After a long wait, after tribulations and falls, the traffic sign and the iron fence marked the technical site of Alpha and then Beta. And how did that happen? I think we have a game that can compete cheerfully with not only the processing of an environment that is absolutely excellent (although it is a two-year-old CryEngine), but also a story that is really one of the best in the RPG games. I warn in advance that the game is not for everyone. Somebody discourages a more complex dueling system, archery on blind. The need to think in conversations and to remember your actions. The next one is not too much emphasis on reality, such as lack of sleep, that food can be rotten, and when you use it more often, you simply die. Some will miss the dragons, others discourage too little emphasis on alchemy. And finally, almost a 6-hour \"tutorial\" game :) And then there are bugs like a fading figure, a missing head, a repeating monologue with a character, and a totally awful \"riding\" model of a horse, where ABS and everything around does not work and when it works, you feel like a treadmill jumping caterpillars. Nothing to do, the game has bugs. But when I compare the first day with Skyrim, that had 50, Risen, that had 2000 and Gothic, that did not go or run for the first day, it\u0027s still a success. The game as a whole is definitely worth it. It\u0027s not a 100-game game, not ninety. But beautiful 80. The main story will take you almost over 30-40 hours and to another stories had of hours doing side-by-side tasks. And is it worth buying? Maybe I would wait for a smaller discount or a month, two to fix bigger bugs, that hurt the game. But then I would not hesitate for a minute. Not really realistic games that offer such an experience, story and they are from our little basin :) Now, excuse me, Zikmund, the redheaded fox has stolen my tin soldier again.… ",

However, the story of Henry is extremely well-realized. You are given little to hold your hand, and you must work your way through a long tutorial and some occasionally tough mechanics. But once you do, and once the game\u0027s charm hits you, you\u0027ll be hooked. There\u0027s a meat to it that is missing from a lot of games these days, and it is refreshing in scale, scope, and the rich realistic world you are given to explore. Combat is tough, but fair. Bugs are not game-breaking and I would expect a patch for the majority of them to appear in the next few weeks. This game is definitely a must buy for hardcore RPG or medieval fans, those of you waiting for technical issues to clear up, waiting for a sale is fine, but you\u0027ll still find hours of enjoyment today if you want to dive in.… ",

If you enjoy hardcore RPGs and are willing to play by this game\u0027s rules (sometimes a bit unfrair) and are willing to get over some technical issues and hilarious bugs, you are gonna have a blast, even though there is A LOT of space for the game to improve. Perhaps not the RPG of a decade, but solid game nonetheless. The pros: - The game feels absolutely unique and unlike anything you have played before, a breath of fresh air. Its overall atmosphere is simply \"magical\". It may have its quirks and flaws, but feels very refreshing. I felt flashes of Gothic 1 \u0026 2, Mafia I \u0026 II (in the way the story is being told), even a bit of Choose Your Own Adventure games. If you are on the other hand looking for the next Skyrim, this game is not for you. - A LOT of content. I was a bit surprised to see the opening credits after more than 3 hours of the game! Already long into the game, it feels like you are just scratching the surface. - Quest design is brilliant for the most part, there are multiple solutions to pretty much every quest in the game. However, it could use a bit of a reduction in the need to travel and backtrack which would speed the pace of the game up a bit. - Cutscenes are very good, both in terms of writing and animations. The story is very engaging while being very \"human\" and believable. The animations range from very good to some weird ones. The voice acting seems high-quality for the most part, could be improved in some places. - Characters (both \"main\" and \"side\" ones) are interesting. They feel natural and unforced, including the dialogues and choices you can make when interacting with them. - The combat feels really nice and fluid, but it is very complex. It can be at times extremely difficult and before you learn how to fight properly, you are gonna get your ass handed to you again and again. Again, again and again. - The world is gorgeous, but more importantly, feels VERY real. If I were to take a very long stroll through the countryside in the summer, it would look (and feel) exactly like this. The weather effects and sounds are great (especially rain and thunder). - You have to be constantly paying attention, listening to conversations and thinking things through. Reminds me of a time when games actually made \"sense\" by design. - Art style is beautiful, the game\u0027s map is probably the best I have seen in a video game to date and attention to small details both in design and art style is remarkable. - Great music, both during exploration and during cutscenes. - A few great minigames, great alchemy. The cons: - The game is in a bad place from the technical side of things at launch. Especially if you don\u0027t have a top-of-the-line PC, you may save yourself some trouble by buying it on a console, where it runs decently with the Day 1 patch installed. - Lots and lots of bugs. To be expected, but it could use more time in the oven. Perhaps some of them have to do with the use of CryEngine which wasn\u0027t made for open world RPGs of this scale. Haven\u0027t encountered any game-breaking bugs. A LOT of hilarious bugs, like occasionally being able to fly, people not noticing you in stealth even though they are staring right at you and similar. - The world feels a bit empty and lifeless despite being filled with content. In many RPGs, there is always something to do and the pace at which you explore and go about things can be quite frantic. In KC:D, the content feels much more deliberately and \"naturally\" placed and spread out. Same with NPCs. You don\u0027t feel the \"everything is happening right here and now!\" buzz. The whole pacing of the game seems slower and deliberate (the survival mechanics add to this). - The fields and forests are beautiful, but you can\u0027t do much there. Even animals are very scarce with little variety. Yes, it would not be historically accurate, but a sacrifice realism here for the sake of fun would do this game a lot of good. - When travelling through the world, you will encounter random events similar to RDR. They feel somewhat dull, repetitive and unimaginative. - The crime system can get hilarious, you can get in trouble even though you are not sure what you have done (probably have walked somewhere where you shouldn\u0027t have and someone noticed you, makes for some really unexpected and silly situations). - Combat has been designed with 1 on 1 fights in mind and it is painfully visible. - A LOT of people are gonna have serious problems with the combat and the game in general as it doesn\u0027t hold your hand in any way. I am impressed, but also a bit disappointed that they didn\u0027t hold off on the game\u0027s release, because it feels like it could really benefit from some more polishing and more effort put into the game. At this point, it is something of a gem in the rough, but I think many people will love it, I certainly do.… ",

The story itself is not terribly original, but where it shines is in the light of other games. Most RPG gamers are at a point where we are no longer excited about having to save the world for the 100th time, but here, Warhorse isn\u0027t trying to sell us on that same drawn on archetype. We are a worthless peasant, trying to make his way in the world, and in that, the game truly shines. I find myself constantly wanting to continue forward and figure out what to do next. I also replay missions in my mind and wonder \"what if I did ____ instead of _____.\" This is where the brilliance of their execution comes into play. Without a doubt, it\u0027s the most fun I\u0027ve had with a game in a long while.… ",

The bottom line is this - there\u0027s some jank, there are some bugs (but nothing game breaking or dramatic; the usual stuff we expect for new open-world releases).

In Kingdom Come: Deliverance you play as Stumpy McLad, one of the village idiots with a protruding forehead and an entitled sense of self worth. Fortunately you\u0027re grounded by your parents, who understand what a massive idiot you are and never hesitate to remind you. At least, before they die horribly after the first half of the tutorial is done (what, it isn\u0027t a spoiler - it was in the trailer!) and you need to move on to the 2nd half. A few other people have mentioned bugs/performance issues, and I have to admit I haven\u0027t had any major issues at all. The game is gorgeous, and I\u0027m running it comfortably on high with only minor fps drops which is entirely due to my ridiculously sized 4k monitor that I still regret purchasing, and a 1060 gtx card. I could probably turn the resolution down a notch and get a solid bajillion fps, but why bother? The two minor glitches I had involved jumping on a piece of terrain that you shouldn\u0027t jump on, resulting in me getting stuck. Annoying, but also solved in 30 seconds in both cases by hopping around and getting out of it. Finally, the combat. It\u0027s VERY unforgiving. I consider this a plus. I died about 10 times near the beginning before I figured out that no, you\u0027re not supposed to fight 10 fully armored men as a peasant with no armor. Sure enough later on my character brags about hitting one in the back and running off, which is exactly what I did. My minor complains would be that they should have added in smithing as another crafting skill (I know they were going for realism but they let you make potions and I\u0027m pretty sure ancient bohemians didn\u0027t have drinks that vastly improved night vision, etc), and the save point system. Bottom Line: Graphics - Beautiful Gameplay - Fun Story - Decent so far Combat - A+++ Voice Acting \u0026 Cutscene animation - ...meh. Pretty dang great game so far for a smaller, independent studio. Don\u0027t regret my purchase, and I almost never pay $60 these days for games precisely because I never feel like I got my money\u0027s worth.… ",

I never came back to the ground, and had to load an earlier save to fix the issue. The music would also cut out randomly, and the only way to fix it was to reload a save, or just quit the game and restart it. Combat is janky, and just feels like it has no weight to it. Putting an arrow into some dudes dome, only makes him flinch, and then fight me. Doing a stealth attack/kill on someone just feels odd, and seems like it was copied from a game that was made five years ago or so. Any time you talk to someone, you have a short load screen, and then have a papyrus meets comic sans style font to pick what you say. Also, if you talk to someone near a table/desk, your character will jump on top of it. Fast traveling, sometimes ends up with me naked, in the middle of the road, and with no horse. The horse also controls like it is covered in molasses. This is all after the day one patch, and I honestly feel like this game needs another 6 months to a year to iron all of this out. This **** is not acceptable, just like Skyrim/Fallout/Whatever else you want to point out as having a buggy release. Wait for it to go on sale and give it a buy. ALSO NOTE: The tutorial is about 4 to 6 hours long, so you don\u0027t even get to the meat of the game, until after the time limit on a refund.… ",

However, I was disappointed in many ways. Graphics: 6/10 It looks great on pictures, but in motion there are a lot of things that just feel wrong. Especially the transitions between animations look too goofy. The world design is pretty, but monotonous. The game consists of mostly fields and forest, while that might be realistic, it\u0027s boring after the first few looks. Not to mention that the dense vegetation can make navigating quite a chore. The performance of the game is also somewhat lacking, a few graphical bugs, weird pop in, extreme loading times. Story: 5/10 There are a lot of realistic stories out there that are really entertaining. Sadly the story is this game is only somewhat realistic and not very entertaining at all. The main character is incredibly ugly and unsympathethic. It feels downright disgusting having to play him. Most of all the story is very short, but I don\u0027t want to spoil anything. If you just focus on the story, the game is extremely short and the miniscule combat will be no hurdle to finish it. Sound: 7/10 Again they tried to have realistic sounds, but those are simply boring and unimmersive. The music is decent, but the voiceover is ok at best. Gameplay: 2/10 The gameplay should be the core of a game and yet again, like so many other games, KCD doesn\u0027t really get it right. Their failed sense of realism and all that talk about historical accuracy lead to a combat system that is little more than Skyrim + extra attack directions - so quite rudimentary. It also features a lock-on system despite being first person, which makes no sense whatsoever. Fighting more than one enemy is a huge pain. Of course the damage calculation is just a rudimentary like in every other game (basically just damage-armor), despite the game being supposed to be realistic. Ranged combat without reticle is a joke and also numerically underpowered. The AI is just about ok, but still has the typical game AI flaws. While the game seems great for exploration, it really isn\u0027t, because there is no need to explore because you can find all your equipment from defeating just a few enemies. The 16 equipment slots are a chore to deal with. Quests are for the most part rather unoriginal. The crafting is the most arbitrary thing I have ever witnessed in any game. You can sharpen your weapon, yet despite being forced to play the son of a blacksmith you can\u0027t smith a thing. On the other hand you can do alchemy and that\u0027s it for crafting. It clearly shows that the devs had no real plan on what to do with crafting, lazily implemented the alchemy system, figured everything else is too much work and left this incomplete mess. The character development is also badly realized. First of all the game features pointless stats such a charisma, which allow to do things by simply having the right number - which is the opposite of gameplay and forcing the player to just fulfill arbitrary number requirements. The system itself is an uninspired mess of your usual pointless rpg stats, despite not being anywhere near realistic. The game also adds stuff like being dirty having an effect, but after the first use of that it just becomes a chore too. Not to mention the annoying feedback for the survival elements. The game features way too many cutscenes and again forces the player to take the role of an observer, despite this thing being called a game In a sense, even Skyrim has better combat and overall gameplay, since it at least feels good and smooth to play and the systems there work well together, while KCD not only has very rudimentary systems but also didn\u0027t do a good job of making those systems work well together. Overall: 5/10 The greatest weakness of KCD is the creators obsession with realism and being unable to compromise between that and actual fun gameplay. A lot of things in this game could have been better if it wasn\u0027t for stubborn decision makers on the team. I feel sorry for all the great artists and other members of the team that had to waste their talents on such a lacking vision. It\u0027s sad to already see a lot of critics and players throwing those 10s and 90s ratings out, because the game clearly isn\u0027t that good. On the other hand it\u0027s also not that bad, like some other critics try to make it out to be. All in all this \"game\" is worth a buy if you are looking for an experience of the walking simulator kind. In terms of gameplay it is way behind any other random rpg ever. So ultimately I wouldn\u0027t recommend it all, despite the production values being decent enough to push the overall rating to a 5. It\u0027s just that a 2/10 gameplay doesn\u0027t really make the cut as a game.… ",

The reason for this is that the positive sides far outweigh the occasional bugs, in my opinion. First, the astonishing amount of love poured into world-building, you can just feel it. So many nice little details. The fresh setting: Kingdom Come is not your average fantasy RPG, it depicts a real period of European history, 1403 AD in the Kingdom of Bohemia. In my opinion, the realistic clothing, weapons, armor etc in this game has are far more interesting than the usual exaggerated fantasy counterparts. The story (so far, I haven\u0027t yet completed the game) is quite interesting, and the characters are memorable, almost on the Witcher 3 level (and much, much more memorable than Bethesda\u0027s cardboard cutouts). Most of the sidequests I encountered are great as well. The fighting system is original and requires effort to master. You need to remember that you\u0027re starting as a person barely trained in sword fighting, not as a master swordsman like Geralt. So at first the combat system feels slow and clunky. But as you progress in mastering combat together with Henry (your character), it becomes very satisfying. To conclude, I highly recommend this game to everyone who loves open-world RPGs with good stories and memorable characters, while willing to tolerate occasional bugs (which I\u0027m sure will soon be ironed out) and willing to put quite a bit of effort in mastering combat and various other gameplay mechanics.… ",

When dueling becomes your second nature, the swordplay is like art itself. I would rate this game 10/10 but because of some minor (not game breaking) bugs, it\u0027s a big fat 9!… ",

NPCs react to the player in an astonishing amount of ways based on the cleanliness of his clothes, his reputation, his standing with the local populace and quite a few quest decisions. Furthermore, to me, the combat is quite innovative - and while certainly not perfect or as polished as most AAA entries it feels weighty and satisfying. Most players will be turned off by it because it\u0027s not very well taught during the tutorial, but if you keep at it you\u0027ll discover that it\u0027s quite deep and entertaining. Most players\u0027 tutorial experience will not be quite as breathtaking as hoped, but you\u0027re meant to feel weak and underwhelming at the start of the game, that just makes improving all the better. If you enjoy a vast and deep open world RPG this is definitely for you, there are so many ways to play your character, so many chances to be a thief, an assassin, a valorous knight or even a common cutthroat. I can wholeheartedly recommend it .... the lockpicking minigame is utter **** though. ¯_(ツ)_/¯… ",

It\u0027s seriously annoying. Invisible doors, invisible people, i once died and after i spawned there were like 50 dead people around me standing up like in a **** stephen king novel. Equally as annoying are the the time the game takes to load a conversation.... it sometimes takes up to 20 seconds so i can finally speak to someone, even opening the map takes time. There are also bugs included which will make quests completely unsolvable because people just disappeared and you can\u0027t talk to them... Which wouldn\u0027t be a problem if you could just save everytime you want to so you wouldn\u0027t have to play parts from the beginning but thank god you can\u0027t do that because you can only save the game if you drink a certain potion. I get it. It\u0027s meant to be difficult but looting for 10 minutes and then getting killed and you have to loot again is just annoying and takes the fun out of the game or having to play quests again because the people just aren\u0027t there. A nice bug is also that bushes are deadly as **** because if you walk through they sometimes work like you are walking up a hill and you will break your legs if you try to climb down from them. Everyone is talking about the atmosphere but if i\u0027m walking through a city and the textures aren\u0027t loading and it looks like a **** Hundertwasser painting with just walking clothes without faces it destroys the atmosphere completely... i don\u0027t get the positive reviews. How low are the expectations nowadays that we accept all the bugs? I payed 50 bucks for the game and i expect a decent game and not a game which will be bug-free in a few months... if i\u0027m lucky. Apart from that i see the potential... But currently it\u0027s no fun playing. Update: I still kept playing... and seriously sometimes it feels like it\u0027s the best game ever but it\u0027s just incredible frustrating the times you have to do things twice or three or four times because the game is buggy... Mini Spoiler i did the main quest with the priest and got drunk and held his speech for him and what happens? Game just keeps loading and loading after that and nothing happens. I did reload an old safegame and what happens? Right the same bug again. And this is just one example stuff like that happens ALL THE **** TIME. If you enjoy doing quests over and over and over again or reloading old safegames and losing lots of equipment you will surely have a blast. All that wouldn\u0027t be such a problem if the time this game takes to load wouldn\u0027t be an eternity. It makes it much more frustrating because you either can\u0027t play because of the bugs or you are stuck looking at a loading screen.... If they would fix the bugs this game would get a 10/10 score but at this point you will probably just get the feeling of throwing your controller out of the window... Or they should just let you safe at anytime... this would at least make it a little bit less annoying... So you don\u0027t have to replay the stuff over and over again...… ",

To sum it up if you are looking for a medieval life simulator with a serviceable narrative you just found your deliverance. This game is one of its kind in what it offers.

And for people who use a controller, lock picking seems to be impossible to do. Optimization can be improved as well. Ill give the game some time, and hope for the best! I love the combat system in this game!!! I\u0027m sick and tired of easy, hit and slash RPG games where they just die in a mere 5 seconds.

The combat is really good as well, but the AI could use some improvements, specially when it comes to backpedaling. Also archery feels a bit weird. I can\u0027t give it a 10 because there are a few little bugs here and there, nothing game breaking for me: some npcs glitching, weird ground collisions on some places, just what you would expect from a game of this size, like Skyrim. No crashes for me. Some things could be improved tho, like the saving system and the performance (its not really bad but also not very good) Looking forward to see how the devs keep supporting the game and how the modding community makes it even better.… ",

I like what Warhorse are trying to achieve with the game-save methods, but perhaps they should make certain areas--like towns or friendly residences-- where you can save the game for free anytime you like). All else has really impressed me and I\u0027m genuinely excited to continue playing. I don\u0027t consider myself a \u0027gamer\u0027, so don\u0027t necessarily be thrown off by the reviews claiming Kingdom Come is only for hardcore gamers. Also, I couldn\u0027t find anyone else providing information in this regard, but the game has worked fairly well with a Steam controller so far. At this early point, in most regards, I strongly prefer KC:D to Witcher3 (knock on wood). The Witcher series always felt like a children\u0027s story with supplemental cheap sexual content and gore, and its combat was too simplistic. KC:D washes that BS clean away. And it\u0027s beautiful. Pending many more hours of gameplay I won\u0027t feel confident in pinning myself down on an exact number rating, but I\u0027m pretty sure it\u0027s in the range of 8-10 (10 only if patches fix up a lot of the bugs). So, I\u0027ll rate it 9 here for now. PS. I\u0027m running High settings with GTX1080 and Intel i7-7700K and haven\u0027t once experienced any performance issues, if you look at the specs on the ppl complaining about performance issues on Steam, they usually barely meet the min requirements...… ",

That gives you oportunity catch them on their travel and kill them for example before they kill somebody else.

It is mix of Skyrim and Witcher 2 - you improve what you are doing (e.g. lockpicking). Then you can choose perks which are powerful, but you can\u0027t choose all of them (some are better for communication with the nobles, other with peasants etc.) - Everything in this game is \"different\" and for the first try extraordinary difficult. After two tutorials and a few sword fights you realize it is easy and actually fun. The same with lockpicking or alchemy. - Archery seems to be difficult, after the bunny hunt you realize it is easy even without the crosshair - Saving is special - sometime problematic, but authors promised \"save \u0026 quick\" feature and more checkpoints. - Bugs? I encoutered a few minor. Nothing which broke the game. - Stealth system is so great! You have to try it - trying avoid (or silence) dogs, be quite in the house, have suitable clothes etc. - I love the game. And I am looking forward for updates.

This really is an excellent game with some really excellent and fun combat, a really interesting story, some realistic status effects like hunger, tiredness, dirtiness etc which make the game feel really interesting and realistic. The games cities and NPCs really do feelWhen playing this game the first thing that immediately comes to mind is just how split this game makes me feel. This really is an excellent game with some really excellent and fun combat, a really interesting story, some realistic status effects like hunger, tiredness, dirtiness etc which make the game feel really interesting and realistic. The games cities and NPCs really do feel realistic, with NPCs all feeling like they have their own tasks that they are doing irrespective of your involvement, with them going to the bar during the night, working during the day, which adds its own layers of strategy in how you tackle quests. However, all of these positives are also shadowed by some serious flaws, one of the most niggling is the games bugs and crashes. During my play through so far I have already crashed on numerous occasions. While this can be overlooked based on the quality of the game, I do feel like the games save system exacerbates this problem, as you cannot simply save whenever you like and this means that you may have to retread a large amount of terrain to get back to your last area which can be extremely frustrating. Archery is also immensely frustrating early game as the game really does make an effort to say your character has really never held a bow before. However, this was unbelievably frustrating during a mission where I had to go out hunting firing at rabbits, as you can imagine the hit boxes for the rabbits is minuscule and it really doesn\u0027t help that at the time I could handle a bow about as well as a drunk person driving. In the end I guess that the best word to describe kingdom come deliverance is exactly that: frustrating. This game, when it runs smoothly, allows you to notice some of its excellent flourishes in game design and it really does feel like this is an incredible game and better than any other game in its genre from a purely gameplay perspective. However, when it crashes, when you experience an annoying or even game breaking bug, its frustrating because it ruins an otherwise incredible game. With this said I still come away really enjoying this game and wanting to jump into it again. It really is for me still an excellent game with these flaws. If you are sitting on the fence, however, I would certainly say that this is a game that will test your tolerance, if you have played other games (such as Skyrim) and have had no problem overlooking the flaws in those games then I would wholeheartedly recommend this game as it really is right up your alley and it shows that you are willing to accept certain game breaking moments as a given in games of this nature. However, if you could not tolerate Skyrims faults or if you were just barely okay with that games bugs, then I would probably suggest giving this game a pass, as its bugs and crashes are more numerous and feel just more noticeable, meaning that this will likely feel like a bad game to you as a gamer. Overall for me, this game is still an excellent game, even if frustrating but I feel that with time (6 months or so) and numerous patches, this game will mature and be a finished vision which will be the game it really deserves to be. But because at the end of the day this review is also subjective I would give the game an 8, because it really does do a lot right when it is running smoothly, but its numerous flaws really weigh the game down and stop it from being a 9 or perfect 10 for me and this game does have all the potential of being that.… ",

That bothers me, because I can\u0027t stand hypocrisy, so I had to make an account just to address these complaints! Yes there are bugs, but from my experience they are not much worse than what you got in Skyrim or Fallout 4 on release date: 1. Crashes (I didn\u0027t have any crashes yet, but I experienced countless crashes in Skyrim and Fallout 4) 2. Invisible faces (Happened to me a few times in Kingdom Come, but it happened in Fallout 4 too). 3. Horse getting stuck on the fence with weird animations (Yes, it happened to me in every single open world game with horses - Including Witcher 3). 4. Getting stuck on the stairs (Ok, that one happened to me only in Kingdom Come and Morrowind). 5. An enemy hitting me so hard that I fly through the skies (Happens only in Bethesda\u0027s games). 6. Putting a bucket over NPC\u0027s face so I can rob them blind (Only in Bethesda\u0027s games). I could go on, but you get my point. Now, when it comes to the game itself... well the game is just brilliant! The story is great, the immersion and realism is off the scale, combat is really good once you learn how it works, minigames such as lockpicking and alchemy are actually meaningful, the whole world is connected and reacts to your choices, characters you meet are interesting and engaging,... I mean, seriously guys... if you ever wanted Morrowind but with more realism... this is the game for you. Yes, there are no dragons and magic, but in terms of design philosophy, this is what I hoped Bethesda would create after Morrowind. Oblivion was a decent game, but the streamlining nonsense such as the atrocious magical compass that tells you exactly where you need to go completely ruined exploration for me. In Kingdom Come, true exploration is back, food, hunger, tiredness, hygeene actually works the way it\u0027s supposed to work, so there is no need to mod this into the game. All those mods, like regional crime, basic needs, helm vision, etc... they are in the game by default! This is the reason why this game gets 10/10 from me! Bugs can get fixed, but you can\u0027t change the developer\u0027s design philosophy! Now true, this game won\u0027t appeal to casual gamers who just want to follow the quest arrow so they can quickly get to the next section where they can kill a bunch of stuff, but it will appeal to anyone who actually wants to experience true immersion! If there is anythning to complain about it is the save system, which can cost you a lot of time if you die. That is the only thing I don\u0027t like, but play smart, treat this game as real life, dont get into fights that you think you can\u0027t win and you should be alright. Remember, in Kingdom Come you are not the hero around which the whole world turns around - you are just a regular dude like anyone else, so be smart about your choices and stick with it!… ",

The faces look like ones from a decade ago, only more detailed. The eyes stare into nothingness at all times, making conversations extremely unengaging, though I wouldn\u0027t say that better animations would have improved anything. The writers seem to think that good writing equals medieval stylization. It does not. The story is full of boring, predictable quests. Gameplay mechanics are explained with walls of text, which is an unforgivable flaw when you design a game in 2018. The game\u0027s world works, with all it\u0027s details and actually interessting historical info, but it simply doesn\u0027t work as a game. Aiming for realism led to creating many frustrating mechanics, that make the player seek for exploits rather than immerse him in the character of Henry. Don\u0027t even get me started about combat... I was said it\u0027s going to feel good when I get a hang of it. Well, it doesn\u0027t. Now I\u0027m simply not losing, but it doesn\u0027t change the fact that I\u0027m not enjoying it. The only thing that justifies Warhorse Studios is the fact that it\u0027s their first game, though I can\u0027t like a game only because it was made by beginners. They should have made something smaller but actually playable by anyone other than medieval enthusiasts. A well designed KC:D would take 15-20 hours at most. On the upside: the world feels real and organic, like it actually belongs in it\u0027s setting, the educational values are high and it looks beautiful, considering you have a 1080Ti and din\u0027t mind playing the game in Full HD. The language version in which I had played has many grammatical and punctuation errors, but it doesn\u0027t affect my score, since most of the players will enjoy, or should I say: get through the game in English.… ",

I simply love everything so far in KDC, very long waiting was really worth it. Graphics thanks to very demanding CryEngine is one of the most beautiful I have ever seen in the games, story line, cruelty of medieval ages, decisions are all only up to you, historical context with very nice animations and for me and other Czech players is really nice to see original Czech text written by a local people. The only thing what I am missing in this game is lack of Czech dubbing, but this is just insignificant drawback I can get over with. The game is very very demanding, but in 2018 and in the future, there is going to be a new hardware what will render this game at higher framerates than today\u0027s rigs. Anyways we do not need necessarily 100 - 144 FPS in this game. I am playing at 27 - 50 FPS (i7-5820k at 4.2 GHz + GTX 1070 at ~2000 MHz) @ 3440 x 1440 Ultra/Very high settings mix with shadows on medium and shaders set to low details. Game experience with gamepad is pretty much satisfying. Sometimes this game is so brutal and you can even see here very honorless behavior, so I have very strange feelings in my mind and I even bad feelings inside my soul after playing it. I have never experienced anything similar in any games! Truly breathtaking! After DOOM (2016) this is the first game I am giving 10 / 10!… ",

The bandits start Stuttering all over the place as the screen shakes because you somehow magically glitch yourself into the impassable bushes. So you proceed to rain down strikes from atop the bushes as they literally sink into the dirt. IMMERSIVE! Then you jump of the bushes and the 5 foot fall from the top of bushes kills you. IMMERSIVE. and you start your quest back at Rattay because apparently playing for two hours straight doesn\u0027t warrant an auto save or something because it would clearly be imbalanced and you obviously need magical immersion alcohol to save your game in real life amigo. This game is just as overrated if not more so than skyrim is. Its a lackluster RPG with some good ideas but overall horrible deliverance(AAY). The Dev chewed off way more than they could chew and delivered something that is just not worthy of the hype and praise. Mount and blade warband is constantly on sale on steam and its gives the same type of game play this game gives you and then some. One last point this game isn\u0027t lesser than Modded Skyrim they aren\u0027t even in the same wave length. it is however lesser than vanilla Skyrim. It can\u0027t compete with a modless Skyrim I played vanilla skyrim for a month without modding it before realizing how garbage it was. this game has already drain any fun it had with its filler. Maybe the Dev will do it justice and fix the massive amount of bugs and issues but overall it just isn\u0027t worth the price tag right now and feels like an early access game.… ",

The game covers, as far as I know, a realistic Story. It is set in Medieval Bohemia at around 1400. If you really want to enjoy this game, then you will have to take yourself some time. In the 35 hours I have not even cleared the entire Map yet, even though it is not nearly the biggest one I\u0027ve ever seen. This is not a game you can play for an hour or so and then turn off. This can also be seen when looking at the save system. You can only save in a bed, or with so called \"Saviours Schnaps\", which is actually pretty expensive. This means, that If you die, you will lose a lot of progress. This is a game you should play for a few hours on a quiet evening, or on the weekend. I have read often that the Combat System is really crappy. Either because the controls are to difficult or enemys are too strong. But I have to disagree. Combat gets gradually easier the more you practice. But it can still be a challenge if you fight against a well armed, and trained oponnent. A fight can easily last 5 minutes. This is, because in this game you are no one man army. You are boy, a blacksmiths apprentice. Two enemys are difficult, close combat with more than two is nearly Impossible. Just as it should be with a realistic game. The combat system is based on HEMA (Real medieval techniques) but still slowed down and simplified a lot since it is still just a game. And the combat can really be fun If you are willing to Invest time to learn it. And yes, there are bugs in it. I have not encountered that many, but got one which keeps me from completing a side quest. And the german lip sync su**s. The english one is good. But I can easily forgive that. The world is just amazing. Again realistic. If your riding through a forest ontop of a horse, then your simply riding through a forest. A forest just like in the real world. Densely filled with Plants everywhere and birds chirping everywhere around you. But keep in mind that there are no enemys lurking behind every tree like in other games. You can just look around and enjoy a nice view for once. This is one of the best parts of the game for me. The immersion. People get to know you, react to how you look. For example: Going shopping. - Normal, dirty clothes: God bless you. - Full, shining plate Armor: Good day to you, sir. How can I be of help? The World changes around you by how you behave. Not only in such small things, but also regarding the quests. Things get easier or sometimes even harder because of your decisions and you just have to live with it because you cant simply quicksave. There are sometimes even different endings of a quest or at least different cutscenes because of the options you chose. And I do also love the progression system. You learn by doing. At the start you don\u0027t know how to read. (Yet again immersion here) The game does not forbid you to open the book (like other games), but the Text will look like this: \"hsTi si a nogl ettx.\" But with some practice you are slowly able to understand it: \"Tish is a logn Tetx.\", etc. You learn stuff by doing it, and with more experience you can then unlock small \"Skills\" which will help you out a little. Like new combos with weapons. Some People give this game a very bad Rating. But this game is going back to the roots of video games. Learn by yourself. Do stuff yourself. You dont know everything at the beginning, you will have to find stuff out. Try stuff out. But today, many players are just used to games where you are able to do everything straight away. This game is a step back to old games like Gothic regarding this. I think this is what some people just dont seem to understand. So far I really like the Quests too. The main quests are quite Interesting but there are not many Plot twists in it as far as I have seen it. But there are also many interesting side quests which cover Topics which were around at this time, like a witch hunt or the unhappines with the church. Untill now I have only seen 2 classical \"collect and get a reward\" quests. (MMO Grinding Style) 1. Go hunting 2. Go kill bandits at a camp (latter one is very good for diversity) But you don\u0027t find that much in the world without quests. It is very quest driven, just like the german \"GameStar\" said: \"You cant explore dozens of Caves which are filled with Skeletons and loot (Skyrim).\" It is just a realistic world. The Performance is not bad at all. I can easily run ultra settings with 60 FPS. But I do also have a good setup (I7 8700, 16 GB RAM, GeForce 1060 6GB). Conclusion: If you are open for a realistic medieval game with real topics from that time, in which you will have to Invest time to learn stuff, explore and try things out. Then this will be the game for you. There are some small flaws and glitches in it, but If you can look past these, then this can be a grand experience in a greatly designed world.… ",

The devs have promised us so much yet delivered a little more than average. Game itself has many problems like bugs that will hopefully be fixed in future, the graphics are nice but I meet half rendered textures and glitches way too often, the combat system itself is frustrating to me and whole skilling and perking doesn\u0027t help it, AI of NPCs is a joke, equipment management is awful (no comparison when buying this, small equip load, the description positioned in a bad place, stats hidden in details, no clear way of telling you what stats does it improve is it so hard to make it +3 charisma -4 stealth), your choices have 0 impact they just change a sentence or two but really you feel worthless in the game and choices often lead to the same ending, bad save system that forces you to follow main story because when you do you have auto save once you don\u0027t you can get the items or go to hell so all people who want to do some side quest may find themselves forced to load 3 quests behind because the system sux, and I almost forgot the loading that takes place after most of things you do and feels really disconnecting for an open world game I can’t really give this game a good review because I feel like I\u0027m playing alpha of some really big and magnificent title, the foundation is there and its great but that\u0027s it and deeper you go into this game the more errors, imperfections and shorts you find. The devs have already delayed the release few times, yet the game feels worse than Skyrim release. Sorry people this platform isn\u0027t really suited for writing a good structured review but I hope you get the idea behind what I wrote. TLDR\u003e If you want a medieval sandbox, are a big fan of medieval RPGs that are rare these days or are interested in the historical aspect and you aren\u0027t afraid of bugs and glitches go for it. If you are interested in the story or came expecting something like witcher 3 without magic this game isn\u0027t for you don\u0027t bother you will be disappointed. The rest of us can only wait if the devs are capable enough to fix their own bugs and I personally hope to see at least an inventory rework and some AI enhancement.… ",

The voice acting is woeful/awful in the game, the acting lacks emotion and doesn\u0027t line up with what is happening on screen. Locking picking is extremely hard, which is how it should be, and becomes an enjoyable challenge to open harder locks. The combat needs work. The concept is there but the application is lacking.

In the past 5 years for me I havent enjoyed many games as they have become very dumbed down/simplified and try far too hard to be movies. games used to do their own thing and feel very unique, and most games were ambitious maybe too much but that is 100x better than the group tested nonsense we get now. This game reminds me of how games used to be. its hard but the difficulty is natural as opposed to artificial difficulty, you will get gud as it progresses but you have to learn and adapt. You dont get better because your character eventually becomes a superhero upgraded to the max, its because the game has a natural learning curve. At first the combat seems to be **** but when you get better it really opens up and you realize its pretty damn good and probably the best sword for an open world rpg (not saying much cause witcher and elder scrolls had very meh combat). The story isnt some corny story written by sjws or another wannabe movie plotline, its realistic and does a good job at engaging you if you get into it. Your decisions have a lot of impact and you can tackle missions however you please. The graphics are impeccable but thats not saying much cause most games have amazing graphics now. The sound design is alright, the mixing and layering of the audio could be better but the voice acting is good and the sounds all sound accurate. THE CONS: BUGS BUGS BUGS it is pretty **** buggy, about as buggy as a betheseda game at launch. It isnt really any more buggy than those games were though and it isnt game ruining just annoying specially when the game is as enjoyable as this. I think it is less buggy than Witcher 3 at launch though for me, the ps4 version of that game was terrible in the beginning. The save system is also a bit **** but can be easily fixed with a unlimited save mod (google it) if it really bothers you, so its not a big issue. The npc models look really good but they can have some weird clipping issues on their clothing. The animations at times during dialogue can look quite stiff too, but it is not like that during cutscenes. While the game does look fantastic it does run really rough. I have a 8600k and a 1080 gtx and it can go below 60fps often, but it isnt a huge problem for me, it may be a big problem for others. Comparing its framerate to fallout 4 or skyrim remaster is unfair since this game has far more graphical effects and detail than those do, albeit the game should still run smoother.… ",

They have played the game for longer (critics have to get their piece in early), they are uninterested in their good standing with advertisers and are much less influenced by fashion, hype or political correctness. This a remarkable game, created by a new company. The atmosphere, the setting and the historical background are great. The realism of medieval Bohemia (and of medieval combat) the dev\u0027s have tried to achieve create an immersion that I have rarely encountered in any other game. I would given it a 10, but for a few flaws, two of which are going to be addressed in coming patches: the absence of a normal saving system (you rely on \"schnapps\" which you have to brew or buy) which doesn\u0027t add to the challenge but just to unnecessary and repetitive actions. That\u0027s going to be fixed (or you can use a simple mod that is already out there). Same for some bugs and glitches that are still there, but nothing game breaking in the 25 hours I played. Personally I would also have preferred a more accessible combat. But a lot of people disagree with me there.… ",

The combat is needlessly overly complicated and slow paced, not to mention janky at best - in fact, everything you do feels slow paced in KC:D - Even the historical accuracy is debatable, right now I suggest anyone interested just to simply hold off until this game has received some major patches that fix some the severe issues this game has, I don\u0027t need to repeat what they are; google them for yourself because they are numerous.

Also, when asking the same thing I gate 100% the same dialog, which can break immersion when misclicking in the dialog menu. gameplay: I can say it can be frustrating, especially in the beginning when I can\u0027t save as often as I would like. This game punishes you for trying foolish things, and it forces us to repeat tens of minutes again and again when we are caught off guard and our last save was god knows how long ago. BUT, once you get into it, you begin to play more carefully, you don\u0027t rush into combat if you don\u0027t have to and you begin to care for your life and HP as if it were your own. From this standpoint it is really immersive and I found myself playing this game for 10 hours straight. It can be frustrating, but also, it is quite a lot of fun, especially when you are trying to overpower stronger enemy force while being a filthy peasant :D. performance: playing on laptop with nVidia 4GB VRAM video card and 8 GB RAM with i7 processor. Everything set on high and no noticeable fps drop. general feel: I think it was worth my money, I found myself laughing quite a few times when the situations were generally funny. I was able to loot the corpses of my parents and I got to execute the executioner :D. But I did not finish the story yet, so maybe it sucks at the end, who knows. I found only two bugs so far, one when loading a game, bodies are stuck in default skeleton position for few seconds before proper positions for them are loaded, and in some dialogs, voice disappeared. Other than that, I would say a good game. general cons: Can\u0027t play female character, but that is understandable. Medieval times ant stuff.

The storytelling is amazing and I identified myself with the main protagonist, the blacksmith’s son Henry. Not only the main quest but also sidequests offer a nice variety of activities, can be solved in numerous ways and are truly rewarding and in-depth written on occasion with a good sense of humour as well. Even “radiant quests” offer an interesting variety and are not in place just to squeeze in couple more hours of gameplay. For example, in the beginning I was engaged with extensive poaching and selling meat to innkeeps for nice sums but at the game rewards you with more experience with a bow which is indeed a necessity since in the beginning you cannot hit almost anything not to say in real combat. The realism that comes with hard-to-learn combat system or survival mechanics gives one a truly rewarding experience. While I like for example TES games, cleaning up tons of dungeons and killing hundreds of enemies becomes boring and repetitive after a while (at least for me). KCD gives you a wider variety of quest activities and approaches how to solve them even without combat. At frist I was worried how all these mechanics that the developers were talking about during the making of the game would fit in together but I have to say they managed to do it and offer a very cohesive gameplay experience. Additionally, the world looks great with an incredible attention to detail. I have encountered numerous bugs and glitches, AI issues. Couple of quests somehow got broken and I was unable to finish them (thankfully, these were side quest, no major issues were encountered during the main storyline). There are plenty of graphical glitches. On the other hand, the game performed well, despite the loading screen appeared quite often in rather illogical moment (when I wash myself, start a dialogue etc.). But in the end these issues definitely did not ruin the immersive experience KCD offers. If these issues would annoy you, it is worth to wait a while before playing so the Warhorse Studios have time to polish it.… ",

It has the classic you-see-it-you-can-go-there-itiveness, you can truly do whatever you want including hunting, odd jobs, thieving, making friends, or never getting involved in combat, and the character-progression is great too. You level up by doing whatever it is you want to improve and get a perk point roughly every 4 of those levels. The economy is fun to interact with. Of course, the main issue right now is the bugs and frame-rate issues which doesn\u0027t take away from the overall experience if you have a robust PC.

It gets better anyway. So, while 10 seems very high for a game with this many flaws, it\u0027s still the most fun I\u0027v had with a single player game since Red Dead Redemption.

They add food, but you can eat this food everywhere for free, you are hungry ? Np, find first house, go inside, take food, then go sleep on to their bad. You can earn money easily, just find lone house in the middle of the plains and steal dresses from there, but I did not find where and why I should even spend this money, gear ? Np too, you can earn gear same way, just knock down lone guy in plains and take his closes, go to lone house, sleep for two days and here you are, free gear, food, money, combat is very subjective, so will say, that it\u0027s slow, most Massive combats in this game are with about 3 guys around you, also you can thrust enemy with exe and hammer... So realistic!!! Graphics is bad, it do not even have FX effects, that was implemented in gaming in 2008, no volumetric effects, no lighting effects... Textures are soap, grass is 2D, only wood looks OK, but you can just search Cryengine 3 and you will find tons of videos with Forest on Cry3... Yes, some places look nice, but very outdated, also game runs worse, than BDO and ARK:SE on ultra settings in 50vs50 PvP... Shortly graphics is poor and performance is garbage, especially for such soap visuals. About 35% of the game you will be in dialogues, so it should be a powerful part of the game... But NO! dialogues are banal, mostly idiotic and boring, NPCs will talk so many !@#$, that you did not even ask, but will say nothing useful, primary quest dialogues are also bad as hell, meaningless and boring, mostly I had feeling, that playing old cheap garbage movie. Other 50% of the game you will be on road, move from point A, to point B, to point C, to point D, to point E, to point F, to point G, to point H............. Yes, this is almost whole gameplay in this game, moving from point to point, Hello from MMORPGs from 1998 ?... Also when you are moving around, then nothing happen, absolutely nothing happen, world is empty, even in DayZ in solo you will not experience so empty world, and even world do not look good to just move and admire the scenery, still, there are some places, that look nice, but mostly world is ugly, so if you want something to happen, than better \"fastravell\", then there is more chances, that someone will attack you to finally play the game. And just 5% of the game is entire gameplay. Also intro and prologue is almost 2+ hour long, probably it\u0027s made to force player to spend more, than 2h in the game, so you will not able to refund the game, but whole intro and prologue mostly are cutscenes, that have bugs, but look ok, and infinity and boring dialogues about nothing, some useless NPC will tell you story about her whole life for about 30mins will go just on that and you can\u0027t skip it, so there are some scenes where someone is killing your family, then you for 1h will be playing walking simulator, then again dialogues about nothing... Also people talk about Realistic Armor... But who give a !@#$ about how realistic armor is if there is no content to play with... And yes, armor have interesting realization, not realistic tbh, but interesting, but game do not really give you a content to use that armor, whole gameplay ion this game is just about 2-3h from 60h of walking and talking about boring and useless and meaningless themes... So take care if you are looking to purchase it, wait for free weekend and then try it. Also it\u0027s a game 5/10 as the game, but cos of all this 10/10 from new accounts who created just one review on this source, I give it 0/10, but it\u0027s an average level game, not a !@#$, but definitely not a great. So take care, wait for patches and fixes and try it before purchasing it, cos you will not have enough time to understand what game is in 2 hours to refund it back. Sorry for my bad English.… ",

This game is a realistic (no magic) medieval adventure, which can also be defined as a hardcore first-person action rpg plus stealth. With an interesting story, historically accurate and no fantasy elements at all. Not perfect, but still what many people had been waiting for a very long time. Briefly. Pros: open-world, story (quests), character development (RPG system), aesthetics, medieval realism. Cons: save system, realism (yes, it\u0027s a game and it\u0027s not always good for it, if something is poorly realised), optimisation, glitches and bugs (must be patched). In detail. This is an open-world non-linear game (except for the main quest), which lives byitself and looks beautiful (when the textures load as they should, which not happens all the time - hope will be fixed). There is always a lot of options what to do and a good amount of interesting quests waiting for you here and there. You can do pretty much here, unless you die. And you will. So save often. The main great thing is a big amount of quests in the world. Plus random NPCs on the roads. So you should accept all the offers NPCs give you to fully experience the game. Combat system is great, it\u0027s doubtful at first and not easy to master, especially on a board, so better use a gamepad, but if you spend a little time, you will find it\u0027s pros. Still sometimes you can quite easily beat ordinary opponents one-on-one even without mastering combat, if you have some patience though. The problem is fighting at night as you can\u0027t see anything and your opponent doesn\u0027t care at all. Also about combat - assassination (especially whith dagger) is imba. It\u0027s too powerful, mainly because of AI irresponsibility and predictability. The worst thing is loading times everywhere - you have to wait for far too long just to speak to any NPC in the game, the same with loading textures, loading screens everywhere and you really have to wait for a long time. Save system is uncomfortable, mostly because of big amount of bugs and glitches, especially in some quests, also the game can crash or you can see an ethernal loading screen and have to restart with the loss of progress if you haven\u0027t saved it. Such system should be an option, not a must. RPG system is oldschool - if you do something, you master it and level up. So if you fight a lot - you\u0027re becoming a better fighter not only because of your own experience, but your hero masters it with you. The same with speaking, bartering, cooking abilities and so on. Perfect in this. If you have a high-end PC, than probably you will not face any problems, besides loading screens time and time again here and there, mid-end PCs can experience some freezes and other no-essential issues, but overall the optimisation is quite bad and low-end PC users will not have any chance to experience the game even on the lowest graphics settings. Bugs and glitches are an issue right now. Hopefully patches will fix it all. If not, it\u0027s still a very interesting and solid game even with all these problems. There are exceptions though, which can ruin the game. F.e. some quests are incomletable and you have to restart the game to avoid them, so you have to save as often as you can.… ",

I personally have experienced some real bad glitches. One in particular meant I had lost 4 hours of gameplay having to load up an old save. Annoying? Oh most certainly, but this game just beacons me back in. The story is just fantastic, not playing as the all powerful warrior crushing all who oppose you and instead playing as a humble blacksmiths son who starts of so underwhelming is so refreshing. The save system is unforgiving and takes me back to the 90’s style of FU if you die mechanics, meaning every fight and decision you make that much more important and worthwhile. Even when I fail a vital task or die because I rode ol’ pebbles off the cliffside (or just a very steep incline). It makes the player more cautious when playing which is a bonus. Ok so sure I’ve failed due to bugs or even the occasional glitch here and there.. and there also. However I just can’t hate this game. When everything is going smoothly you really can feel immersed in this game. You can try to rush through the story perhaps using your charm to talk your way through situations but good luck in a fight! On the other hand you can develop Henry into a merciless killer, taking what he pleases (along with the consequences that coincide with such actions). Either way however your play style, it’s the development of your meek character into a tried and tested survivor and then further still into a veteran of wars (if that’s how you want to play of course). I recall when my friend who was early into the game asked me “How do you save a woman about to be assaulted by heavily armed and armoured soldiers” Since he got the option to do so. I simply said “you don’t save her”. To which he replied “Why does the game give you the option”. To which my typical douche response was “because she is about to be assaulted, you don’t want that to happen do you?”, we went back and forwards for a while until he understood that while just because the game gives you the choice to try and be the hero, earlier in the game you will just end up another victim of war. This game makes you assess situations and learn from your mistakes, and that is the one of the best features of Kingdom come deliverance. I look forward to seeing how Warhorse develops this game further now they have seen how many fans this game has generated.. along with what I can only assume is a nice slice of revenue. I will be awaiting all the updates and cannot wait to see what DLC they will release... I will be waiting with my wallet in hand ready to throw all my cash monies at them. Because this game is worth every penny.… ",

But it is very broken in its current state. I have played through the entire game\u0027s main questline and had multiple problems, especially in the second half of it. There are issues with the various systems included in the game. Firstly, the quests themselves. Many are buggy and borderline broken. You\u0027re able to experience things like NPCs you\u0027re supposed to talk to having their \"talk\" option disabled, the game lingering in \"combat mode\" making it impossible for you to interact with people and continue the quest, or even having 10 enemies spawn directly around you in a corner while your weapon is unsheathed and you\u0027re supposed to be carrying someone\u0027s body out of the premises. These issues appear more and more as the game progresses. It\u0027s apparent it wasn\u0027t tested nearly enough for a final release. Then, there\u0027s the reputation system. You can kill a lone NPC located a mile away from the city and somehow the entire city becomes aware of it, decreasing your reputation with it. This is despite the fact there were no witnesses. This wouldn\u0027t be so bad if having a low reputation in a city was no big deal, but it makes questing in it borderline unplayable because NPCs will require you to pay them sums of gold just to speak to them. Imagine having to speak to multiple NPCs to complete a quest, and having them force you to pay them EVERY SINGLE TIME you speak to them. If you end the dialogue and need to talk to them again, you have to pay up once more. This can even happen with main quest givers. To make this worse, I\u0027ve had a quest falsely lower my reputation after engaging in a fist fight (which was required by a main quest\u0027s objective) and there\u0027s no easy way of raising your reputation back up (other than going to jail, which takes away 10 in-game days and applies a debuff your stats). There\u0027s a loading time every single time you speak to an NPC. Every. Single. Time. Sometimes it takes as little as 2 seconds, but it\u0027s also taken me up to 25 seconds to load a single scene. And those long ones weren\u0027t complicated scenes either, just regular nameless peasants. This killed a great part of the immersion for me and discourages you from talking to NPCs altogether. Not to mention, Oblivion, which came out nearly 12 years ago, had no loading times for dialogue with NPCs. The combat feels clunky and unresponsive. Strong opponents take forever to take down if you play the intended way, or can be ridiculously easy to drop if you cheese them. It feels very janky and unrewarding at the same time. Archery is a joke, you just can\u0027t hit anything. Even with a crosshair mod, it\u0027s awful and arrows tend to go in whatever directions they feel like. The most enjoyment I got out of this game in the end was some of the main storyline (the scene with the priest is one of the most entertaining I\u0027ve seen in a video game - it completely caught me off guard) but even that was soured by a disappointing ending. I also liked just looking around Bohemia, which is beautifully crafted for the most part. But just walking around in the open world gets boring very fast. You keep encountering the same 4-5 random events and they grow stale extremely quickly. Most of my time with the game was marked with frustration. It\u0027s clear it was rushed towards the end in order to meet the intended release date. Hopefully bugs and issues get fixed with time, but in its current state, Kingdom Come isn\u0027t worth it.… ",

It has its downsides for sure, there are some bugs as well but nothing that couldn\u0027t be fixed and it definitely isn\u0027t as bad as many people try to paint it. This game definitely isn\u0027t for casual gamers but for mature people who love a good game with some challenge, perfect story, incredible landscape, game mechanics and a superb immersive experience. This game is worth every penny and if it should help the developers to produce sequels or any other games like this one I would be willing to purchase this game even 4 times for its full price, that is how much I enjoy playing it. It is finally a game with which I am not bored a few hours in the game as is the case for me with 95% of all the current so called \"AAA\" production which is meant for casual gamers/kids who appreciate the \"click, click, click\" kind of gameplay. To debunk some of the claims in the negative reviews I\u0027ve read so far: Performance is poor I am playing the game on i7700k, 16gb ram, SSD drive and an old GTX 770 on high details 1080p and I am getting around 25-50 fps. It is good enough for me, I do not see any textures appearing out of nowhere as people say (most probably the SSD helps here). Of course the performance could be better but I honestly can\u0027t expect more from such an old card. I also believe that with some more patches it will run a tiny bit better. Given the fact that this is enough for me I haven\u0027t really played with the settings and I am sure I could improve the performance by some tweaking easily. Incomplete save system The save system isn\u0027t missing anything and is just perfect. You want to save the game and keep your groshen? Go sleep or finish/take up a quest. You are a few hours into the game and have the groshen? Buy the savior schnapps and save your game whenever you like. I really don\u0027t need the Save\u0026Exit or quick save or anything else, I honestly think it would break the immersion which is great now exactly thanks to the fact that you don\u0027t save so often so you need to be ready to run if things turn ugly. Clumsy/hard combat The combat definitely isn\u0027t a \"click, click, click, win\" type of combat and that is what I like about it. In the 30 hours of gameplay I\u0027ve died just once and it was simply because I wanted to see if I can take up a Cuman chasing me when I didn\u0027t wear absolutely any armor and held a sword in my hand literally for the first time so no wonder a seasoned marauder cut me in half with no problem at all. Honestly I\u0027d say after a few hours in the game that the combat could have been even harder since it feels to easy to me already, the only problem (lack of skills/knowledge most probably) I have with guys wielding a shield, it takes a little longer to beat them, everything else is not a problem and I can take on multiple opponents at once without being hurt. So hard combat? Really? Game breaking bugs In some 30 hours of gameplay I had to reload the game twice. Once I got stuck jumping over a fence on a horse and second time I flew up into the skies accessing alchemy table. To sum up This game isn\u0027t for kids, it isn\u0027t even rated as such, it is a game for people who can appreciate a good game and they will definitely love it.… ",

    "comments": "Desde su anuncio hace tiempo en Kickstarter, Warhorse Studio, el equipo desarrollador de Kingdom Come: Deliverance quiso hacer notar que su enfoque en el título sería el realismo. Y de mera entrada hemos notado que el empeño puesto en dicha característica resalta de gran manera, haciendo de este viaje, una experiencia increíble, pocas veces visto, y que nos castiga cuando queremos pasarnosDesde su anuncio hace tiempo en Kickstarter, Warhorse Studio, el equipo desarrollador de Kingdom Come: Deliverance quiso hacer notar que su enfoque en el título sería el realismo. Y de mera entrada hemos notado que el empeño puesto en dicha característica resalta de gran manera, haciendo de este viaje, una experiencia increíble, pocas veces visto, y que nos castiga cuando queremos pasarnos de listos. En Kingdom Come: Deliverance seremos Henry, el hijo de un herrero, estamos en el medio de una guerra civil que azota la tierra de Bohemia, Henry perderá a su familia, y las ganas de vengar a sus seres amados, le harán hacer cosas que él nunca imaginaría. Henry no está destinado a ser un héroe, pero si será todo aquello que el jugador quiera. el juego se aferra a la realidad lo más que puede, no vamos a tener 10 puntos para gastar en habilidades cada vez que subimos de nivel, no. Más bien, aquello que Henry haga, será lo que va a mejorar de él; entonces, si vamos de cacería, la habilidad con el arco de Henry subirá. O, si nos gusta mucho andar a caballo (uno de los puntos más sobrecogedores de Kingdom Come: Deliverance), entonces el cabalgar de Henry mejorará, lo mismo con las peleas con espadas; la práctica hace al maestro. Entre las distintas habilidades encontramos: alquimia, beber (si, podemos ser el alcohólico supremo), herbalismo, caza, mantenimiento (en relación a evitar que nuestros objetos no pierdan vida útil, pues con el tiempo van desmejorando), lectura, para poder leer libros u otros textos en distintos idiomas (en aquellos tiempos pocos podían leer, y Henry, al ser hijo de un herrero, no sabe leer), forzar cerraduras y por último pero no menos importante, carterista. Cuando Henry mejora en alguna de sus aptitudes, podemos desbloquear ciertas ventajas en los distintos apartados. Por ejemplo, si dedicamos a pasar los días bebiendo hasta que sea imposible caminar, Henry obtendrá más resistencia al alcohol. Cuando visitemos las áreas de práctica de peleas de espadas, o cada vez que entremos en luchas, Henry mejorará, y aprenderá nuevas combinaciones de ataques. Y así funciona con el resto de aptitudes de nuestro humilde herrero; él es como cualquier otra persona en este mundo, será mejor en aquello en lo que se esfuerce, y no tan hábido en las cosas que no suela hacer; todo depende del jugador y el tiempo que dedique en hacer de Henry un hombre capaz. Ese apego al realismo en el día a día de nuestro protagonista es fascinante y nos mete de lleno en el juego. Hay que recordar, que este no es un título donde vamos por ahí, despachando enemigos aunque vengan en grupos, si ya a veces es complicado enfrentarse a un solo enemigo, combatir contra dos o más, es sinónimo de muerte segura (al menos en las primeras 15 horas del juego), así que lo mejor en muchos casos será salir corriendo como si el mañana no fuera a venir, ya lo dice el refrán: ”mejor que digan aquí corrió, que aquí quedó”. Además de las distintas habilidades, Henry tiene que ocuparse de sus enceres personales, su ropa se desgasta, y es necesario que vayamos al sastre, o que nos hagamos con kits de reparación de ropa. Lo mismo pasa con el equipamiento (armas, cascos, escudos), que requieren mantenimiento y reparaciones constantes por el uso. Cada vez que les reparamos, sus estadísticas bajan un punto, lo bueno es que en camino siempre hallaremos la manera de conseguir dinero, honradamente, o como un pillo. Para reparar nuestras armas y demás, podemos visitar al herrero para que lo haga por nosotros, o comprar -o robar un kit de armero, que nos permite usar un martillo y alicate para hacer reparaciones pequeñas. Cabe destacar, que cuando los artículos bajan más de un 75% de su condición, estas solo pueden ser reparadas por profesionales, y los kits son inservibles. Hay más actividades extra: Nuestra espada necesita filo para ser certera, y para eso, podemos usar alguna de las afiladoras de la época que hay en cada pueblo para afilar nuestra fiel compañera. De vez en vez, Henry olerá mal, y deberá darse un baño si quiere estar presentable antes las damas que quiere cortejar; no es igual llegar sucio o lleno de sangre, que oliendo a perfumes después de un buen baño (puede ser un baño con ‘final feliz’, en aquellos tiempos -y en el juego, podías acudir a casas de baños especiales), la pinta lo es todo en una época donde andar bien vestido te hacia ganar la empatía de los demás. Kingdom Come: Deliverance ya ganó el Indie del año en mi corazón, ofrece horas y horas de juego, inmersión que nos lleva a sentir que vivimos en la misma era medieval, nos enseña sobre historia, y lo más importante: Demuestra que un equipo pequeño, independiente, y con ganas de hacer las cosas con amor, puede entregar una obra de gran calidad.

This is good, as it gives you a sense of vulnerability and makes things more intense and how you approach situations is important because the risk is greater. I recently started replaying Witcher 3 and i see they used a few of the features in KC:D that they did in that game, so it was nice having some familiar components (if it\u0027s not broke, don\u0027t fix it). The swordplay is challenging to learn, but the timing and combos are familiar if you\u0027ve played Witcher games. Cons so far would be sometimes you get forced by the main story to do something you might not want to do in a way you might not want to do it, but i think that will drop off as i get out of the initial game setting. As for game quality in the performance and graphics realm, it\u0027s been awesome, very smooth performance. I\u0027m getting average of 75fps with the graphics turned up to high/very high and LOD maxed out. I have a i7 6770k and an Nvidia gtx 1070, and everything performs very well.… ",

Here you play as Henry, the blacksmiths boy who has a taste for adventure and combat… Youre a noob to both and this game does a great job of making you feel just as such. This game is set during mideval times in the holy roman empire. Though don’t let the setting fool you, this isn’t some dorky dungeons and dragons skyrim nonsense. Just kidding I love skyrim.. but the other bit I wasn’t kidding about This game focuses on realism and is a much more compact adventure.. Think less skyrim and withcer and think more assassins creed meets for honor The world is big and beautiful like your mom… But this isn’t a world that was built to explore, it was built to look beautiful and feel real, and it does so perfectly… The revenge story here takes about 20 hours to complete but the time you put into this games world will determine your experience with this story… This game can be whatever you like.. You can go out, learn combat, plunder villiages for their food and ritches, go after the finest weapons and armors, or you can be noble and play this game with honor, only killing when you have to.. which the game does a great job of pushing you more towards this because of how difficult this game actually is to master… excluding this games final mission I probably only killed maybe 5 or 6 enemies my entire playthrough… Youre not thrown into battles or dangerous situations… you have to seek them… And seeking them isn’t all too wise, as dying in this game can mean losing hours of progress, especially if youre not sticking to the story Sleeping in a bed you own and completing quests is the only time this game autosaves.. the rest is up to you.. And the drinks that allow you to save any time youd like are rare. Though ive heard world the developers are back petaling on this decision. My experience was more of a im a naïve kid doing what I have to to get an important sword back that was taken from me.. and other things… getting into trouble planning my escape when no one would let me out of the castle…, getting drunk with a priest and then having to deliver a sermon in his place in the morning ringing some bells in the bell towers if you know what im saying, Go on a hunting trip with spoiled royalty I didn’t choose to go out into the world and become a warrior and this was fine… I wasn’t punished for this.. And playing this way made me not have to worry about this games hunger and energy mehcnaics… id fast travel to an area I know, sleep for a night and get some food from the pot in the morning and continue through the story… though this games very final story mission will definitely require you to have decent combat knowledge and gear Combat I found very frustrating at the beginning, which makes sense for your character, but slowly I got the hang of it, if attacking in different directions, timing my blacks, mixing up my stabs and slashes, I felt like I was a deadly dancer and I was… enemies that used to mean im going to die turned into, you better have a nice reward on you for me to loot for you wasting my time in this forest like you are right now. But multiple enemies will always give you trouble, again this is no skyrim.. no magic, no super powerful attacks or weapons.. its pure combat.. And as far as other gear goes you can pick it off of enemies or save up some cash to buy.. However you do have to keep your armour nice and clean, take baths everyonce in a while if you want to charm the people of this world. As how you look, smell, and act will effect how people treat you. Theres also a leveling system in the background that allows you to build up some perks like being able to carry more items.. but again realism… youll only have the necessitites on you… the rest goes to your horse to sell later… This was an overall really great experience however, I dealt with basically a game breaking bug for the majority of the game… As there was a character that wouldn’t stop following.. he would knock me out of my sleeping and waiting.. it was annoying and frustrating, I would have to get on my horse wait for him to catch up to me and ride back to a bed for example to get a little sleep to get my health back, or even to talk to npcs… as he would break those interactions as well… Easily the most annoying bug in the game, especially considering I dealt with it for 7 of this games 13 main quests… But the most heart breaking thing about this game is that its performance on the ps4 during the final mission practically makes it unplayable.. if you try to get into the mix the game stutters and your character is thrown all over the place and if you don’t have the best gear or weapons, youre really going to need luck to get through to the credits.. It’s a shame my final tastes with this game were sour… ",

It\u0027s a very packed experience with a lot to do. Overall, I am really enjoying the game, and would recommend it to anyone interested in it. Maybe hold out for a bit, if you\u0027re really not ready to deal with the bugs. Pros: - Great story so far, already a couple of major plottwists, some of which were genuinly unexpected. Henry, son of a blacksmith, is the main character and he\u0027s a very deep character, that you can emotionally attach to because the game sets the story up in a way that you will probably feel what Henry feels (I did). It keeps you hooked. - The world is historically accurate, which is a pro for me. It might sound like this historical accuracy could make everything boring, but no, the story is an epic one about revenge. - Amazing graphics, even on lower settings (I played on a combination of high/very high/ultra on a GTX 1070 at 1080p). - The world is very dense, 16 km^2 of landmarks, forests, villages, castles and activities. The area it\u0027s set in is in turmoil and chaos, and that feeling is represented very well. You will get ambushed, find burnt out houses and find scum hanging around in the taverns at night. - A living world, maybe less so in the countryside, but in villages, everybody\u0027s doing something. Working, selling stuff, guarding, whatever. No AI is sitting or standing around doing nothing. This gives villages a very lively feeling. - The RPG system is like Skyrim; the more you train a specific skill, the better you become at it. If you use your sword a lot, you become better at swordfighting. If you manage to convince lots of people through speech, that skill increases. The system is fleshed out well and works great. - There are survival elements like the need for food and sleep, there\u0027s a bleeding and injury system and you can get drunk or poisoned. These elements are very present but do not feel pushed. They feel natural and I\u0027ve never felt that these elements hindered me from progression in the game. - The armor system is very deep and advanced, and it\u0027s awesome. There\u0027s tons of layers. If you want, you can be a walking castle with full metal plate armor, but it\u0027ll make you slow and very noisy. Nice shiny armor does however impress people, which gives you an advantage when trying to intimidate or convice people. - The controls are very good (only tried mouse and keyboard). The combat system is advanced but not overwhelming, maybe a bit at first, but luckily the game provides good tutorials. You are immediately thrown against pretty good enemies though. You will probably die quite a bit at first. - There\u0027s so many little things that make the game even more immersive, such as a tresspassing system, where going in to someone\u0027s house will make them angry. Then there\u0027s a reputation system that influences price in shops, but also the way people speak to you. When you try to sell stolen goods, it might work out if it\u0027s an apple. But good luck selling a nice shiny sword in the same town you stole it in; people will know! Cons: - It\u0027s buggy. Really buggy. I\u0027ve been lucky, and I\u0027ve only had one game-breaking bug, where I could not sleep or sit. You save by sleeping and get energy by sleeping. Without energy you are useless in battle so progression was impossible. Reloaded an old save to fix it. Then there\u0027s tons of clipping issues, collider issues, animation issues and freezing. I\u0027ve not had performance issues, but the other issues still make it frustrating, even though it has never been to the point where I really wanted to stop playing. I\u0027ve never had any crashes. The game itself is still great. Right now, you can expect the bugs to be just a bit more frequent than in a Bethesda title. So honestly, if you\u0027ve played those games, you know what to expect. I\u0027ve not had as many issues as others, so again, I\u0027ve been lucky that this hasn\u0027t impacted my experience too much. - Pacing. The game has kind of an odd pacing, sometimes there\u0027s hours of action followed by an entire mission of you questioning people. It isn\u0027t terrible, but I can feel it while playing when you\u0027re ripped out of the action for a very peaceful objective, or vice versa.… ",

Now that that is out of the way, I have to say that this game has me hooked like how Morrowind had me hooked when that game came out.

Out in the wild you won\u0027t be attacked by wild animals, much like if you really went out into countryside yourself. The visuals are really well done. Again, they try to keep it realistic. The buildings, clothing, weapons and other things are based on the time period. There are even pictures on the internet showing side by sides of some of the real buildings they are modeled after. Game play is great too. I\u0027ll admit at first it\u0027s a bit clunky and cumbersome, but that\u0027s due to you being a blacksmiths son that spends his time in the bar. Riding your horse or handling your sword and bow are all very slow and awkward. The fact that you can\u0027t take on much more than a couple enemies at a time at the start a refreshing change from games like Batman or Assassin\u0027s Creed. At the beginning of the game I didn\u0027t do too well, but after practicing and leveling up my combat skills, it is very satisfying to take down an opponent after a 2-3 min battle. You really feel the effects of character progression in this game. So, yeah, this game starts off slow and unforgiving, but if you stick with it, it is extremely satisfying. I have 35 hours into it and I believe I still have a ton of content to go. It\u0027s fantastic.… ",

The game has a lot of problems and from the what I\u0027ve read/ asked myself online, the developers just don\u0027t care. here are a few of the problems without any spoilers: 1. you need to use an item to save or sleep in a bed, this is a mechanic i quite like actually but comes apart with how much the game crashes/ freezes causing you to lose (on some occasions) hours of game play. 2. Some quests are just plain broken (they wont let you talk to a character you need to) 3. Some of the controls are tricky at first and the game gives vary little tutorials 4. There is a quest in the game that ones started corrupts your other save files...yes i mean it 5. the big one here is that the developers are not answering questions and communicating with the consumer base to fix these problems, the one update I\u0027ve had during my play (patch 1.04) was suppose to fix some quest bugs but all it did for me was break some others. i really wish i didn\u0027t have to make this review as the story and idea of this game are amazing, but with so many problems and so little answers from the developers i feel i need to. This is the first game in over 2 years that i haven\u0027t got the platinum trophy for,it pains me more then most people would imagine to break that streak but unfortunately this game in its current state (patch 1.04) is just too broken to play.

The head bobbling is horrible, it makes you feel drunk by default and will give you dizziness playing the game. There is not even an option to turn it off. Mods for it doesn\u0027t fix it. Even with a perfectly optimized game that \"feature\" alone would make unplayable in the long run. Then you got constant freezes. No FPS drops, the game just halt for three or four seconds to catch a breath in the middle of nothing demanding happening, and then continues. People glitch around from time to time. In general everything looks like worse than a Bethesda v1.0 game. I would really like to continue playing, but I simply can\u0027t take it anymore. I don\u0027t recommend the game in its current state. And I would love to see it success eventually.… ",

To its benefit , the arcan arts has been excluded from this game to its benefit. The fighting system while it seems hard and intricate is actually smooth and very well done. When you are going toe to toe with someone swinging an axe at you , the back and forth clanking of weapons is the most real and intense as you can get. Your life matters, so you care about your actions and how they effect others. Dying can set you back hours. This is one of the best games I have played in a while. I am very impressed with how well everything just fits together, from not bathing and reduced charisma, to having to eat or eating too much and becoming clumsy. The skill systems work and play off each other like in real life. I am rating this game a 10 because it is a breath of something new. It’s an exciting, difficult,realistic and unashamed simulator of mideval times. If you can’t hang with that don’t play it.

Expect long cutscenes and lots of roleplaying moments where you\u0027re walking with someone for 10 minutes. This could easily bore some people I imagine, especially if you\u0027re not engaged in the story. There are plenty of things that could currently be improved through updates with this game, but it\u0027s nothing worse than other games like Fallout 4 or Skyrim had that got passes by fans and I expect them to be worked out in the coming months. The AI can be weird at times, the saving system should be changed, and more general bug fixes could be made. Overall, though. If you think you would enjoy this game, you probably will.

Being a big RPG and history fan I can confirm this game ticked most boxes on my list. Story is great. Since it is entangled in the real events of those days, it is very easy to get soaked in it as it feels so real. Acting is great, cut scenes are sometimes long, but never boring (plus you can skip them if you replaying the game). Gameplay is very good. Watching early videos about the game I was afraid I will hate fighting mechanics. All those worries disappear as soon as you start practising and improving your skills. Tried to fight first cuman for maybe twenty times each time dying quicker than the one before. An hour with Sir.Bernar and I was solo assaulting cumans camp. Every fight is breath taking as you are punished for mistakes. Sometimes you have to fight aggressively, sometimes you have to wait for your opponent to make mistakes. Each fight is original. You can defeat same NPC in two-three blows one time and spend few minutes the other. Same goes with lockpicking and any other game mechanics. It\u0027s seems very unfair in the beginning, but trust me, developers thought about everything. That is why every time you level up something, you have that proud feeling of achievement. Leveling up in this game means something. AI needs patching, but you can not ignore what WarHorse studio was aiming for. Mechanics such as NPCs get frustrated if you are trespassing and call guards, or come and check why their dogs are barking are amazing. Reputation system works great - if you are well known troublemaker some people will refuse to talk to you and traders will rise their prices etc. Graphics. Since I am playing on PS4Pro I can not expect best performance and texture does look a bit weak in some cases but overall it is a very beautiful game, especially the forest. AI of animals really needs patching. Animals should react more realisticly if you miss your shot, although, I understand why developers did that (a lot of players would complain it is to hard to hunt). Bugs. There are few. Some of them are not funny. Nevertheless, everyday I start the game I see that they are getting patched (like walking the stairs). It\u0027s a small studio and with budget they had we are lucky we got that game released at all. The team is working on sorting the remaining problems as we speak and if they had more funds I am pretty sure, they would have not released the game in such state. None game braking bugs in my experience, though. Saving system. Once again, it is a design of the game. This game is not for those who want to sit down, play for 20 min. and go do other business. This is a true RPG. You get so soaked in, that you do not even notice how time passes. Every time I start playing this game I have to put alarm on if I have something planned for that day, because believe me, it is so easy to spend 4 - 6 hours playing this masterpiece without realizing it. And if you spend that time playing the game, you will find beds to sleep, potions or game will autosave. I do appreciate the fact with the games current state, the saving system might be a bit annoying, but it will work. Just give it a time. I give a week 10 (once bugs patched) with potential to be a strong 10.… ",

So the game is pretty hard to learn and to much harder to master. this game is a masterpiece and it deserves all the support it can get, the only issues in this game is the bugs and the optimization, that is why it gets an 8/10 for me.… ",

So, this game, for being the first of a Studio that started small and was backed by its community, is 10 out of 10 but I will expect more for the sequence I believe is already in the making, Warhorse make magic in this realistic, cut the crap game, absolutely gorgeous work, you must buy.… ",

I completed around 30-40% of the game and it\u0027s unplayable due to a technical bug - basically my screen shakes like crazy whenever I move or turn camera. Plus there some other graphical glitches, clipping and performance is iffy in some locations (-3pts because I technically cannot continue without a patch) The other complaint I\u0027m having is that game feels like far from finished, more like early access or early beta version. This naturally includes various bugs and graphical glitches - and there is still quite a lot of them - tho only one mentioned in disclaimer is completely game breaking - others either have workarounds or can be ignored since they are not extremely intrusive. Some things simply just do not work - like some perks or learning of those perks or combos. Then we have combat system that severely lacks polishing - it\u0027s quite unresponsive, problematic forced target locking which makes fights one vs many very dodgy to say the least and controls of the combat could get some major improvements - in other words, idea for the combat system wasn\u0027t bad, but execution severely lacked development time. Then we have some systems that don\u0027t make much logical sense: necessity to eat is absolutely pointless, because there are free meal pots and that renders all other food obsolete. Next system that doesn\u0027t make sense is stealing - basically everything is considered stolen (except what you loot from defeated foes) regardless if there was witness or not, hell even items you take from abandoned camps are considered stolen. And the worst part is - how easily you can sell stolen items - either you sell it to \"black market\" vendor or just go to town in different region. These two systems are not immersive completely. (-2pts) Now some good things - I\u0027ll start by saying, that if not what was talked above, game would be easily 9/10 - but it\u0027s one of most rushed out and unpolished games I\u0027ve played since Skyrim? I think writing is really good, with nice humor and interesting characters. Quests for the most part are done well with more or less interesting backstory (some are crazy good and funny), with just few being real fetch. Game world is beautiful tho feels bit empty and vast at times (not a big issue, but sign of lack of development time). I like progression system which is basically practice based - as you do certain activities you gain experience for certain stats and you become better at those activities (so no silly skill points you distribute at random), there are only perks which slightly alter or extend your specific abilities and I like that a lot. Summary: it\u0027s quite good game but sadly extremely rushed to release with tons of bugs and glitches and despite fact that around 500 of them been fixed with patch 1.3, there are still game breaking stuff left (or maybe introduced in 1.3) like the one I talked about in disclaimer leaving player with nothing but waiting for the next patch. It\u0027s real shame good games are ruined by terrible state there are released in. Some people may find my verdict cruel, but sorry - paid AAA price for it and I\u0027m treating it like any other AAA release. For $60 I find such game state (with bugs making me unable to continue) completely disgusting (thus -3pts for this one alone) and now I have to wait hell knows how much longer for next patch to be able to finish the game. Also lack of polish and logic in some systems that either are so pointless that become unnecessary chore or are just annoying and intrusive for basically no reason. Also allegedly game is missing some bits (some say it\u0027s missing whole act) which most like to be released in DLC (probably paid one) or even a sequel (which is even worse) so I have to cut at least another 2pts for these. (so -5pts total). Maybe one day it\u0027ll be nice and bug free game with some quality polish, but as things stand now I strongly advise not to ruin your experience and wait with your buys. Technical state of the game is still unacceptable.… ",

RPG elements are very light, so much so that I want to say that this is NOT an RPG. Why? All quests seem to have only 1 solution (albeit more than 1 way to get the solution) and nothing seems to influence the story in any way. It feels very linear and more like an adventure game than a RPG. Character building elements are also pretty terrible. Most are just there for the sake of having a skill system to call this an RPG but if you look at the skills, they are basically backseat style stuff like \"15lbs more carrying capacity\" or \"replace x attack with y\" or \"you need less sleep\" etc. Realistic perhaps, but not much fun and didnt really add much to the game. The only crafting is gathering herbs and potion brewing. Stealing is uninteresting; just wait till clear and follow the mini game which involves either moving your mouse while pressing a button or selecting an item from a radial menu within a time limit. NPC AI is still dumb when it comes to dealing with theft so its fairly trivial as long as you take off your clothes to reduce your noise level. Overall, the RPG elements are simply not good hence why I say, this is not an RPG. Its an adventure game and a boring one at that. That said... I can tell that a lot of love went into this game. Its looks good (mostly) and plays well on my 3 year old PC and I did not get any crashes nor any game breaking bugs. There are tons of bugs, but I was always able to reload and continue as needed. Of course, the save system itself is very annoying given all the bugs but that has already been discussed enough in other posts. The quality of the historic recreation is better than any game I have played to date and I found myself enjoying the history notes and scenes more than playing the game. But... the gameplay is down right uninteresting mainly because there is little to no strategy nor character building involved. You just follow the main quest and that\u0027s it. Nothing else seems to matter and there are no super hard enemies so no point in leveling either. Combat wise, every fight was almost trivially won using quick movement rather than combo skills. I generally just sprint up to them, grapple, then stab and repeat until they are dead. Its laughably easy and it does not matter much what weapons or armor they have on. Multiple enemies means you need to thin the herd so you run until only 1 follows you (AI is very bad) then kill him and go back for the others. Everything felt like a chore in this game and I didnt really know why I was grinding levels and stealing stuff because none of that seemed to make any difference. I also didnt care about the story. The attempt to play at my emotions did not work in the least. I simply did not care about Henry in any way nor could I relate nor empathize with him. But the game does not give you anything worthwhile to do aside from following the story. If you like nicely made historic adventure games, you will like this game. But if you are looking for a deep RPG with sense of progression and character choices, this will bore you to death and you will have no motivation to turn it on. Its not my slice of cheese but I can see why some people like it.… ",

Not only does it do what it does well but it is also pretty innovative; and innovation is something the gaming industry has been lacking in.… ",

Yes, there is a steep learning curve for combat and some ridiculously hard mini-games like lock-picking and pick-pocketing, but the amazing modding group at Nexusmods.com have developed lots of mods that allow you to customize the game to suit your play style. I found early on that using the bow let me take down enemies at a distance that I couldn\u0027t beat in close combat. Even with multiple foes, I could keep backpedaling and stopping to fire as they chased me and still take them all down eventually. As a result, I became a great archer but a lousy swordsman.

In my opinion the best part of the game would be the skills and perks. I have never been so driven to train my character in every aspect just so he will be prepared for combat or able to read while investigating a murder. Without having the appropriate skills for a mission could result in it taking a different course or resulting in you having to do more work to succeed. I believe that is what fuels my ambition to keep grinding on in the game, to have the most skilled version of the character. As we all know, Kingdom Come did not have the best launch as it featured some pesky bugs...but come on people, you must admit that its pretty impressive what Warhorse Studios has created. Since the patch i have yet to run into a bug. In Summary; I love the game and i cant wait to see what Warhorse Studios has in store for us in the future.… ",

Yes,the limited available skills level up, yes, you have some modicum of control over your actions, but these are the only characteristics that make it an RPG. You cannot influence your character\u0027s morality or mindset in any meaningful way, you are a bog standard fantasy hero who exists only to further the game\u0027s weak plot, you cannot be anything more or less than this. Notice the word \"fantasy\" in the last sentence, this is at odds with any description the developers gave for this game, so it\u0027s use will be elaborated upon: none of the NPCs have the same thought process as the PC, he will make decisions that no other people in the same situation will make, they will not make these decisions because a successful outcome is very unlikely, though somehow, he will succeed again and again and again. NPCs that would realistically pay him no heed dote over him, while people he knows personally will pay little attention to his actions. If the plot of this game happened in the background while you were a character you created (even if that was limited to just picking the gender and some small back story changes), with strong economic and crafting systems to support you doing whatever profession you like while reacting to developments however you think is appropriate this would be a great game that meets its promises, but because it lacks these small changes the game is disappointing. Basically, if you like FPS games and want to try swords and shields out, this game is for you. if you like RPGs, Skyrim will give you more or less the experience this game promised, and a couple of mods can sort out the few differences, and The Witcher will give you a better version of what this game is.… ",

If you decide toKingdom Come: Deliverance begins with the fact that Indrich receives from his father, the owner of the smithy, the simplest assignment - to run to the market for coal and on the way back grab a cold beer in the inn. But only in the village the hero meets friends-dunce: they call to throw dung in the house of a local peasant for what he said about everything about the king. If you decide to do this after visiting the inn, the beer will heat up during the adventure, and Indrich will receive a scolding from his father. Bleaching can not be avoided and if the drink stays cold, then the main character will snatch for being fooled. Warhorse Studios does not accidentally open the game that way. This worldly sketch on the move makes it clear, according to the rules of the Kingdom Come. We are talking about reckless actions, decisions and responsibilities. About the world and people. About the routine and everyday things that Indrich would have to do. Mediocrity, however, should not be afraid: Deliverance manages everything, even the most common activities can easily be turned into very unexpected game situations. After all, around, dammit, a realistic Middle Ages! From Kingdom Come, and really turned out a real life simulator in Bohemia early XV century. In the prologue to the village of Ingrija, the army of the Hungarian king Sigismund attacks: the hero\u0027s parents are killed, and he himself miraculously manages to escape and take cover in the neighboring city. The introduction lasts about three hours, if you do not hurry, and all this time the developers will kindly guide you from one story clip to another. At some point, you might think that the authors will accompany the hero to the finals, but soon Indrijha is released into the open world of one, and he immediately begins to create around himself a great situation after another. Will go, say, at night to the cemetery through the forest - in the dark will fall from the hillock, hurt his legs and at the wrong time begin to fall asleep from exhaustion and hunger. Or he decides to make money in an easy way - he will get involved in fisticuffs with the ragamuffin, get his neck, but still he will win and spend all the money he has won for the doctor. Then she will call the lady on a date, but she\u0027ll blur out her stupidity, that she saw how Sigismund\u0027s people tried to rape her. Or do not blab out - decisions, as well as the choice of lines in dialogs, is always yours. Nevertheless, virtual Bohemia constantly wants to check for strength. See how the NPC will behave if you get into their house. Steal the merchant in the square and offer him the same goods. Then see the guard and with wild eyes run to the city gate. Exhausted and with an innocent look try to pay off a formidable servant pennies that remained after the victory in fisticuffs. Until now, Bohemia has held up well, although once the guard attacked me for no reason - I still did not understand what happened then. In general, Kingdom Come: Deliverance - the most powerful generator of completely insane stories about the ordinary guy from the medieval kingdom. And none of this history would have appeared without the very realism that developers are so proud of. It is clear that in this game you have to sleep and eat, otherwise it will end badly for Indrich. Still in it it is necessary to wash, because because of the dirty or bloodied clothes with the hero will talk absolutely differently - with contempt or mistrust. During those 15 hours that I spent in Kingdom Come, all this realism managed to get bored - especially chips with food and sleep. You can not just go and take the quest - you first need to buy food so that the hero does not die of hunger somewhere in the forest. And sleep will not hurt. On the other hand, in my case, the hatred for these elements quickly left. First, Indrich can learn the perk and increase the time that he can spend without sleep. And secondly, around, dammit, a realistic Middle Ages! I knew what I was signing for. And you know. Therefore, take it as an opportunity to experience a unique experience. Especially since it is so. The main thing is to get used to the most notable manifestation of realism - the combat system. All the characters in the game, including Indzhich, can beat in five directions, prick, block and kick. Stand constantly in the block does not make sense - only endurance to spend. It should be blocked at the time of an enemy strike - and put the unit in the same direction as the blow. The enemy will not come up with an answer: he will easily interrupt the chain of your attacks and poke his sword on Indrijah\u0027s face. Therefore, in Deliverance, one must naturally learn to fight: to deceive the enemy, at the last moment to change the direction of the attack. Shoot from the bow is not at all easier, since there is no crosshairs in the game, one has to aim at the eye. Any more or less efficient weapons and armor… ",

You can stun a guard, steal all his items, and he will do what? Right, or - nothing, or - will fight you with the bare hands versus your sword!!! Great realism....

But content wise the game is pretty much empty. And it should be called Kingdom Come: Riding Simulator. Virtually every quest involves riding around the country, often across half the map and back. Across a supposedly war torn country where people tell you they can\u0027t go to the next village with all the bandits on the roads. Bandit\u0027s? On which roads? After I had to take a break from playing it I can\u0027t get myself to try again and probably never will. Huge parts of the game have been rushed and while the bugs will be fixed eventually they will never repair the core game. Even the main quest line dissolves into a boring mess after the first hours. That being said if the price goes down and you are bored.. try it out. The first Elder Scrolls games where pretty bad too, so there may be hope for a good sequel if Warhorse Studios makes enough money. Just don\u0027t expect more than a medieval riding simulator with a few fights and cut scenes in between.… ",

Current state of game is worst than Early Access titles on Steam. Because bugs you encounter is game killing bugs. I know people who started new game every patch because of bugs.

Why the **** would you have to pay in game items to save a game, it\u0027s ridiculous, and the fact that the game doesn\u0027t have any auto-save option is a bad thing. I was doing a quest and i was nearly at the end of it, but i died and due to the lack of auto-save it reloaded almost at the begining of the quest, wich means that i lost 1 hour just for that!

Lock-on combat is boring, stat-based, dizzying, and broken in multi-combatant scenerios. Combat boils down to constant parry-trading and spamming attacks. Combos are pointless. Archery is an unpredictable and useless mess. Too much walking and not enough to do; underwhelming gameplay loops. Incredible graphics, probably the best I\u0027ve ever seen in an open world game Witcher III included. Great sound design, everything from birds chirping from above, wind blowing through the trees, player brushing against bushes, clanking of swords, jingle of chain armor, town ambience, and so on is all very convincing. Decent voice acting and well thought out dialog, quests are interesting and authentic. Environmental detail and historical accuracy, check. The main gameplay loops though... they\u0027re just boring. It all comes together in this mundane goopy soup of mediocracy. The lockon combat is tedious, dizzing, and not fun. Multi-combantant combat is outright broken. Combat outcomes are pretty much stat based. The only skill component of combat is this reaction time test called \"parrying\". Combos are irrelevant because any enemy your level will parry a good 50% of your attacks and the shortest combos are 3 consequtive non-parried hits. Anyone below your level will die to non-comboed attacks easily. Archery is a cluster ♥♥♥♥ of randomness. You get pretty much 1-2 arrows off before combat starts and landing them is a magic trick. Restricted save system just makes the game less fun. Outside of combat you are doing a crap-ton of walking around and nothing. There\u0027s a lot to see in the world, just nothing to do. This is a case of putting realism over gameplay and fun which is the reason anyone plays a video game. If you want a cool art gallery game, play this game, otherwise avoid.… ",

Y aunque me quedan un par de secundarias activadas, con 80h ya he terminado la historia principal. No sé si me ha encantado, disgustado o ni chicha ni limoná. El juego tiene como claros puntos fuertes unos buenos gráficos y una historia muy buena pero que no sabe culminar, dando la sensación que la cosa se acaba antes de tiempo o que está perfectamente pensado para una segunda entrega si vendía bien (como ha sido el caso). Y alguna secundaria interesante. Pero quitando eso, en todo lo demás, el juego naufraga. El combate es atroz. Vale que cuando empezamos eres un tipo que no ha cogido una espada en su puñetera vida, pero es que no va mejorando con el paso de las horas. Y a veces da la sensación que las teclas del mando no responden bien teniendo resistencia de sobra. Es curioso cómo un tipo de un campamento dejado de la mano de dios puede sernos más complicado de matar que un soldado enemigo en una misión principal. Eso sí, como demos con un soldado totalmente equipado acompañado de un segundo o tercer enemigo, nos podemos dar por jodidos. El arco nos ayudará mucho a cargarnos enemigos no tan protegidos, recomiendo siempre que sea posible empezar los combates a base de flechazos y luego con espada. La IA tampoco es que sea muy exigente, especialmente en el fragor de la batalla, ejército vs ejército, por lo que será sencilla matar flanqueando al enemigo o atacándole por detrás, ya que no ofrecerá resistencia al estar luchando con un aliado. Muchas misiones son de puro relleno, lo que nos tiene acostumbrado este maravilloso género de mundo abierto (recolecta, recadero,..). Técnicamente una basura: si reduces sombras y vegetación más o menos el rendmiento es estable en 1080p, pero tiene un problema de cargas de elementos bestial, desde texturas en edificios, caras,... algunos personajes están un par de segundos sin cabeza; bugs, personajes a los que tienes que seguiir que se quedan enganchados en vallas, árboles... suerte que pasado un minuto desaparece y va directamente a destino. Y para qué hablar de los tiempo de carga entre pantallas. En fin. Sensación agridulce. Si te gustan los juegos (bien) ambientados en siglos pasados y das más importancia a la historia que a la jugabilidad, sin duda te lo recomiendo, pero por menos de 20-25€. Si te llama la atención pero tienes otras prioridades, pillatelo dentro de varios meses, que lo pulan y baratito te lo llevas para tu biblioteca. Porque solo por la historia merece la pena hincarle el diente. Pero en mi caso, me ha desquiciado tanto lo malo (especialmente el combate), que a día de hoy a precio máximo no lo puedo recomendar.… ",

It brought something new to the market, it opened new perspectives. When I was a kid, I was dreaming of such a kind of game : an extremely realistic RPG taking place in the middle-age, in Europa. Warhorse studios made this dream come true. I think at this stage, almost everyone is aware of the kind of game this is, but I feel the need to repeat it here : beware, this is not what we got used to call RPG those last years. To me, the last Fallout, the last Bioshock or M\u0026B aren\u0027t RPGs. This is an opinion, this is not a fact. No need to develop my point, that\u0027s not the matter. But if you don\u0027t agree with this statement, you will probably not enjoy Kingdom Come Deliverance. Although very good, I don\u0027t think the critics score is extremely relevant here. Btw, this score just reminds me how badly my beloved video-game industry evolved; this media I used to put above cinema and even books. Now that it has became mainstream, ideologists decided to corrupt it. Some reviews brought KCD down on false allegations of racism, sexism and whatnot. Those reviewers gave bad marks because they felt attacked in their beliefs. Everything is political to them, everything sends a message. Realism doesn\u0027t matter, ideological propaganda does. Which is absurd when the topic aims at being as realistic and historically accurate as possible. On the other hand, I believe the user score gives a better indication on the game quality. This is a game you\u0027ll love or this is a game you\u0027ll hate. If you like RPG, if you like history, if you like the middle-age, you\u0027ll love this game. If you expect it to be a story-driven M\u0026B (sounds like an oxymoron), you\u0027ll be disappointed.… ",

Where quicksaving is not an at will thing. But can be utilized with items the player can make very early on. And which you can fairly easily produce many of them if you only take the time to learn how. Combat is challenging, but rewarding when you figure out its mechanics. Hint: Use the bow on sheep, cows, and pigs until you hit about level 5. (Do this at night so people can\u0027t blame you for it). At level 5 the wobble that Henry\u0027s aim has decreases tremendously. And from there I\u0027d recommend going poaching/hunting in the woods for money. Helps to talk to the tanners around and see what kind of skins and meat they want. Ultimately this is a game that if you\u0027re willing to learn how it works, will give you a great story, and remind you how a fresh perspective on game design can give you a great experience.… ",

There are also occasional glitches - but, being a longtime supporter of virtually everything produced by Bethesda to date, I have to admit this tiny Czech outfit has managed fewer such bugs than a major US developer with far more resources. I\u0027ve yet to encounter a game-breaking bug after about 40 hours of play (including one restart). My only real complaints are the same I have had for other AAA RPG sandbox titles: dialogue options which don\u0027t match what you\u0027re actually saying, and the odd moment of having agency removed from you because the main plotline requires Henry to say and do things most people probably wouldn\u0027t. Still, the writing quality, situations and voice acting largely smooth over such concerns. I give KC:D an unreserved 9/10. From an examination of the \"professional\" reviews for this title, it appears that the current rating of 75 is largely due to unprofessional review-bombing by people who despise the alleged and unrelated politics of the head developer, who has often taken them to task on social media for unethical journalistic practices. It\u0027s sad when \"pros\" do exactly the things they castigate actual trolls for doing in movie-audience reviews on sites like Rotten Tomatoes.… ",

KC:D is the game that I\u0027ve been waiting my entire gaming life for. Regardless of the launch issues, to me, this game is RPG perfection, in every way. At times, it can be hard. More than most games in recent history, both the player and the character needs to level up to fully appreciate the experience. There\u0027s no spoon-feeding here. There is a genuine story to discover, that\u0027s deeper and more real than most, as you, the player, learn the game\u0027s mechanics and systems. Very rarely in recent times have I felt the satisfaction from a game than i felt from this game. From the past 20 years, KC:D joins three other games that have been this enjoyable and impactful to me, personally - Morrowind, Dark Souls and Persona 5. To me, this game is perfection, and I can\u0027t wait to see what Warhorse does next. I hope it\u0027s the second and third chapters to this magnificent experience.… ",

The bugs, the game has MANY, and that caused many people to rate it badly, stop playing it, or even not buy it, they recently released the 1.5 patch, which corrects many of these errors, I played a good time with This patch and I did not encounter any problems. It is highly recommended if you like rpg, swords, single-player games, and realism. 9/10.

I will not discuss mechanics, skills, game-play, this is done by others. I do not need to compare it to some big players in RPG genre as crowds already did. This is simply different, unique, and for its uniqueness it will definitely expand the boundaries of whole industry. It deserves attention (and big success in terms of incomes) as this is moving industry somewhere… Believe me, this will silently push the sensual story-lines, screenplays, and credibility of all open world games - simply as people who tried it and experienced it will demand it again as they will miss these new feelings… And people who creates video-games will try to deliver similar experience to avoid endless and trillionth copy of sandbox where you are repeating the same stuff with only different backgrounds on and on - without any sense, but of course – like complete, total and brutal superhero. And I do not give a damn my text above is full of cliche crap and it is admiring, not criticizing and not showing any details about the Game.

Kingdom Come first began as an idea led by Daniel Vavra in 2009 who decided to leave 2K to pursue his project. It was not until 2014 that Warhorse Studios decided to start a campaign on Kickstarter with only ten percent (£300,000) of what they were originally were asking for from investors, just to prove that there was an audience for this type of game and people were willing to buy it. Within a month the obtained £1,106,371 in funding and even after the Kickstarter, people were still providing donations to their website. By the end of 2014 he was able to launch the public alpha version of the game with roughly 40,000 people supporting the project. The game had finally taken its stride in development with all of its support and was able to release on February 2018. Kingdom Come is primarily classified as a role-playing game but can be categorized into many other genres due to the nature of its game mechanics and its freedom to give player’s the choice to tackle situations in numerous different ways. The game incorporates a much more difficult combat system than most typical RPG’s. You choose which direction to attack with your sword on a radial crosshair which includes a multitude of different combo sets that can be learned which then may be combined with both different angled attacks and different strikes to maximize lethality. Although daunting at first, you are expected as a player to pick up on the complexity of the combat quite fast if you expect to be even a proficient fighter. The NPCs are all programmed to do anything to preserve their life. Their strikes becomes much more sporadic and aggressive towards the end of their life to ensure you do not get too comfortable during any engagement. Although, what is even more entertaining is the fact that the characters will even try to talk their way out of death. The game incorporates a large amount of real-time strategy not only from its combat but also the heavy amount of item/stat management and decision-making system implemented throughout almost all activities. You must manage sleep, hunger, hygiene along with character relationships. The open world has numerous side quests and important historical figures that you can choose to interact with, including the ability to really help or hurt anyone you want. No longer will you be stuck helping someone you don’t want to help because the game allows any NPC, the ability to die or react completely differently based on the character’s choices (whether it be you were caught stealing from one of their servants or publicly denouncing them, they can either refuse any interaction with you or even have you hunted/wanted in the event that you really chose to do them wrong). What really makes the decision making more critical though, is due to the save mechanic incorporated into the game. In the game you are only allowed to save by sleeping or drinking these expensive potions that you can find throughout the world. This really adds to the fear of dying or making any mistake during quests because many decisions can be quite game changing as towns and castles can go from having you as a sword for hire to having you thrown into jail or publicly shamed. The game gives you many difficult situations and quick-thinking moments, but leaves you with some of the long heavy punishments if something is done wrong. It was quite refreshing to have a game that just felt so authentic and real, since I was now playing a character whom I’ve developed a personality around but also carrying mistakes that I must now live with. Kingdom Come can fits many genres but may be strongly considered an action/adventure and with heavy realistic role-playing game elements making it the closest game to an engaging medieval simulator we have. From the beginning of this game you learn early on that you are very much just any other citizen of Bohemia given the role as a blacksmith’s son, with no combat experience, no powers, or even the ability to read. You must make choices early on to determine the skills you want to focus on as to become sufficient in a world that won’t hold your hand. The game emphasizes the importance of decisions made throughout the game with no quick save function. The focus on realism through both mechanics and historical accuracy truly disguises itself well as quite the educational game through its layers of entertainment. The game may be deemed as a form of edutainment through its emphasis on managing numerous aspects of the character you play. You must make choices and sacrifices in efforts to mitigate disadvantages that you may deem more inflicting on your playstyle. Overall, Kingdom Come: Deliverance truly serves as one of the closest games to a medieval simulator we have.… ",

Game crashing, quest breaking bugs. They occurred frequently but in my play through began to pile up towards the end of the game where the quests were getting a little convoluted compared to the standard fetch quests that were the stock quest. Quests failing seconds after receiving them for no apparent reason led to much time spent replaying things that I had already done. Yay limited save game mechanic. The few mods that are out there try hard but at several points had to remove them all to progress as would often get caught in an infinite loading screen. Had to remove mods, play to get back to that point praying for the best... Not a good time. WTF moments - Cloister quests and their omnipotent mind reading guards. Such a bore. Ending was quite underwhelming. Invincible characters are silly. Especially when they are on my side. But nothing beats the epilogie for pure WTF. It went... forever?

You\u0027ll have to practice for a hour or two at the range or via hunting just to become DECENT at it. If you want to become decent at anything in this game you better practice. Even horse riding. Yes, really. (to a smaller degree.) There was one **** of a knight who I had to fight as part of a main quest. Everyone seems to hate fighting the guy and resort to shooting him in the face to down him. Nay, not me! I sat in the practice ring to hone my skills for an hour. I saved up silver rings and goblets from killing bandits to buy a mid-high tier duelist longsword. I decked myself in full platemail I found on my dead enimies that dared to face me. I visited the local castle town to fix all of my gear. I haggled all of the merchants for a good price. Since my character looks like a knight his charisma gets boosted. Finally the day came where I met the bastard knight and where the fight was to take place (underneith a weeping willow at dusk on the edge of town) We exchanged some words then the fight began. It was the longest fight I ever had in the game thus far. We where nearly equal in skill. We fought so long that night fell opon the feild. Both of us bloodied and battered and breathing heavily from our injuries. Finally after nearly 15 minutes of exchanging blows the bastart night (in his exhaustion) made his last mistake and took a blow to his head to witch he callasps to his knees. I wanted to drive my blade straight into his heart but, decided to let him live. This game is full of these moments. But not all is well in christendom. there are many bugs. Some are very bad such as loading forever. Saving is few and far inbetween. You can purchase saves in the form of a special alcohol that is expensive. Plus once you use it you are drunk and wobbly. Almost impossible for an archer character. Alternatively you could go to sleep to save but you can\u0027t just sleep in any bed. You\u0027ll have to go to a local inn ans purchase a room or sleep at a friends house. The saving system in this game is terrible frankly and when you are punished this badly because of glitches it\u0027s just pure **** honestly. THE GOOD: *Garaphics are great. *Mostly historically accurate (even the combat) *Combat (while doesnt look impressive in videos) is actually great fun to play. *The story *immursion THE BAD: *Glitches Galor *Lockpicking is too difficult *Some of the voice acting is bad.

Was für mich ein großer Kritikpunkt ist, sind die Büsche und der Regen bei Nacht, wenn man keine Fackel am Start hat. Man sieht einfach gar nichts, oder wird durch einen Busch vom Sattel gestoßen. Man kann Büsche nicht überwinden, was meist sehr nervig ist. Das ist aber nur Kleinkram.

You know the bugs are overwhelming in a game when the moment you get slightly stuck on a quest the first thing that pops in your mind is, \"Is this a bug or am I doing something wrong?\" and that can be a HUGE buzzkill when you are trying to enjoy the game and boy oh boy will you find yourself asking that A LOT. It reminded me of Skyrim at launch. Games like these are really best to play 2 years after launch as you not only will save some money but you the bugs are worked out. I hate people giving the excuse of a large RPG game like this is bound to have bugs. Yeah, no sh!t. That is considered but this game goes beyond average (as did Skyrim) and I point to The Witcher 3 as exhibit A . A game with a map just as big as this one with 1/10 of the amount of bugs. IMO the game feels rushed and although it is quite immersive it still feels a bit restrictive as there are a number of items that in most games of this caliber you would be able to take such as an ax leaning in a barn or some other tool on the table and you cannot. I also wish you could play in 3rd person but that is just a nitpick. Also noticed terrible lip sync in the cut scenes although I really did enjoy them and the acting. I also wish they varied the character face design a bit more and most people looked the same. All in all, it is a fun game and I could have easily rated it an 8 if only the bugs were not so bad. If you can get this game for half price of release price it may be worth it but I know if I paid full price for what is essentially a beta release I would have been highly upset.

Kingdom Come: Deliverance needs to be fixed from all of these bugs and glitches and added a new save system. extremly realistic i would say with a food, rest and injury system. and the combat feels satisfying but a bit clunky. Great game, hope they fix the bugs and so on and they could have a 10 on their hands Update: this game is still missing alot of features and is a drag to play again. My rating for this game has went down, and i\u0027t will probably not go up.… ",

This game transposes you to the medieval era, it does not have super heroes, it does not have magic shenanigans, you fight with your light/heavy armor on, with your sword and optionally a shield, or with your bow. It is as realistic as it gets, the only magical/mystical elements are only through the eyes and superstitions of some of the characters, and they are presented very humorously with always pointing out the real/rational explanation for them. It also catches the religious fanaticism which used to govern that era, even your own character has a great fear of God. The landscapes, the villages, the castles are very authentic to the era and the location where the action happens. Also there is a big dose of unexpectedly good humor in it, many of the quests are absolutely hilarious, they made me laugh my ar$e of. The combat system is very ingenious, the combos , the ripostes, the feints, the perfect blocks are all great and not so easy to master, you must do any of them at the right time when you see an opening in the adversary\u0027s defenses or when you create an opening, it\u0027s definitely not a spamming mess, it actually requires practice to be good at it. When outnumbered the fight becomes extremely hard even when you have all the expensive armors and weapons, especially if the adversaries are also well armed; you never become the unbeatable beast you see in other games, which only adds to the realism. Also the enemies will chase you to the end of the world if you don\u0027t get to ride your horse and run if in trouble, they can also dismount you and kill you if you don\u0027t put some distance in time. But nothing stops you from going more stealthy, what you wear actually makes you either more stealthy or more resilient to damage through heavy armor but more noisy and visible. Keep in mind that all/most NPC\u0027s sleep at night. The perks system is also cool, and I did not find any of them to make you really OP, which is really nice. At the start of the game prepare to be beaten a lot , you only become more badass at fighting after one of the main quests. Many people complain about bugs, I only encountered a few, and only one if I recall correctly which prevented me from finishing a quest, and required a reload of an older save. This is another quality of the game, it does not limit you with anything, you can finish most quests in more than one way, so if one is buggy, you can go for another way to do it, but as I said this was only the case like once. Also the alchemy system, the lockpicking, the pickpocketing, re-sharpening your swords by hand after they get blunt, all are let\u0027s call them mini-games, and all add to the charm of the game, this game does not hold your hand with anything, you must earn everything and you s**k at everything in the beginning. You really start as an ordinary peasant which cannot even read, you must progress to become better and better at everything, you must actually earn the respect of the other characters in the game by hard work, by continuously improving yourself, to become a noble. In conclusion, I really recommend it, it is a very good deal with lots and lots of entertaining hours for a more than reasonable amount of your bucks. Cheers… ",

Kingdom Come supports an incredibly well-versed, immersive medieval Europe atmosphere with plenty to do outside of main story quests. The \"romance\" arc is shoddy and hastily put together, as if the developers rushed to implement it and it is not the least bit fulfilling in any way. However, if you do not care for this, then this point is obviously moot. One of the biggest issues I have with this game is the saving system and combat. Firstly, let\u0027s tackle saving. The game only deigns to allow saving when you sleep, after certain story events, and when you drink a special \"saviour schnapps.\" The issue is that the game is riddled with it\u0027s fair share of bugs and glitches- some of which can prove to be quite fatal. I\u0027ve lost progress more than once after taking a soft hop off a small hill and the game\u0027s gravity launches me into the air like a rocket ship. This causes the player to potentially lose hours of progress for no fault of their own, which I definitely do not like. I would have appreciated an option to just have a normal save system rather than being gang-pressed into theirs. The other issue is their God-awful lock on camera system in combat. This clunky camera system forces you to focus on one person at a time- which would have been fine if the game was composed of only one on one duels. (which it\u0027s not.) It is a gigantic pain fighting multiple enemies because of this and I sincerely hope they re-work this in any future games they produce. Overall, the game is fantastic for those interested in the time-period and are willing to endure some missteps by the developer. +EDIT: I just finished the game and the ending is pretty atrocious. I have docked the original score I gave by 2 points to reflect this. I now recommend prospective players to torrent the game and play it- if you do indeed like the game, even after the ending, then buy it on Steam. Just get ready to shell out some more cash for the ending DLC.… ",

I imagined having to face actual real life problems, like sleeping, eating, bandaging wounds, brewing potions, hard combat. And mostly, this game delivers it all to perfection, but at a cost. Turns out doing realistic things in a videogame is a double-edged sword. The combat is extremely boring and clunky at first, barely being able to fight a single person with my sword makes for a very annoying and long fight. I would constantly break my lockpicks when trying to steal something, I would always get caught when trying to pickpocket someone, I would always fail when brewing a potion, I couldn\u0027t hit a single arrow shot, I would immediately die when trying to kill a guard. Simply said, realism is not fun. However, the more you progress and the more you get accustomed to the combat and the hundreds of mechanics this game has in store for you, the better you become. Just like in real life. And that\u0027s where the real genius of this game lies. After about ten hours, I could easily beat my opponent in a one on one, but if there were two guards on me I stood no chance. 25 hours later I\u0027m smacking three enemies around like they\u0027re nothing. A \"true RPG\", where you actually get better as you progress because of real life and in-game experience. The RPG elements are fully fleshed out, experience points, item management, ability points, combos, stats, and gear (there are at least 10 different types of gear your character can wear at the same time, ranging from rings to helmets, each impacting things like Attack Power or Weight). This also is accompanied by an epic story based on real history, about a poor swordsmith\u0027s son who fights his way to the top. Voice acting is superb, graphics look amazing, soundtrack is epic. The developers of this game are also very friendly, promising to release future free content. If you want to scratch that RPG itch, this is the game that will satisfy that need. With over 100 hours of content, you really can\u0027t go wrong buying Kingdom Come Deliverance. Stick with it and you will find your money\u0027s worth.… ",

It doesn\u0027t rear it\u0027s head until a bit of the ways in the game. Blah blah, you go through Combat training with a guard captain, and he teaches you the rope, and all seems well. Then you get into a real fight with simple bandits who can block, parry and dodge like veteran knights, when suddenly everything that you were taught becomes useless, like sending misleading signals when you go to swing. Aim left, hold swing, move right, land hit, so simple, right? That goes out the window when you run into the aforementioned bandits who will see this coming before you do, dodge or block, and strike. This isn\u0027t to mention that even for a blacksmith\u0027s son, your character has so little stamina it\u0027s insane. I can run for longer without getting winded than this potato can swing his sword, and I have **** Asthma. God forbid you have to fight 2 people at once, the walking pile of crap that is the targeting system is useless. I actually nailed someone with a thrust, and tried to swing at them when they back was turned, and I actually watched his model freak out and instantly transition back to blocking my angle of attack. I got into a parry match with one bandit in a subsequent attempt that went something like this. I parry \u003e Attack from a low angle \u003e Parried \u003e I parry again \u003e attack from different angle \u003e Parried \u003e I parry one last time \u003e Attack from another angle \u003e Parried and get half my health removed because he kept dodging and parrying like a knight, not to mention your sword, even if you steal from the executioner, is so piss weak even against people in quilted armor and pots for helmets, you deal barely any damage. Regardless of whatever it\u0027s fans say, there is simply no technique to KCD\u0027s gameplay or combet. You know what finally got me through a fight I was having trouble with? Swinging my sword while violently moving my mouse around, and even then they still managed to parry half my attacks and dodge the other half.… ",

I\u0027m inclined to give it a 7, except that it does something I\u0027ve never seen another game approach--it paints a reasonably accurate picture of mediaeval society, at least by gaming standards. The ignorance, the naivety, the holier-than-thou privileged nobility, the decadent Christianity--all of it plays some role in this game, which is really original and refreshing considering the cartoon middle ages we usually get in games. The creative direction is consistent and uncompromising. The tragedies it portrays arise naturally and don\u0027t feel too contrived. It\u0027s wonderful.... but... Yeah, there are problems too. Lots of them. I\u0027m a software engineer. I know it\u0027s hard to make software and I rarely complain about bugs, but there are lots here. Keeping this game running is a challenge. Unlike any other gog game I own, it got infected with viruses three times and I had to download it again and reinstall it. When I first bought it, it would usually become unresponsive on launch. Once it launched with k+m responsiveness it would be okay, but that was only 10% of all launches. That means it would usually take half an hour to *start* a playing process. Even after that was patched up, the other stuff was hit or miss. I could never tell if a quest was intrinsically hard or I\u0027d hit a bug. I\u0027d \"save\" a young noble from bandits, while we were still surrounded by them. I\u0027d get stuck in the bushes with the nearest save being hours in the past. I\u0027d confront a character about something and he\u0027d apologize for trying to poison me... even though he hadn\u0027t. I\u0027d try to steal something from a house that certainly wasn\u0027t there. I\u0027d deliberately try to avoid collecting certain quest items before the quest began, because the game wouldn\u0027t recognize those things after the quest start. I\u0027m sure there are other things I\u0027m forgetting. There\u0027s also a lack of balance. Most of the game is spent wandering around and getting attacked by bandits. Imagine bits and pieces of engaging story separated by periods of monotony that were a bit too long. I found myself forgetting what was going on. This balance is worse on the second iteration on hardcore mode when there is no fast travel. (I went through the game twice.) The other problem is that the quest mechanics can be a bit too hard. (Minor spoilers here.) The second time I finished the game I started googling the solutions to some of the quests I hadn\u0027t finished the first time around. I rarely google, but there was no way around it with the difficulty of some things. However, it turned out that my ideas were right all along, but I just hadn\u0027t gotten the mechanics right. I was shooting at the trunk of the \"topping out\" and not the ribbons. I assumed that the forbidden book cabinet was like every other container and not a place where you have to search for interactive objects. I wasted hours trying to do those quests before the internet confirmed my suspicions and held my hand the last 10% of the way! I said *hours* Warhorse! I know your testers got used to interacting with your world a certain way but what is obvious to you may not be obvious to typical users--and I\u0027m an advanced user of software. I make and use software for a living. Even if it\u0027s completely unintuitive I can usually guess my way around its flaws and keep going, but it was a lost cause with that tree ribbon. How the hell was I supposed to know an arrow would get it down? For a while I even tried jumping towards it or trying to fetch a halberd and thrust it down. I enjoyed the survivalism. The combat was pleasantly difficult. I liked the fact that your armor gets damaged and has to be replaced. I liked reading. I liked the fact that the Cumans speak Hungarian and that they\u0027re not \"evil\" but rather there by an accident of history. I liked the Christianity--the middle ages were very religious. I liked the architecture of mediaeval Bohemia--which was very realistic. But I did not like having to leave birds\u0027 cages in specific spots on a hill somewhere. I mean, those spots were extremely specific--Henry will only drop them on the right pixel. There are broader flaws too. Henry can be too many things--a thief and a noble. The more in-depth quests have too little C\u0026C and there are too few of them. Most NPCs are so dull they belong in a Pagliarulo game--they\u0027re essentially interfaces in human shape. Still, I\u0027d say the game is a success and it should influence others. I want to see more of this kind of game and less of the sort that tries to be everything and please everyone so that it can fit a \"broad\" and riskless business model. I don\u0027t want riskless trash. I want unity in creative direction. I want characters. I want convincing societies and with convincing social norms. KCD does those things.… ",

Requiere de cierto aprendizaje y de cierta destreza, aprendizaje que nos muestran en las primeras horas de juego pero durante toda nuestra aventura, iremos aprendido más y más. Es un título que en principio es algo difícil, hay que adquirir cierta práctica como comento más arriba, no es como un The Elder Scroll que prácticamente desde el comienzo puedes ir dando espadazos a diestro y siniestro. Esto es más bien como un Dark Souls, al principio tendrás que ir con pies de plomo, ya que cualquier fallo en combate podría costarte la vida. Un videojuego épico en todos sus aspectos, realista, bien hecho, cuidado y mimado hasta el último detalle, poniendo el máximo realismo posible en la mayoría de sus apartados. Largo y difícil, que sabe recompensar al jugador de manera muy eficiente.… ",

Fun, challenging, rewarding, and innovative combat, combined with a (surprisingly) mostly historically accurate setting. The only criticism I can make of it is that, unfortunately, the game still suffers from some bugs, and the DLC have, while good, been very brief for their price point.",

Then move on to other things like spotting clues to locate the quest objectives whereabouts and then the objective itself. You will also need to consult the codex frequently before you command adequate mastery of the game mechanics and rely less on the compendium. The side missions are incorporated within the main story seamlessly, in contrast to the recent trend of including side quests as an afterthought just to make players spend more time playing the game. You will find great little plots and small mysteries to enjoy as well as the overarching story if you keep a balanced diet of completing main and side quests. Kingdom Come is a non-compromising RPG which will keep you on your toes all the time and will punish you if you lose focus, at the same time it offers a relaxing pace and stints of tranquility as an inseparable part of its setting. In short, it\u0027s an RPG for RPG lovers.… ",

Every thing about the is unique and fun. The combat is tense and complex, but at the same time it is exiting and once you win you feel the satisfaction of having defeated yet another foe. The scenery is beautiful and interactive, anywhere you go you can find a house to rob or you can murder a family, to each his own, you can also get ambushed by bandits or be challenged to a duel. The game is realistic as you need to sleep and eat and though it may seem complicated it is quite simple to grasp the concept. The story is always fun no matter what, whether it\u0027s a simple quest like getting some coal or wether it is more important like storming a castle, the story never ceases to amaze. Not to mention the game is very long and even after having completed the story there so much more left to do in the world, the side quests are endless. Getting new loot is always exiting and looking good will always make you feel like an actual night in the medieval era. Sure there may be bugs here and there but they are rarely major and most of the time they are funny. In conclusion I highly recommend this game to everyone with a pc and time on their hands, the game is fun and one of a kind. This game is a must to anyone fond of or interested in the medieval era. 10/10… ",

I wanted to buy a game for this Christmas, I almost bought Assassins Creed Odyssey, but watching reviews on Youtube abut the assassins game, I ended up ditching the idea of buying it and at the end bought KC:D without knowing in much detail what I would get. Thanks god I bought KC:D instead of assassins fuking wank balls, 60 Hours played in the first 5 days of buying it. 15 hours the first day. That\u0027s all I have to say. See the rest for yourselves, buy it, play it, thank me later.… ",

This game will be long-remembered as a genre-changer - a game so significant in its impact that developers will be referring to it ten years down the road as a gold standard in RPG development. First, the game is designed as historical fiction. The locations were taken from history, the characters were taken from history, the events were taken from history. Heck, people are even using Google maps to go to Bohemia and view (and comment on) the real world locations that are in this game. You just happen to be a minor character caught up in much greater events - which works well in an open-world setting. Decide you want to go exploring in the wake of an invading army? Get ready to get pounded on by bandits or deserters. Stay close to cities and villages? The experience can be relatively benign. The historical fiction aspect works great because the development team is able to populate the world with real world architecture, materials and characters. I have never played a game where a castle looked and FELT like a real castle before. Weather systems are real. Lighting is atmospheric - and rooms at night are lit darkly by candles. You have to be aware of day/night cycles, food and sleeping - not in an obtrusive way, but in a natural way that adds to the depth of the experience. Go 6 days without wiping off grime after numerous battles? People will respond appropriately - \"good Lord man! What happened to you?!\" Carry around an un-refrigerated side of bacon for a week and decide to have it for lunch? You\u0027re going to get sick. And within this \"real\" world setting, the combat system comes closest to a real representation of what it might actually have been like to fight in those days. At the beginning of the game, running around as a peasant, you will need to avoid engaging an armored foe - because they will kick your butt. If your idea of RPG combat is bashing buttons as quickly as possible, you will fail miserably. Instead the combat system has to be learned and mastered over time. Having finished the game (at least to the point the story arch takes you in the first game) I can confidently engage TWO opponents at the same time... as long as I am smart and am moving constantly to keep the two opponents from surrounding me. Three or more means guaranteed death - and that is probably as it should be. If I need to take out a camp of six enemies, I have to do so very carefully. But the game allows freedom of action for me to accomplish this many ways that don\u0027t involve rushing in with a battle axe and flailing around. I can sneak into camp at night and kill the sentries with a dagger. I can snipe from the woods with a bow... and run away if discovered. I can poison their wine or food. I can wait until night when they are asleep so that half the camp has to defend themselves without the benefit of armor. I can ride through camp on a war horse with a lance and hope for a lucky kill. And so forth. Some combat against difficult opponents can take several minutes - for a SINGLE opponent. And this isn\u0027t a boss battle - it is simply against a veteran combatant with good armor. You learn to recognize what gear an enemy has on - by sight - and switch weapons accordingly. Wearing an open helm? You are going to jab for his face. Two-handed sword? You are going to use a warhammer, get in close for a grapple, and knee him. This also works best if you can trap him in a corner or against a tree so he can\u0027t backpedal. Shields work really well for slamming in the neck under the chin. People start the game screaming at the combat because it is so unforgiving... and they finish the game cheering the system as one of the best and more interesting systems ever developed because they figure it out... and because even when you get GOOD at it, combat is still never a guaranteed thing if you make some stupid mistakes. The game has some jankiness and quirks, but I didn\u0027t experience a single technical bug - not a crash, not an error, nothing. Most of the issues seem to be with game geometry and getting caught up or falling into locations that are difficult to extract yourself from. These were uncommon, but they did occur. Occasionally I would be riding my armored warhorse across a field and be brought to a grinding halt by running into a bush. Could it be perfected? Definitely. But given the vast majority of things this game does right, a little collision detection issue isn\u0027t going to have me running for the exit. I could go on and on. This game is designed to be enjoyed slowly like a good book. If you want Fortnite instant action you aren\u0027t going to like it. If you enjoy good story, character development, and open-ended worlds that reward smart gameplay... you will wonder what too you so long.… ",

The only problem I have experienced is getting stuck in an area and cannot move. Simply fast traveling seems to resolve it. The map looks big but travel time manually back to where I was doesn\u0027t take too long. I enjoy the horse ride through the countryside. I grew up in a farming community, and I feel they did pretty good on the details. I have no complaints so far. This looks like an up-and-coming company and game. Game mechanics are hard to get used to but like anything else, practice...practice...practice... I think they came up with a good idea to base fighting movements on reactions, timing, stamina, and health. Makes fighting give that small fear factor to aid you in reacting. Almost a year later, this game is still my favorite. With 300+ hours of gameplay, I cannot get enough of the environment. I played through quickly the first time and wished I had taken the time to enjoy the journey instead of the end game. I have tried adding some of the Nexus mods to tweak some of the things that annoy me (like the animation of bending down to pick herbs) but got carried away with some of the mods that just made the game different from the original. I chose to start the game again after the latest DLC (Yes, I WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT WARHORSE STUDIOS) and play the game with only a couple mods with the intent of taking my time to enjoy the journey this time. I so much love the game mechanics and not to mention the breathtaking simplicity and beauty of the countryside. The game has won BEST GAME EVER award for me. WARHORSE STUDIOS: Please make more games like this! + Using historical places (that can still be seen today) along with the storyline. *BTW* I hate history! + Fantasy of role-playing as an underdog and likable character with choices of integrity, emotion, and open world adventure - especially avoiding time-sensitive events. + Story including family and connecting with a cause of family honor, friendships, loyalty, and a sense of character development. Starting as a pauper or an incredible backstory of the player\u0027s history (like the twist in Henri\u0027s birthright). + Simplicity and realism + Open world + Modding for new storylines, community add-ins, and story enhancing DLC There will always be a sentimental connection to this game. Keep up the great work Warhorse Studios! I\u0027m looking forward to what comes next with your game studio! Wishing you the best of luck!… ",

None of that really takes away from the game, it just takes some work and getting used to but just when you think you have the combat system just worked out, you\u0027re bugged to insanity. If that\u0027s what I wanted out of life, I\u0027d ask my wife to let me know everything I have ever gotten wrong.

Nothing happensWith most the bugs gone, this is one of my all time favorite RPGs.

Everything that happens in game actually happens whether you are there to see it or not. If an NPC moves to another town, he actually walks there in game. Nothing happens behind the scenes. Graphics are amazingly beautiful with the HD pack. I have a 1080 Ti and crank everything up at 2560x1440 to what they call \"experimental settings for future hardware\" and it runs smooth at around 70FPS. Combat takes some getting used to, because it truly is an RPG with realistic combat controls. You have to learn the controls, and your character has to learn to fight. Both can be accomplished by spending some time with a trainer and practicing. And once I got to learn it I think it is absolutely amazing and immersive. Lock-ons can be a little cumbersome though. I use some mods, because I am not as interested in inventory/cleanliness type meta games and mechanics. The official forums are the place to figure out how to get mods working, because most of them on nexus are no longer maintained and some simple text edits need to be done to get them working, but not all players are going to want to use mods. I absolutely must have unlimited inventory and unlimited save game mods, for my personal preference. I also use extended cleanliness, and some herb picking mods and a bow mechanic mod. I don\u0027t think there are many other mods than are working ATM, but the official forums is more active than Nexus right now. I highly recommend this game. I have spent a couple hundred hours on it now, and haven\u0027t finished, because I do everything, and I wanted to wait for the DLC\u0027s to come out before wrapping up the main story. Band of Bastards is a really good DLC, but has a couple minor bugs (it just came out). From the Ashes is cool, but maybe not for everyone. I have only done a little bit from the Sir Hans one so far, but I like it.… ",

Это просто деревенский увалень, который по продвижению сюжета меняет свой взгляд на жизненные вещи и сам этот процесс легко прощупывается, никакого изумления становление героя не вызывает. Хорошо ли это? Это аутентично, за этим куда более интересно следить, чем за очередным безымянным героем, который вначале никем, а после невероятного стечения обстоятельств обретает божественную силу. Сам игровой процесс не хардкорный, как предпочитают говорить почему-то большинство, он скорее увлекательный, требующий подхода и какого-то времени, но не потому что тяжелый, а потому что большинство привыкли к более простым механикам. Именно поэтому одним он очень понравится, а вторых будет отталкивать. В KCD действительно надо спать, в отличии от серии TES. Осторожно следует питаться и пить, это может привести к пьянству или ожирению/истощению, влияющим на характеристики. Очень порадовала боевая система, состоящая из двух типов ударов: колющий и режущий, их направления (сверху по голове, в торс, слева/справа в бедро или руку), а также контратак и множества комбинаций. Сложна тем, что при драке с 2+ противником возможность выиграть стремительно летит к нулю и это заставляет изощрятся в тактике, особенно в стелс миссиях. В луках нет перекрестия, но после нескольких часов ты привыкаешь к этому и приблизительно угадываешь куда полетит стрела в зависимости от силы натяжение тетивы. Воровство, торговля, взлом замков, алхимия - все очень занимательно. Каждый аспект игры требует наличия желания в нем разобраться и немалой усидчивости, чтобы не забросить это все в дальний угол. Отдельное уважение системе алхимии - лучшее, что я видел: строгая рецептура, дозировка и физический процесс готовки невероятно круто выглядят. Автосохранений тут тоже нет, есть спасительный шнапс - напиток, который позволяет сохранится в любом месте, но для этого нужно научиться читать (Индро читать не умеет в начале игры, но есть специальный квест специально для этого), выучить рецепт, запастись ингредиентами и только после наварить себе несколько баночек этого напитка. Ко всему этому следует помнить, что злоупотреблять им тоже не стоит, потому что может развиться та самая алкогольная зависимость, что будет очень плохо нерфить характеристики Индро, а по утрам вызывать похмелье. В целом мне все очень понравилось, мне было интересно читать исторические сводки по событиям и профессиям в Чехии времен Богемии, мне было интересно фехтовать, варить шнапс, обворовывать бомжей на улице и тусить с Яном Птачеком.… ",

I really had to put an effort to find one cutscene after which I liked the ending much more. What story? If this was part of the main story, it would enhance the whole Henry main story experience, it is good example how to tell a good story, has interesting parts and characters. Great. 5/5 ☑ Gameplay? Hard start and the combat keeps coming your way. Better bring those horses more often. Good. ⅘ ☑ Replayability? I discovered two endings, there are a few parts which can be resolved quite differently, sometimes missing on a considerable amount of content locked behind an option. Activities included. Great. ⅘ ☑ Graphics? While the game is beautiful, it has issues with blurry textures, especially in cutscenes where it strikes an eye the most. Then there are minor issues with blurry textures by default. Acceptable. ⅗ ☑ Music? ⅘ ☑ The music accompanies DLC in great way, however, the Czech song made me uneasy. Hardware requirements? Next gen. ☑ How difficult? Normal. ☑ How long? less than 2 hours. ☑ MAIN QUESTS 2-9 hours. ☑ SIDE QUESTS, ACTIVITY, DIALOGUES, REPLAYING /MINOR spoilers ahead Before you buy Consider playing the DLC3 only if your Henry focuses on combat, otherwise you will have hard times. Though you personally don\u0027t have to kill nobody, you may want to avoid it for the sake of Merciful achievement. You are about to join the Band of Bastards and you need to keep its leader and companions alive to finish all DLC quests. I would recommend to reach level 10 for start. You can combine playing it with other non-DLC related quests or explore open world because it feels like fraction of what could be part of the main quest, however, the story is divided into missions starting during daylight and quests are situated in open world so we can do anything else and possibly fail the DLC. You will be able to play one activity stretched in between the missions or investigate the location in another. Or play two mini games during other mission which do not repeat. Cutscenes and dialogues Bastards will talk to you whenever you rest somewhere, listen to their fantastic stories or continue the DLC whenever you come back. They have their own affairs and talk to each other while you are passive listener. Cutscenes are fun, dialogues are dramatic too, there are some adjustments to the environment locations. Brand new characters, some faces are recycled, new animations and locations. Your horse is finally eating the grass like normal horse but disappears after cutscenes. Bugs and issues It\u0027s relatively bug free DLC unless you go on killing rampage and kill some essential NPCs, then you might not be able to finish the last quest. There are few system performance issues during cutscenes and outside with detailed armor and faces which did not load fast enough. It took between 20-40 seconds to fully load details of textures and even after that they would reset (become blurry again) once the camera zooms out. It would look better as pre-baked, however you wouldn\u0027t be able to see your unique Henry and his horse. However, I am playing at about 30 FPS on Low or Ultra in cutscenes with mid-range gaming PC. There is not much difference in performance when I set the Graphics to Low or Ultra High. Your energy and nourishment are not depleted while travelling triggered by DLC. The time also does not pass by. Lyrics to the DLC song: “Zástupy děveček, potoky vína Dnes mě nic nesere, jsem mezi svýma Dnes mě nic nesere, dneska se slaví Příteli, pijeme, zbělají nám hlavy Ženská je, příteli, plemeno hadí Pusť si ji k sobě a ona tě zradí Srdce tě bolí, nechceš už jinou Nehledej, příteli, nalej si víno”… ",

It would seem that here it is a game of my dreams, but what is wrong? For me personally, there are 2 points, because of which I can not put the maximum rating. The combat system is sharpened to a duel, the fight with more than one opponent turns into some kind of torture, it immediately destroys all the pleasure from fighting in this game. By the next part, this problem needs to be solved, it is not necessary to process everything from scratch, the current combat system is beautiful, as an option, you can switch from focus on one opponent (as it is now) to free combat (dark messiah), such switching was for example sekiro or fable. Disgusting side quests, 90% of which bring-kill-steal quests. In 2018, this is just a bad tone, you have to get rid of this. Attract outside help, ideally let it be Chris Avellone, at least as a consultant, this will greatly increase the variability and quality of side quests. The final score: 8 out of 10. The potential of the franchess is huge. I look forward to part 2.… ",

Main quest is ok, and mainly there to guide the player through, while most fun should be from side quests, and roaming arround. No magic, dragons, or wizards here, so medieval simulation is somewhat appropriate calling. Hard core mode is a must if player wants to experiance the game as treuly envisioned by the devs. Recomandation is hiwever to finish game once in normal mode before starting HC. Combat system is not as good as in Mount and Blade, but it is far better then Skyrim or Witcher. There is skill involved. Balance is broken mainly by use of OP equipment by the player. Bow shooting is probably the most realistic interpretation of bows from any other game. 7.5 out of 10 Replayability: I would say 500hrs would be what most people will experiance doing at least two replays. 9 out of 10 Stability: lets jsu say issue still exist.

    "comments": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view. Why are people and reviewers giving this train wreck high scores? Have they played an entirely different game? TLDR: Don\u0027t buy this game, don\u0027t pirate it either, just don\u0027t waste your time with it. Kingdom Come Deliverance has a really cool concept behind, it might have a good story. If you can get past how bad the overall game is. Gameplay mechanics are horrible, the voice acting is bad, Henry often sounds like one of those 90s computer generated voices as opposed to a human. The dialogue is generally horrific. The music is quite horrible, I can tell they\u0027ve recorded real instruments but they sound incredibly washed out, I\u0027ve heard soundtracks made with orchestral sample libraries which sound way better. Reviewers rave about the \"role playing experience\", and yes you can choose what to do in the game (somewhat) but either Henry is a hypocrite or the developers decided to give him a set of morals without thinking about the player\u0027s actions. At the start of the game you can loot every corpse from Talmberg to Skalitz and still have the option to be all \"holier than thou\" with the grave robber. Let\u0027s talk about gamepley: pickpocketing? That just doesn\u0027t work. Even when you manage to take something before the countdown expires. Combat? It\u0027s bad. Welcome to \"Walking Backwards: The Game\". I only wished. Not only does it suffer from horrible weightless animations but it just doesn\u0027t work, the lack of physics and weight behind strikes is just unbearable, there is no proper tutorial to explain how that mess works, the targeting and lock on mechanics don\u0027t work half the time. They tried to make it \"realistic\" but honestly just look for any HEMA video recorded with a head cam and see the difference for yourself. On the subject of realism: If you play hardcore mode you\u0027ll come across enemies that will one or two shot kill you, regardless of what equipment is being used by either combatants. The first \"boss\" of the game isn\u0027t wearing a helmet, and despite me actually landing two head hits with my longsword nothing happened. Whilst he gets two hits with his bat and I\u0027m K.O. (Regardless of the fact that I was wearing gambeson, mail, padded coif, mail coif, and helmet which I got after knocking out a guard in Talmberg). Later I was doing Theresa\u0027s uncle\u0027s quest, on the road to the executioner I spotted three bandits readying for an ambush. I sneaked up behind them and managed to kill two, but the third one (an archer with no armor except for an aketon and a seemingly wool hood) spots me, I get in close before he can shoot me and hit him several times in the head, he yields and runs away and in doing so has become GOD because he\u0027s invulnerable to everything. Last I checked if you hit someone with a longsword in the head and all he\u0027s wearing is a hoodie they aren\u0027t going to be running around for long. How about role-playing? Well, they said you could find multiple solutions to resolve a problem and complete a quest. So I decided to go for that grave robbing quest and get the blasted ring. I wait until dark, find the grave, no ring. So I think to myself: \"maybe the bugger took it\" so I take the initiative and sneak into his house, knock him out while he sleeps and search every inch of that place. No ring. The I return to the miller and he goes like: \"the ring must be inside his house in a chest somewhere\". guess what? The ring will spawn only AFTER you tell the miller there was no ring on the corpse. SO IMMERSED. Talking about \"immersion\". Not only is the HUD utterly horrible, seriously, you have the useless dot everywhere except for when you actually need it (archery) so why bother in the first place? If you try to climb over a (not even that steep a hill you\u0027ll realize either Henry has the motor skills of a 2 year old or the developers never went hiking because there\u0027s paths where the average person could EASILY walk over but Henry can\u0027t. Oh of course if you try to jump you\u0027ll somehow jump backwards, fall and injure yourself. (Never mind the fact that one could easily use his hands to aid in climbing very steep places) incredibly demanding yet awful graphics (I mean, I don\u0027t know who was in charge of the animations in this game but by the grace of God are they horrible) but most importantly, it\u0027s poorly executed. Don\u0027t know if this was supposed to be a Triple A or Double A release, and I know it comes from a small studio etc. etc. but this is a clear example of someone trying to bite more than they can chew. I just wished I could get my money back but unfortunately that only happens if you encounter a technical problem, not if the game is bad.… ",

I was excited to finally get a historical medieval RPG and I have to say that the game delivers that in spades. It\u0027s refreshing to see actual real world kingdoms engaging in war and have a game set in a medieval fantasy without it being bogged down by magic, elves, orcs, etc. The story and the voice acting is also pretty stellar itself. However, that\u0027s the end of what I think are the game\u0027s strongest points. This gem is bogged down by various weird design choices, clunky mechanics, horrible optimization, and bugs galore even though the game itself has been out for over a year. The combat, one of the most interesting aspects of the game for me just feels, not great. Is it realistic? Yes. Does it capture the closterphobia and chaos of real medieval fights? Yes. However the god awful lock on, not explained clinch mechanic, not explained one-handed vs. two-handed differences, and the depth-perception issues really drag it down. I would find myself having difficulties in fights not because of my own skills, but rather because i was having to wrestle the camera to switch between multiple enemies whenever it felt like sticking to someone. I would also constantly misjudge the distance between enemies and myself due to the lack of depth perception from the games unique camera style of your character being a fully rendered model that you can see with the camera being placed on your head. Also the parrying mechanic didn\u0027t feel really balanced, with you being staggered and counter attacked whenever you get parried however when ever you parry an enemy they immediately block your counterattack. Archery is also difficult due to the lack of depth perception, the fact that you can\u0027t aim before drawing, and that your arrow doesn\u0027t go where you\u0027re pointing it. As someone who does real life archery with historically designed bows I can guarantee that it\u0027s by far much easier in real life than it is in game which is just weird. Also the lockpicking and stealth mechanics of the game don\u0027t feel great. Lockpicking is this really weird, **** it system in which if you try and go about it slowly you\u0027ll just break your picks, rather you need to just force the lock. It feels like such a step back when you look at the lock picking system or skyrim or fallout which feels much better and more intuitive. The game also has this weird disconnect between it\u0027s immersion systems. You have to constantly ensure that your guy is fed and sleeps, however you can\u0027t start fires to cook, you can\u0027t set up camps to sleep. You can\u0027t buy or build homes in various towns to ensure that you always have a place to rest. Also you can\u0027t quick bind things, you want to change from your longsword to your mace? You have to go into a menu. You want to eat? Go into the menu. You just got into a tavern brawl that forces you to use your fists? You better go into the menu to ensure that you re-equip your weapons because the game doesn\u0027t automatically do that for you. All of this just makes the \"immersion\" and inventory mechanics feel clunky and unimmersive. Finally, the bugs. Oh my god are some of them bad. You sometimes get the fun and weird bugs like everyone in town\u0027s voice lines being replaced with lines as if they\u0027re looking for you while you\u0027re in stealth. But then you get game breaking bugs. Quest NPCS being frozen in place with you not being able to talk to them. NPCs blocking you into building so you\u0027re just stuck unless the game randomly decides that the NPC no longer has collision. You get pushed by an enemy into a bush that you\u0027re now trapped in for all eternity. Falling into a pile of sticks that you can\u0027t get out of. You and your horse just randomly being stuck while walking. And good old fashioned infinite load screens, which come from everything, even just changing your control settings. All in all the game is a nice gesture and I wish to see Warhorse improve for their future projects, however this \"immersive\" RPG never fails to unimmerse me with the constant need to be in the menus, clunky mechanics, and various bugs.… ",

This fact alone makes Deliverance worth playing. I\u0027ve spent massive amounts of time on this game, which mostly had to do with exploring the gorgeous landscape and killing every bandit, Cuman and traveler on sight and searching for hidden treasure chests. the simple card playing game at the taverns was also more fun than it had any right to be. Combat is a mixture of Dark Souls\u0027 typical stamina management, blocking and evading attacks and Mount \u0026 Blade\u0027s directional attacks; fighting is generally fun, if you\u0027re not overwhelmed by big amounts of robbers at once. Kingdom Come is a flawed but still immensely enjoyable open world RPG. If good games instill the feeling of being transported, Deliverance achieves this by being a compelling portrait of medieval life in Bohemia. As of now it is one of only a handful of purely non fantasy RPGs, which I am always going to prefer to the nth standard fantasy game.… ",

They tried to make it realistic, but that failed miserably and it\u0027s the reason this game is not an easy 9 or even 10. It all just feels slow, clunky and unresponsive, even at high skill levels. - The AI is crap. Enemies can track and attack you during pitch black night. - There\u0027s a save game limit and the players need to manage (i.e. delete) their save games. - Issues with impassable terrain like ledges you should easily be able to pass. - You can get stuck in trees. - The save system is supposed to make decisions important, but it can be frustrating sometimes. After losing half an hour of progress, you just want a regular saving system. - No inventory management (mark as trash etc.). Mount inventory not available from vendor screen. - Sometimes you get a bounty on your head and it\u0027s not clear why. I know the developers wanted the game to be immersive and unforgiving, but I think making it a bit more user friendly and accessible, like The Witcher 3, would have been better. It\u0027s their vision and how they like the game to be and I accept that, but despite liking a lot of things about the game, the issues -especially the combat and saving systems- prevented me from finishing the game.… ",

Минусы - это первая игра разработчиков, деньги с Кикстартера, не хватает масштаба. Но даже без скидок на бюджет, выглядит она просто нереально красиво.

Pros: The World building that this game does is amazing. The language and interactions are so in depth, I have not been so immersed in a world in quite a while. Just having every character greet you with \"Jesus Christ be praised\" while signing a cross or having a guard stop you at night because you aren\u0027t carrying a torch just amuses me. The progression system is one of a kind. Not in the sense of what it offers, but in the way it goes about doing it. You start off as an extremely incompetent soldier and the game makes you feel it. You are terrible at combat, lockpicking, etc. almost to the point of frustration. But you don\u0027t just magically get better by pouring a few skill points into a category. You must continuously progress until you are confident at the skill. Everything feels earned and worked for. You aren\u0027t some wonder child or even an average joe. But this allows you to learn the game systems and really feel like your skill as a gamer makes progress. Most quests are well thought out, none of them are simple or predictable. great variety. Cons: The story is a bit lackluster. Its not bad, just won\u0027t knock you off your feet or leave you feeling satisfied. The man character Henry is extremely static. I progress through most of the story, killing many man and saving many, but he had the same sense of being inferior as if he didn\u0027t notice all the heroic acts that he had done. Some of the quests can be TOO tedious. You think you are in for a simple task, however it has so many twists and turns that it might deter some from enjoying the game. It took me a week (with normal everyday life in between) just to complete one quest ! The equipment is a little lacking. You never really feel the need to switch weapons often because they are all pretty standard. There are a lot of useless skills that really play no role in the game.

In my opinion, this game is what The Elder Scrolls games should be - less casual, more realistic and with challenging combat system. I haven\u0027t completed the game yet but I find it really captivating and overall a very satisfying experience for a hardcore gamer. Of course there are some questionable moments like e.g. when you put people unconscious they don\u0027t alert the guards after waking up, you only can buy a horse and can\u0027t tame horses you find in bandit camps, there are no wild animals in forests (at least, I didn\u0027t find any), etc. But I\u0027d call those moments pretty insignificant.… ",

I even looked up places and people in it and they really existed! I myself live in Europe and the graphics and atmosphere are extremely authentic. The woods really feel like European woods. And they arent empty either! There are bandits, loggers, many different animals, people in distress, patrols, people who try to screw you over, etc. The villages and cities all feel very alive and have their real day and night cycle. For example you wont find an open store at night, but you might find the shopkeepers and guards that had a shift at day in a tavern. The guards will stop you and search you if you look suspicious and at night will scold you if you dont have a torch out. The story is extremely diverse, too. You can do good things, not so good things and bad things. Sometimes intentionally, sometimes not. Even the superstition of those times is very well depicted. The dialogue is very good and sometimes even very deep. The characters are all likable (or unlikable, if intended). You might even start to like some characters that you disliked before, because they are so well made and with time show their real personality. The side quests are actually really fun and dont feel like MMO quests, like in most other games nowadays. And they can be mostly completed (or messed up) in different ways. And theres no modern political/PC/SJW BS, which would only destroy the historical accuracy. However the politics of that time are very well depicted. Sometimes you will hate them, yet have to follow them (or dont, if you want and take the consequences). But other times you will at first think they are horrible, only to realize people really arent all stereotypes and actually have their own mind. Sure, it has quite a few bugs. Even today still. But they are tolerable, because the game blows you away with everything else. And if you save the game regularly, you can dodge them one or the other way almost completely. I cant really describe it any other way than as a masterpiece of art. It helped me rediscover my love for medieval history, too. Even if you pirated this game, you should realize how well it was done and still buy it so they can do a sequel. And the sequel will be an instant buy for me, and I normally dont buy games at release.… ",

I\u0027ve never seen any more realistic depiction of nature in a game before. it seems every inch of the game world is handcrafted with great amount of attention to detail instead of just copy pasting like it is done in other open world games. you don\u0027t see this attention to detail even in triple A titles from big, rich developers. - Gameplay: combat system is one of the best. at first it felt clunky but after several hours of playtime it became very satisfying and rewarding. it\u0027s not just button mashing, you have to learn how to fight, you have to think before every move. - Sound and music and voice acting: great specially if you consider it\u0027s from an independent developer with not so big budget. - Atmosphere: you can really feel the atmosphere of middle ages. very realistic and accurate in my opinion. Cons - Bugs: as of now despite many patches(game version 1.9) there are still some bugs. imagine how buggy it was on release date. - Performance and optimization: this game requires high end GPU and CPU. even on a top end PC, frequent frame drops can occur specially in big cities. also SSD is a must. at first I installed it on a HDD and the experience was frustrating to say the least. long loading times everywhere. just starting a conversation with random NPC leads to several seconds of watching loading screen. exiting the conversation also another several seconds. every single activity needs loading time, surprisingly long too. even textures takes a long time to load, sometime it takes more than five seconds to appear on objects around you! loading time on HDD was extremely nerve-racking. but installing it on SSD solved most of those issues. texture loading issue is fully solved and loading times are now greatly reduced. if you don\u0027t have a SSD just forget about this game unless you have the patience of a saint. Overall this game is great, I would give it 9 because of bugs and those performance issues but I have not enjoyed a game this much at least over the last decade so how can I give it less than 10.… ",

Very well written story and lore, the characters in KCD are living and full of life and give you that really immersive feeling of being in the 1400\u0027s. There seems to always be something new hiding around that corner, this game will capture you for countless hours on end exploring the medieval world Warhorse created for you. There really is too much to list and mention, lots of skills to master and you can only level up a skill if you\u0027re using that skill. I adore this type of a progression system, it makes for more fun and more overall play. You are able to train with npcs to gain experience in combat, not only are you getting better proficiencies but you actually have to get better yourself via M\u0026K or controller. It\u0027s a skill game and the game is not going to hold your hand. The combat system is brutal and very frustrating at first, you will find yourself pulling your hair out when you have two guys lopping long swords at you pummeling you with one hit knocking you down. The combat in KCD is very brutal and realistic, once you start grasping the controls and practicing and learning and training and training (seriously...name of the game is training) it gets more fun and less frustrating, stick with it and learn the combat learn how to defend yourself and attack correctly. This isn\u0027t a game you just rambo in and hack and slash... tried it.. failed miserably. That is what makes this game stand out above the rest...realism to the bone. All in first person so when you receive a blow to the old head.. your vision is getting twisted just like it would in rl. Your head almost does a 180..lol Good times.

The fact it\u0027s so hard has made it a cult classic, but don\u0027t fall for the hype or advertising dollars. Wasted a night playing it that I\u0027ll never get back, not to mention money.… ",

There are so many redeeming qualities of this game, so many mechanics and quests that are actually fun and worth while playing but over all the core game-play of sword fighting or just combat in general is bad, so bad that it just overshadows and good qualities of this game. The characters are actually interesting and the quests, including the sided quest, are fun and you care about their stories because the dialogue is put together really well. The world is interesting to traverse, the forest feels like a real forest and not just the same tree copy and pasted multiple times, the towns feel authentic and it\u0027s real easy to become immersed in this game, until you have to do anything. I understand the game goes for a real feeling but it\u0027s too much to the point where it feels clunky and simple tasks feel tiresome. The combat is by far the worst, the lock-on is awful and sticks you to a enemy so hard it\u0027s almost impossible to turn and run, which is impossible on it\u0027s own because all enemies are Usain Bolt and can slash you while you run which you cannot do. And then there\u0027s archery, good luck because all enemies are snipers that can almost kill you with one shot and for your character you might as well be using a Nerf bow and arrow, even if you somehow land a head shot it does nothing to them. By far the worst of all is getting stuck, I got stuck several times most times having to reload and try again, as soon as things like that happens in a already frustrating game-play i find it hard to enjoy a game. But the war it happened multiple times where I would get stuck between a ramp and a slight incline of the ground, that\u0027s insane how this gets through QC, and then when my guys had to ram a door they were glitched out against the castle wall and the quest couldn\u0027t continue, I\u0027m sorry but your game is unplayable and i can\u0027t give it anymore of my time it. I wish i could like this game, i even thought i was loving this game, but bad mechanics, op archers, and just all around broken game-play makes it impossible to enjoy this game no matter how good the story is. For that reason this game goes in my bad pile because glitched out NPCs breaking the game.… ",

More precisely the subject moves around Henry, blacksmiths son, who wants to return his sword and his honor. Henry turns to serve sir Radzig Kobyla and investigate for him some bandit mystery connected to the war. The main thing is «Kingdom Come: Deliverance» delivers unprecedentedly immersive simulation to medieval times at its core. As Henry you will eat at the tavern, sleep on the hay, hunt with your lord and your doggie, fight for your life and your honor, be a peasant or be a lord yourself. There are also possibilities to thieving and romancing or just visiting the baths, if you know what I mean... And many other things you would do in medieval times. As from being a monk to building your own village as a richtarge. And maybe even more importantly you will be enjoying the views, the wild, pastoral life, beautiful rivers and lakes. Live the real life connected to the nature once again, because Kingdom Come delivers this possibility to appreciate the nature and beauty of contemplation. While on horse of without it, imagining yourself a knight or a peasant, you will be appreciating the sights in this game every time. Between this you will experience the joy (or maybe not so much) of learning essentials about the game – from the gameplay to the politics. Gameplay wise the game is a perfect RPG, unless a bunch of annoying bags happening every now and then. Fighting is fun, thriving is fun, bargaining is fun, even surviving is fun, if you appreciate the immersion. Only the fighting system can come not the type for everyone and has some unexpectedly funny tree climbing during the epic fight. But features like combat wheel, wheel of thieving, running wheels from your enemies will keep you on pace. Story is good, but sometimes subtle – realistic while has its medieval epic in it. With the additional quests combined it becomes the true journey all across medieval Bohemia with its anecdotic and anecdotal antiquity. All in all, if searching for that type of experience, would highly recommend. It has everything if only not the pure action. 9 of 10 for perfect immersion and interesting game on its own. (-1 for rolling bugs)… ",

Everything has weight to it and each battle feels like a struggle in the best way possible. While hand to hand combat is clunky and the five-prong attack system feels like a less robust version of Skyward Sword\u0027s sword combat, it still doesn\u0027t take away the fun you\u0027ll have. Quests are as various as they are multifaceted. The story is surprisingly well told with a great main character, Henry. I also have to commend the designers on presenting the world of 15th century Bohemia as it was. No modern day revisionism. No tongue in cheek critiques on their culture/religion. They show you the world and how it is, nothing more and certainly nothing less. This is perhaps one of the best RPG\u0027s in the past decade if not the best. Recommended to all RPG fans.… ",

    "comments": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view. Realism sucks, terrible combat, terrible dodging, blocking mechanic. Getting ambushed by 4 cumans with great armour and swords on 3 or 4 lvl of your character. At this point the story does not matter. It is fine and I liked it but learning combat made me hate this game instead. Every part of combat learning makes me sick. I\u0027m actually wondering hom much money did you guys get for giving 10/10 reviews? You attack once and your enemy attacks you 3 times without any chance to block. Awful. Have to play defensively and try countering their attacks which happens maybe 1/10 of the times. Went for a second playthrough and playing with bows is a mess until lvl 5, but is helpful later on. Additionally switched from sword to mace and it was much better, but still fighting 1 v 4 is terrible nonetheless. Locking mechanic makes it imbossible to run away and take a better position, you are forced to fight outnumbered. Some **** miner can block/dodge every hit from a mace without a problem. You are making it complicated and long for no reason. Some quests are bound to be failed (Hans Capon gets shot), some are bugged if you try to them your way, a quest with Rapota gives you an ability to kill him instead of sending him to Radzig or executioner and guess what- you are sent to jail for killing a bandit. If you want to be realistic - that\u0027s fine, but not all realistic things are fun and some of them are bugged.… ",
