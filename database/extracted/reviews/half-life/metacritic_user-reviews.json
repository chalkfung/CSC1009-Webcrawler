Now let\u0027s get down to business. The game is unfortunately very uneven, and whilst the first half is excellent, I soon found myself losing interest around the middle section of the game. The pacing really starts to suffer around this point,with too many sections where it\u0027s very unclear what you\u0027re supposed to be doing. The story, for a game that recieved so much praise for its \"deep\" storyline, is not developed nearly enough - we\u0027re left with just \"experiment goes wrong, aliens appear, government soldiers arrive to cover it up, and you have to do something about it all\", and that\u0027s more or less it. Now System Shock 2, that was a game with a fully-developed backstory that you could really sink your teeth into. With Half-Life, the story was mostly irrelevant and in itself provided little incentive to continue. In addition, the final couple of stages are nothing less than ridiculous. So overall, a game that heralded a (brief) new era for the FPS genre, but didn\u0027t quite live up to its own hype. … ",

I think when it came out I played this game 5 times over before I even touched any other game, it really was that good!",

Of course HL2 is better in every way- they had all the feed back gotten from the original to work off of, as well as 6 years to make what is still the best graphics engine in existance. For its time and even now, i still think Half life has one of the most rewarding single player experiences in the industry, both in length and quality. it took me a year to beat it on hard mode, and still takes a comparable amount of time to do the same. to mr. Rami W.- please, play the game before reviewing it. there is no \"money\" involved whatsoever in half life. maybe you\u0027re thinking Counter strike. there aren\u0027t even \"objectives\" in half life.… ",

But the vehicle part of the game was only the first thing that made me hate it. Then on top of that you have annoying characters. If it were possible, I would have killed all of my allies within the first 5 seconds of meeting any one of them. And believe me, I tried. Alex is the worst by far. Everyone is useless and annoying.

He\u0027ll do all of our work for us because we\u0027re lazy/incompetent/useless.\" If I was Freeman, I\u0027d just let everyone die. Or better yet, kill them all myself. The only thing that would get me to consider playing the sequels would be if I got to go on a murderous rampage killing all of my allies. You waste more ammo than anything. With any automatic weapon, it seems that at best 1/3 shots hit their mark. It\u0027s impossible to aim with them because instead of your spray pattern being affected by how long you hold the trigger, it follows some kind of pattern. Your first shot might hit its target. It might not. It\u0027s horribly frustrating. I bought the Orange Box back in January after hearing how great it was. Worst $50 I\u0027ve ever spent, since the only good part of the whole thing is Portal. About 4 months ago I got killed somewhere near the end of the game.

Everything is awesome until were the game should have ended. Before The Desert. I mean, you fight through everything until you get to the main goal of making it to the surface after that everything drags on. Its directionless. Once you open the doors to get to the desert that is when you should have been revieled the entire plot of everything, but no you keep going. Sometimes its feels like the level designer is trying to fill the game with cheap tricks instead of good design when you get to this point. This is were the fun ends. Honestly, the desert and the levels after should have been an expansion that no one bought, it totaly deviates from the game\u0027s design. Even the soldiers AI seems confused and out of place. If the desert wasn\u0027t apart of the game I would give this game a 10 and the desert a 5. Actually, I stopped playing after I hit the desert because it really pisses me off and I can tell the rest of the game is like it because I briefly played it.… ",

If it was \u002798, I would most likely give it a 10, but due to the antiquated graphics and somewhat slow storyline compared to contemporary titles, I can\u0027t get into it as much. However, everything is very well designed and the experience is top-notch.",

A lack of cut-scenes prevents gameplay break, so the player is constantly on his toes in a desperate bid for survival. Graphics are solid for it\u0027s time, but have definitely aged. Shooting is fun and intuitive, and the game heaps a truckload of interesting and varied weapons for you to use. Boss fights play out like puzzles, challenging you to find their weaknesses. Sadly, the only thing that soils this game is the Xen stages at the very end, a commonly cited complaint for this game. The complete change in atmosphere and tone comes suddenly after hours in Black Mesa, a jarring experience for many. Thankfully, the last boss manages to be interesting enough in it\u0027s own right. Half-Life remains a solid gaming experience for any gamer looking for that extra challenge.… ",

The graphics are obviously bad, considering the games age, but if you can look past that, this game is no doubt a gem. If you can\u0027t get over how bad the graphics are, you might try Half-Life 2 first instead. If you\u0027re a sci-fi FPS fan who likes thought-provoking video games, I wouldn\u0027t be surprised to hear after playing HL2 you\u0027ll want to come back and give this one another shot \u003d).

The final part for my review is the story and what a story it has. While i wont go to deep into a detail about it, here is a small rundown aliens are attacking earth and you need to escape the base black mesa.

But still...I hated few things. For example, the jumping parts: you can easily lose health by jumping 1 cm more higher than normal (and we talk about 10 hp or more), and so you\u0027ll sometimes HAVE TO use ladders or avoid crazy jumps which, in many games, won\u0027t harm you. Even if the AI is challenging, some enemies are just far too hard in my opinion and sometimes the game becomes very unbalanced (the soldiers were the hardest m------ers I\u0027ve ever beaten, while all the other aliens were easier, even the biggest ones). Add also that the explosions are very big, meaning that you can still get hit even if you\u0027re far at times (I got hit also when I was hiding behind crates, not too far away, while I shot at some bombs attached to the wall...this still scarred me). And, if I have to be brutal, some parts looked unneccesary and to me they looked like \"add ups\" instead of real continuation.

It played a large part in defining my science fiction existence. No FPS had been anything like it before. This was largely in part due to scripted sequences. Instead of cutscenes, things actually played out infront of your eyes while you were still playing. It set the standard that nearly all games followed since then. The levels were also ingenius. Each level was its own separate level, but designed in a way to look like it was seamless. Level A would end in a hallway, a loading bar would pop up while it loaded level B, with the beginning of Level B looking just like that hallway. It gave a sense that you were never really removed from the game world. The storytelling was great as well. Instead of just being overloaded with cheesey information, you start off simply as a regular scientist working in a secret underground research facility somewhere in the south US known as Black Mesa. While performing a landmark experiment despite safety concerns from officials, you accidentally open a portal to an alien world. This experiment causes a \"resonance cascade effect\" (whatver that means) which causes temporal rifts to open throughout the entire facility, warping in hostile alien forces. The entire game is a story about surviving against all odds. The plot thickens even further as US Special forces are sent in. When you first see them you think \"Awesome, backup!\" but soon find out they aren\u0027t there to rescue you: they\u0027re there to destroy you \u0026 all the evidence with it. It thickens even further when you advance through the game, you hear the Special forces are pulling out because its too much for even them to handle and you get the hint they are about to nuke the entire facility into oblivion. One of the reasons the storyline is so great is because its so plausible. The actions from the scientists to the Special forces makes sense. If Half Life actually happened, it would very likely play out something like the game. Nothing turns me off more than an implausible story. From the scripted sequences of scientists screaming by on a falling elevator, survivors in vents scared out of their minds, half life delivers an incredible variety of experiences. Action, suspense, hopelessness, triumph, uncertainty. While playing, you really couldn\u0027t predict what would happen next which is always one of the signs of a good story. A real 10/10, and it isn\u0027t awarded lightly either.… ",

The only things keeping me from going higher than an 8 are the minor system discrepancies and the story. It was very confusing, but that\u0027s partially my fault for not wearing headphones. It\u0027s difficult to hear dialogue without headphones and lack of a captioning system makes it impossible to know what\u0027s going on if you\u0027re not wearing headphones. The saving system is also hard to work with. There was no autosave feature, so I had to force myself to save every 5 minutes or so. The last thing (I think this is really important) is the developer console. If you\u0027re familiar with the Source engine and the half life commands like I am, then it\u0027s just a few keystrokes to give you mac ammo/armor/health. With no achievements to deter the usage of \"sv_cheats 1\", this option is very appealing for those having trouble in the game. Overall, I thought this game was great. I\u0027ve replayed it about 5 times for a total of 6 playthroughs just because I like some of the combat in it. I would suggest buying this game at full price if you want it because it is worth full price.… ",

The action is set in the fictional Black Mesa Research Facility, where the player takes the role of Doctor Gordon Freeman, a Ph. D, MIT Theoretical Physics scientist. So the beginning is nothing really special, but the action itself begins only after the disaster. After being late, Gordon steps in his HEV Suit MK IV, and enters the chamber where they test a special crystal from a borderworld called Xen. During the preparations, the scientist make a mistake by settings the Anti-Mass Spectrometer at 105% causing malfunction, and after inserting the crystal in the spectrometer, everything goes wrong. The machine doesn\u0027t respond and in the same time numerous alien creatures enter Earth and the facility through outnumbered portals opened during the incident. After this Gordon must fight his way outside the facility, which is a hard job after the facility goes infested with aliens, and even more, zombies. After seeing the disaster, the Marines are called to ,,clean,, the mess, and destroy the facility. Until the end of the game, Gordon rapidly becomes the prime target for the marines, who now must eliminate him, considering that the mess is only his fault, and eventually temporary captures him. During the game, Gordon must solve puzzles, and is also helped on his way by security guards and scientist pinned down in the facility. Until the end, Gordon makes his way in a last refuge of the remaining science team, where he finds out that the rocket(that he previously launched) didn\u0027t make full effect, and the portals were still kept opened from the other side. As I already gave some spoilers, I won\u0027t reveal the next parts. The game play is just pure awesomeness. Gordon uses many real weapons such as mp5, 9mm Glock Pistol, Spas-12 Shotguns and others, to fight his way out the facility. The AI is really good, the enemies aren\u0027t blindly attacking the player and other suicidal things, and using their own tactics to stop the player. The game features some scripted sequences, that makes the game feel more cinematic, but not a ridiculous amount, and just where needed. Also the game itself is linear, so there aren\u0027t many places you can miss during the game, but there are some, and still, even so, the game feels fluent, and the story doesn\u0027t really seem to be forced. But even so, the game has a great replay value, and has a real memorable journey. The graphics aren\u0027t ground-breaking, but even nowadays looks kind of decent, but outdated compared to others. The game also features an both integrated, and separate multiplayer(the separate one is called Half-Life: Deathmatch), with no kind of plot, separate from the story, just in the same universe and just for fun, by being able to nuke some maps, where you must get in time inside the protected place to not get killed, but the game can also contain and be played on coop maps, in which you must complete the map\u0027s objective, solve puzzles, but also kill enemies here and there to progress. Also due to the very friendly engine, the game can be very easily modded, by adding new maps, re-create the original weapons, sounds and more, or even make separate mods from the original game, which led to the creation of one of the biggest modding communities, most notable mods being Sven Co-Op, Black Operations, Life\u0027s End, but many many others. There game also inspired a re-creation, called Black Mesa, being a total Source recreation of the original game, with same levels, but better physics, and graphics. So my final word for the game is that is a masterpiece, with very little flaws(this ones being only bugs and minor glitches), and deserves to be played numerous times.… ",

I will admit the last few chapters don\u0027t quite hold up to everything else beforehand, but they\u0027re still decent; and the conclusion of the game doesn\u0027t disappoint, it\u0027s quite mysterious (and a cliffhanger). The game is a 10/10 for people like me, but I don\u0027t expect everyone to feel the same way, because there\u0027s not much story, it\u0027s 99% action. Regardless, it\u0027s a must-play.… ",

The first thing that hit me (playing it in 2013) was the graphics (produced 1998).

I laughed a bit at the graphics at the beginning, but I don\u0027t think I thought about them again after the 10 minute mark. At all. I became so immersed in the story that I didn\u0027t have any spare thoughts to give. I launched it expecting to play an hour, but was surprised when 3 o\u0027clock rolled around and I hadn\u0027t eaten anything! The very next day, I started it up telling myself I wouldn\u0027t let that happen again. The story kept my full attention and I had to be called for dinner. At that moment I realized, after making me do nothing but game on that one game all day, two days in a row(which I try never to let happen), that Half Life was exactly what everyone told me it would be. After thinking about it for a bit, I have decided that it is one of the best single-player games I have ever played, if not for but everything other than the graphics (which doesn\u0027t even matter, after one stops obsessing over them and remember exactly when it was made). One thing that I was really impressed about was the variety of weapons one found. For me, in different situations I liked to whip out Weapon X to confront Guy A and then switch to Weapon Y to finish off Alien B, or altogether stay back and pick them off with Weapon Z. I also impressed with the amount of ammo you get throughout the duration of the game. Half Life seems to give you just enough ammo for Favorite Gun X that you have to pick and choose when you want to use it while still allowing you to use it when you want without fear that you will be left defenseless. I leaves you with exactly enough to get by a point in the game to make you FEEL that you might run out. My favorite thing about Half Life is its adrenaline moments. This game keeps you on your feet the entire time. Aliens can teleport in at any time, you walk around a corner and you are assaulted on all sides, an unseen headcrab jumps at your face, something completely unexpected happens. You can never take any little task for granted in this game; if something happens normally a two or three times, its a prime target for some sort of unexpected jump. The negative reviews seem to all say the same thing: Bad graphics, how they don\u0027t understand the story, and that the character movement is difficult to manage. To enjoy the game, you have to let go of the graphics. Simple as that. If you are one of those guys that won\u0027t even touch a game that has bad graphics, you can download Source SDK Base 2007 and the free mod Black Mesa (It is basically the same story, minor changes, newer graphics, but it is not made by Valve nor does it have the end portion of the game). The story is not exactly explained to you like a storyteller is explaining it to you, but instead you have to deduce from what you are asked to do in the game and the results of those actions what exactly is happening. If you did not understand why you did a certain task, I would suggest looking up the chapter you just completed (it says whenever you save on the list of loads which chapter you are on) on the internet. I know I missed at least one thing while playing this game, and it really helps keep the game enjoyable and understandable as you progress. Now, for some reason people are complaining about how hard it is to jump across a pit of *insert miserable object here* or how they can\u0027t use ladders, falling to their death in either case. This game does have its very short and subtle moments of parkour, but it is only difficult if you make it difficult. For these moments I can only tell you to jump at the last moment or look around to see if there is another way around/another jumping point. Lastly, the WASD keys are automatically set to a \"Run\" or \"Jog\" type of action. To climb down a ladder in real life, you wouldn\u0027t RUN down the ladder, would you? There is a \"Walk\" key--normally bound to SHIFT, where you can approach the ladder as one would in real life; walking carefully and accessing it full on and not an angle. After addressing a good 80% of the reviews, lets take a look at the numbers now. As of today, 1826 people thoroughly enjoyed this game. 34 people were pretty OK with this game, but generally had some problems with it. 108 people (80 of which I have addressed) did not like the game at all. That leaves 28 people who just didn\u0027t like the game because they were not that into it legitimately (which I can totally accept). 28 out of 1968 people on Metacritic did not like this game for reasons that are unchangeable. If that trend continues for whoever reads this and is wondering if they should get Half Life, you have a 98.577% chance(1940 people who liked the game 1968 total people) of liking this game(rating it 5 or higher) or a 92.785% chance (1826 people 1968 total people) of enjoying this game a lot(rating it a 7 or higher). I\u0027d say those are good odds.… ",

Of all the games I have played, Half Life has by far the best level design. You will experience that there isn\u0027t just one way of getting through a section of the game. Throughout the 15 hour campaign, I honestly felt none of the levels were repetitive which is something that should be praised as it was the first ever game made by Valve. The enemies are varied and challenging, in fact, its one of the most difficult games I have ever played. I often watched walkthroughs to help me progess. Nevertheless, the enemies are outstanding, level design is incredible and the length of the game is very satisfying.

Weapons are wide-ranged and for the 90\u0027s the graphics are top notch. Go play it, you might not LOVE it but you\u0027ll still enjoy.… ",

The fast paced, old school FPS action in this game is fantastic and fun, and should certainly keep fans of old school FPS games interested, along with a pretty interesting story, though it\u0027s certainly not as good as its sequel. The cons of this game include relatively boring enemies at many points, sometimes the levels feel quite drawn out, and the movement can feel somewhat iffy on newer machines (at least as far as I can tell). Overall, this game is definitely worth a playthrough in the very least if you\u0027re a fan of other Valve titles or old school shooters.… ",

One of the key features of a \"Rail Shooter\", go from point a to point b with few diversions \u0026 no backtracking. Rail Shooter as in like a train, you always keep moving. Valve knows that backtracking gets frustrating faster than anything else, and is the most artificial way to enhance difficulty (hell increasing the damage the player takes is a better way if only marginally). Valve is also fond of vent crawling and puzzles which I\u0027ve never seen much appeal in apart from the initial novelty of vent crawling. Apart from being very moddable and userfriendly, Half-Life also does something incredibly well that has helped modders improve their own skills, and thats level design. Each place in the game looks hand crafted. No copy and pasting of sections or randomization here! It also knows how to be challenging without throwing tons of enemies at you, and thats with good enemy placement as well as knowing when to give the player rewards (weapon/ammo/health placement).

Despite being dated (1998) the graphics are amazing for their time, and despite the textures on the original not being high-resolution, the game still scales to 1080p perfectly and remains crisp and sharp. Although the textures themselves are obviously dated, the atmosphere that the team have created for Half-Life is wonderful. The into cinematic scene is still possibly the best introductory sequence of any game ever to date. It draws you into the world that is Half-Life, and you feel right at home from the start. The characters speak with you, address you by name, involve you in conversations among themselves, and even those who are not needed for the game to proceed will acknowledge you; something even most modern titles fail to do. The story-telling is excellent, moving transitionally from chapter to chapter without the need for annoying cut-scenes or sequences or flashbacks. Because of this, you\u0027re truly immersed in the gameplay since you are never distracted or removed from the first-person view at any time. The dialogue is incredible, the story is immaculate, and the gameplay is fantastic. The puzzles, enemies, friends and allies, and sound effects, the charm; this game set the bar for almost every first person shooter. The only thing which makes this game sub-par to Half-Life 2 is two minor things; the graphical limitations (which I know is unfair, since we are comparing a 6-year technology gap) and the controls. The control system itself is fine, but the movement can at times be notoriously difficult as there is no option to move slowly. Also, targeting small enemies can be difficult with firearms weapons at times. These are so minor, that it is not enough to shave a mark off the final score, as this game is near-on perfect. You NEED to play this game, and if you haven\u0027t already, you need to play Half-Life 2 after playing this. Best two games in the world.… ",

This is gonna take a while... from where do I start? I guess I\u0027ll start from the bottom and work my way up to what I enjoy most in the game. Graphics: They were pretty amazing at the time. Even the Source engine (the follow-up of the GoldSrc engine, a heavily modified Quake engine) is struggling to hold up today. But for 1998 standards... there weren\u0027t many truly 3D FPSs games. And Half Life had high quality textures, polygonal models... and the NPCs moved their mouths when they were talking. Even in Max Payne 2 (from 2003) some characters didn\u0027t move their mouths. Of course, Half Life did not age well in the graphics department, but you gotta give it a break. If you compare it with other games at the time (Quake 2, for example), Half Life looks gorgeous. Audio: The voice acting is nice for the time. It could have been better, though -there are only 3 voice actors in the game from what I recall, but the voices are memorable. The monsters, the guns and other sounds don\u0027t disappoint also. The soundtrack has some memorable themes, but it is too scarce. There are some great action or exploration moments that could use some background track, but it will only play in a few (very few) moments. Gameplay: The action was fast paced and easy for anyone to try it, but the game didn\u0027t babysit you. The AI of the enemies was really good, and, actually, I think it holds up even for today standards. The marines you fight aren\u0027t brain-dead like many of the enemies of modern shooters. They actually fall back and heal themselves. Sometimes they act really stupid, but most of the time they provide a challenge. The game also had a great pacing, with fast gunplay moments, small fights and exploration parts. And they all feel connected so organically that it\u0027s something I still haven\u0027t seen in any other game. But what really sets the game apart from me are two things: the storytelling and the level design. Story: Actually, the story is pretty dumb. You\u0027re Gordon Freeman, a scientist that kicks alien ass. Hell yeah. But, seriously, there\u0027s nothing more to it. What is amazing is that the game doesn\u0027t take control of the camera at any time. Since you start up the campaign, you see everything by the protagonist\u0027s eye. And each room tells you a story. It\u0027s subtle, but every corner has something to add to the story if you look carefully and try to interpret what is being shown. It\u0027s nothing so much amazing, but it\u0027s awesome by the way that this is achieved. Level design: I don\u0027t even know what to say. The level design contributes to the storytelling, bringing the universe of the Black Mesa Research Facility alive. But it doesn\u0027t sacrifice the gameplay. In fact, it makes the whole experience more enjoyable, because each level has its own motif going on, and each one is focused in one type of gameplay. Some levels are more action packed, others have more puzzles. But they don\u0027t feel disjointed at any time. Only the last levels are kind of a bore, but they\u0027re not necessarilly bad. They just don\u0027t hold up to the other levels. So, yeah, I talked too much and I didn\u0027t even scrape the surface of what I wanted to talk. But you should at least take a look at the game. It deserves it, as the \"uncle\" of modern titles. And if you never played the original and think that it\u0027s too old, take a look at the free mod called Black Mesa, that is a remake of the original game. It\u0027s amazing too. So, yeah, Half Life... give it a try when you can, really.… ",

No other FPS game at the time had a decent enough story, proper voice acting and a realistic atmosphere but Half-Life did that and it became a game that would still be played to this day and was so successful it sprung a sequel. Half Life really is a brilliant game, not in its ageing graphics, not in its poor voice acting but how good it is gameplay wise. Plot Summary: You are a scientist called Gordon Freeman you work at a top secret facility called Black Mesa Research Facility. Today you have a special experiment. You enter the test chamber, As you place the specimen into the scanning beam it all goes wrong. Aliens start teleporting all over the facility and kill anything they see Gordon takes matters into his own hands, for his own survival. Gameplay: You have a range of weapons under you disposal all the weapons in Half-Life have a good use, unlike most FPS games. There are plenty of clever puzzles which most FPS games lacked, even now FPS games don\u0027t have proper puzzles. A useful addition is the duck jump which is used well in Half-Life. These additions were very welcoming considering the usual find a key next door and then the next door to the exit. But this was a more realistic approach. Switching a fire chamber on to burn a giant monster, turning on a generator to electrocute a big alien this is the kind of thing FPS was hungry for and Half-Life proved that adding these environments and goals would make a realistic, puzzling atmosphere. Music: There is not much of a musical score in Half-Life in fact there is not theme song. But when you do hear a song in game, its tense or a fast paced action song. AI: The AI was perfect for the day and there still hold up good today but the AI really was clever in Half-Life which most FPS lacked back in the day. Conclusion should I buy it or not? The answer is obviously yes! Without a doubt Half-Life is truly a fantastic game. Its a must have! You will have a very nostalgic and fulfilling adventure you have ever had from a FPS game. Its a great classic that still holds up today it has everything a FPS needs you will not be disappointed.I rate it a solid... 10/10… ",

No se engañen, mi playtime es aparentemente poco porque no fue sino hasta hace unos días que finalmente compré el juego en steam, sin embargo, tengo más de diez años jugándolo constántemente. Podría ponerme a listar la serie de elementos que hacen a HL1 una obra maestra absoluta del pc-gaming, sin embargo este análisis se prolongaría demasiado. Para evitar dicho exceso me limitaré a mencionar los elementos que el juego graba en la memoria a través de un diseño increíblemente exquisito y elegante. El level design es una maravilla, no sólo por las diferentes capas de verticalidad fotorrealista que dotan a Black Mesa de una sensación de plausibilidad sumamente difícil de encontrar en los videojuegos, sino por la ilusión de continuidad. Half-Life está segmentado por capítulos, dichos capítulos llevan al jugador a través de la mayoría del complejo (quedarían zonas sin explorar que serían retro-conectadas a través de las expansiones) continuas, separadas por pantallas de carga de apenas unos segundos y manteniendo el escenario tal y cómo el jugador lo había dejado tras su paso, no sólo abarcando los objetos sino los mismísimos patrones de la inteligencia artificial. Esto me lleva al siguiente punto: La inteligencia artificial en Half-Life ha sido galardonada a lo largo de la historia por crear escuela en cuanto a AI Design, ejemplos notables de esta filosofía de diseño siendo el primer F.E.A.R., juego con un indiscutiblemente bien conseguido feel muy similar a las interacciones emergentes propuestas por Half-Life. Además de esta sofisticada capacidad para la interacción emergente de las distintas inteligencias artificiales, cada patrón de comportamiento tiene características similares que dotan al mundo de un realismo impresionante. Desde cucarachas atraídas a los restos por un sistema de hedor, hasta los Houndeyes utilizando un sencillo pero eficaz (e impresionante de observar) sistema de manada; me atrevería a decir que es Half-Life el shooter lineal más inmersivo de la historia precisamente por ese amor al detalle puesto a cada una de las entidades del juego. Y finalmente, la historia. Marc Laidlaw relata la escalofriante travesía de un físico teórico egresado del MIT con guiños al terror clásico de diferentes escuelas, pasando por el cosmohorror más lovecraftiano, hasta el worldbuilding al estilo King (Marc Laidlaw afirma haber bebido directamente de la famosa novela The Mist para la concepción intelectual de Black Mesa) y la ciencia ficción pulp de los años cincuenta. Cero cinemáticas. Cero exposición. Un buen gusto que acojona. Qué más decir de esta obra maestra. Juégalo, regala todas las copias que puedas y paga precio completo si estás dispuesto, veinte años después el juego sigue valiéndolo. Un diez de diez inmejorable. (Publicada originalmente como Handsome Shrek a través de mi perfil de Steam el 25 de Diciembre del 2017)… ",

Я его прошел 4-5 месяцев назад, для меня было сложно адаптироваться ведь я продукт нового поколения игр, я еще дурак на самой сложной сложности играл, мучался, сейвился по кд рассчитывал боеприпасы патронов. Тут кстати очень большой арсенал оружия и все они пригодятся да и всеми ими стрелять очень приятно. Вообщем о чем я, игра пиздатая. Каждый уважающий себя GaMeR должен пройти халву. Поговорим о длс: Адриан - заебись но там какая то хернюшка была которая меня бесила но я уже не помню склероз, спасибо вкусно гирбокс Барни - спасибо вкусно но что то с прыжками не то Ко-оп - поиграл с медведсом в ко-оп было пиздато но она очень легкая потому что была сделана для консолей, концовка хуета… ",

Mais il faut dire que ce premier Half-Life propose une véritable histoire et pose de véritables questions qui motivent sans cesse le joueur à poursuivre son \"aventure\" ; en même temps, il distille quelques réponses qui amènent d\u0027autres interrogations et ainsi de suite jusqu\u0027au 2 puis jusqu\u0027aux 2 épisodes addtionnels... Et c\u0027est comme ça et c\u0027est pour ça qu\u0027on attend toujours Half-Life 3... du moins certains et certains autres qui croient encore au père Noël ou aux soucoupes volantes. Personnellement, j\u0027ai déjà donné (non pas aux soucoupes... quoique avec le père Mulder) de mon temps au Half-Life en son temps et si j\u0027ai été saisi immédiatement par cette maîtrise de la narration, du tempo et des évènements, j\u0027ai aussi subi avec mauvaise humeur pas mal des tics du jeu... C\u0027est sans doute à la fois une qualité et un défaut par exemple que de ne jamais lâcher la pression sur le joueur -ou à peine le temps de faire une pause- puis de le faire repartir au turbin, un décidément très sale boulot où l\u0027on ne sait jamais ce qui va nous tomber sur le coin de la gueule... Il faut aussi réfléchir un brin pour se sortir de situations délicates et jouer à saute-mouton et/ou sauter sur des plate-formes et en plus, en plus... gérer ces sauts \"longs\" très casse-burnes. Ou gérer ses munitions selon les armes, car on manque toujours de munitions dans Half-Life, car ça \"augmente la tension\" dit-on ! Or le jeu est déjà assez flippant comme ça... Comme ces crabes qui te sautent à la gueule du début à la fin du jeu, ou la fin elle-même bien pénible (qui a eu raison de mes nerfs, là je crois) ou bien les **** bâtards qui se téléportent derrière toi... ou bien les forces d\u0027intervention qui viennent en remettre une couche (encore une !) rien que pour toi ! comme si le monde entier qui part en morceaux n\u0027était pas déjà suffisant pour \"t\u0027occuper\"...! Intéressant donc le Half-Life mais également énervant et stressant. Hypnotisant, addictif aussi mais très fatigant... Aujourd\u0027hui je ne pourrais plus le refaire, ça me casserait les couilles en moins de deux. Et puis le gameplay a vieilli... on ne veut plus d\u0027aventure linéaire aussi longue même si on salue avec le recul cette mise en scène et ces scripts si inventifs pour l\u0027époque !… ",

Story: you\u0027re name is Gordon freeman and you are an everyday scientist thrust into a grand inter dimensional conflict and your only real goal is survival. sure the story concept sounds good but characters die or are silent, witch is where the game shows its age . sometimes silent protagonists work if you can have them emote in other ways like more recently doom guy in the doom remakes or facial reactions like in legend of zelda. still for the time the story is really good it just hasn\u0027t aged the best but even still i think world building was the games best strength not its story Story:7.5/10 world building: creating an interesting world that your game takes place in is the actual anti ageing solution to keeping a game relevant ( star wars did it for film ) and half-life was not the first one to make an interesting world but it was the first one to do it this well. most of the story telling is environmental everything you learn about black messa is from exploring it at first the scientists seem innocent and will act innocent because they don\u0027t see them selves as having done anything wrong, all the creatures feel like they have their own spot on the food chain and having a lot of different human npcs really helps the worldbuilding as well , with different factions the world feels more than just yours and that makes it feel bigger than the black messa facility. World building 10/10 Graphics: for its time the game looks great, hell it still looks fairly good today. the animations are slick but a little to the point. the guns look great and are rendered in a detail that makes you able to recognize what real life guns they actually are, the partical effects , and even lighting are really good for their time the only thing that\u0027 really shows its age graphically are the models they are all ridged and blocky. Graphics:8/10 Game play: honestly this was the worst part of the game. it feels less like a game and more like a performance witch i suppose it emulates action movies, you pretty much have to traverse some parts perfectly or else you will not make it and it makes it even worst if you got in a bad save, this was frustrating at best and infuriating at worst. now i know its partially my fault but you basically have no room for error witch give this game a steep learning curve. things were easy to spot levels were designed in such a way i rarely got stuck on what to do next witch i find with old games is a something that happens a lot i did need to look up walkthroughs but mostly how am i to tackle combat encounters and not where to go. gameplay: 8/10 Sound design: the music was good at its best and forgettable at its worst. the music is brings a mood to where you are and for most of black messa it feels like industrial rock and industrial sounds and the last few missions just sound like demonic gospel witch is fitting. guns sound snappy and crunchy and are really satisfying. explosions sound incredible. this is the earliest video game voice acting id consider good. lines are delivered really well and i didn\u0027t notice any awkward inconstancy in the acting Sound design: 7.5/10 7.5+10+8+8+7.5\u003d41 41/5\u003d 8.2/10 Half life is a great game , despite its age and i think people should experience even if they don\u0027t understand its technological push there is enough world building to keep people interested. but i can see that the age is enough to keep people at bay but id like to tell peoople despite this game being 21 years old. its very much worth the less than 5 dollars i payed for it comeing with the valve complete pack that goes on sale alot witch means you can get this game and its spin offs and sequel(s) for dirt cheap.… ",

(AND I KNOW THAT SOME PEOPLE WHO READ THIS WOULD HATE ME FOR THIS) but Half-Life was a huge disappointing game in my opinion and a really bad game. I have to admit in a positive way that even that the story is not ground breaking or anything like that, it was a huge improvement into storytelling, all the game\u0027s plot was shown via \"scripted sequences\" and this made useless the need of use pre-rendered cutscenes or cutscenes in general, so the players don\u0027t loose the immersion that this world has build playing as one of the most iconic video game characters. It\u0027s a shame that the gameplay in general is... well... bad. Let\u0027s begun with the combat, one of the very first weapons that the player got their hands off was the iconic crowbar, but... melee combat is awful in this game, it is good to break crates and glasses but combat totally no. Fire weapons are so inconsistent in their damage rate, like, how is it possible that a pistol is more powerful than an assault rifle? or a shotgun? the best gun is the magnum revolver, unfortunately ammunition for this gun is really scarce, this gun is literally one shot kill. Enemies are annoying, specially those little alien things that zombies had in their heads, those things appear out of nowhere and can inflict a lot of damage, and the soldiers too, those guys are bullet sponges!!!. In this game you will die a lot, but you die in the most unfair ways possible and this end of feeling like a really cheap move to make the game feels \"challenging\". Even that the levels are lineal, and the game\u0027s nature is lineal as well, I end being lost a lot of times wondering \"what am i suppose to do now?\" there\u0027s no objectives tab or anything like that, you have to interact with NPC\u0027s that will give hints to were to go next, a good addition from this NPC\u0027S is that some can be useful to unlock some doors or even help you in combat, but they die quickly, even more that what you could expected. Platforming sections are terrible and it\u0027s a good example of why platforming and First Person Shooters usually don\u0027t get along, and the game\u0027s implementation of boxes with physics... are awful (good thing this was fixed in the second game). Half-Life is indeed an iconic game from the late 90s and calling it the worst game would be fair or perhaps it wouldn\u0027t be a very accurate statement. The game isn\u0027t entirely that bad as i made it look, it had it\u0027s moments of glory, but still, calling it a masterpiece... well, it\u0027s not masterpiece. Half-Life is a most have game or even one of the game you should play before dying, give it a try, master game, learn it\u0027s combat pasterns and you will have a really satisfying experience.… ",

The game eschews the use of cutscenes or narrative text, telling an unfolding story through the eyes of the voiceless scientist Gordon Freeman. While this style of cinematic storytelling is commonplace these days, in 1998, it was revolutionary. The game begins as you arrive to work (late) via a subway tram. It seems to be just another day on the job until the experiment you run goes horribly wrong and Earth is overrun by vicious aliens. As Freeman, you will navigate your way through the extremely large and complex Black Mesa complex, battling a variety of enemies and obstacles. Each level has a distinctly different central mechanic and theme, and the action never cuts away: the game is one long set piece, and this makes it all seem extremely real, even to this day. Half-Life’s pacing is nearly perfect: after overcoming a certain type of combat encounter or series of obstacles, the game makes sure to mix things up or transition before you get too bored of it, for the most part. The major exceptions to this are an extremely long outdoor combat segment (which was still exciting throughout but had me anxious for the next level) and the penultimate chapter, which honestly felt like a slog compared to the rest of the game. The game smartly alternates between intriguing platforming sections and charged combat situations, both of which have aged very well (for the most part) and are appropriately challenging. The game is also incredibly creative with combat. You’ll have to stealthily avoid the tentacles of a cranky alien beast, lure a large, menacing creature into an electric trap, and take potshots at enemies while riding down a high-speed rail cart. Every new chapter offers something fresh and exciting. Even in 2019, the combat in Half-Life is frantic and appetizing. The more typical weapons pack a punch and give satisfactory feedback, while you’re treated to an array of more interesting weapons such as a couple experimental science-y guns, a homing rocket launcher, an alien limb, and a disturbingly manic beetle.. Despite everything great about Half-Life, it is far from perfect, especially in the current age of video gaming. As breathtaking as most of the game is, the pacing really suffers towards the end, as mentioned above. I was glad to get to the final boss encounter, but I did find it pretty frustrating compared to everything that came before. There’s very little margin for error, here. I would not say it was a complete letdown, but it was not the most enjoyable end to the game. On the gameplay mechanics end of things, ladders can be a little sketchy: you may be quite certain you are on a ladder when the game thinks you aren’t, causing you to plummet to your death. Crouch-jumping is also somewhat awkward (by nature, honestly). Finally, not being able to quick-switch your weapons is pretty inconvenient: you’re forced to use the mouse wheel to switch between them, and then click again to select a weapon. Aside from these minor quibbles, Half-Life is still a near-perfect and phenomenal first-person experience. It’s mind-blowing how well it stands up today, and I felt no lack of excitement and emotion playing through it decades later.… ",

Figuring out how to progress to the next area is very rewarding. Small flaws: -crosshair can be hard to see -one save game crash, otherwise ran smoothly on windows 10 Bought for $1, played 12 hours, highly recommended.",
