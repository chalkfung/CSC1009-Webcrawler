This is a game where you would see Source\u0027s great engine during 2004, with realistic physics mechanics, best graphics during 2004, outstanding level designs, and realistic facial muscles which makes the G-Man like a real person. Half-Life 2\u0027s level design is amazing. Of-course, the part where you experiment with the engine\u0027s physics and use them to get to your objective, Use those rolling blades to kill those zombies at Ravenholm; It makes you feel like your smarter than you actually are. That\u0027s what makes the game so great. Half-Life 2\u0027s dialogue is top-notch. Half-Life 2\u0027s dialogue actually makes sense to the story, important characters tell you what\u0027s going on, and references to Half-Life 1, to make it even more sense. Not like something that sounds cool but doesn\u0027t make sense to the story you are currently playing, and Not something that sounds boring. Half-Life 2\u0027s modding support. Ah yes, the modding support, which brings me to Steam. Well Steam made Half-Life 2 modding support now possible, you can now create source mods for the game, or seperate mods that you could just download for free on the Steam Store, well if you have the game of course. If you have are a necrophiliac and enjoy this game aswell, you can download mods to fit your fetishes. There are legendary mods like: MMod which makes Half-Life 2\u0027s gameplay even more modern, and graphical improvements. (highly suggest trying MMod.) The story is even great. Half-Life 2\u0027s story gives a great example of what more FPS games should create, not something that sounds too boring, or something that doesn\u0027t even make sense. Alyx, Kleiner, Barney, Eli, Mossman, and other characters in the game does an amazing job in each character\u0027s personality. Conclusion. The game is outstanding, it was way ahead of it\u0027s time, with very cool graphics, realistic physics and facial animations, and great dialogue into the game. The story is interesting and fun to see and learn, with endless characters making a icon into the game and definitely deserved a perfect cliffhanger for the Half-Life series. I wish I could rate this 11/10, it\u0027s just too perfect in my eyes.… ",

First of all, I am not hating this game just to hate (hell, at least I gave it a 3). Second, I am taking all the hype for this game out of the equation. Graphics: I honestly felt like I got a beta version of the game when I started it and saw the very basic (borderline texture starter kit) and dry textures. The guns didn\u0027t look too bad but everything else looked like it hadn\u0027t even started rendering (yes I played the game on Ultra settings). Concept: put a gun in front of the screen, give an invisible entity a name, and have people tell it to do stuff only to always be interrupted mid sentence by enemies and never find out what they were going to say. Valve tried to give Freeman no personality or dialog so that the player could relate with him but the outcome was the exact opposite. It felt like just controlling a floating gun with zero personality. Story: The biggest confusion for me was how much people praised this game\u0027s story line. You literally start the game with many questions from the last game and are only given more questions. The G-Man spouts off nonsense and makes it seem like it\u0027s important and you wake up in god knows where in the future (no clue as to how many years because the game never specifies). No one is shocked in the least to see you after so many years looking the exact same you did when they last saw you and they ask you to go from point A to point B for no good reason. That last sentence is literally the entire story. One full game and two 3 hour episodes with absolutely no story progression except for the end of episode 2, and even that isn\u0027t that great because you had no emotion ties to the character who dies. People will constantly defend this and say \"Valve will eventually explain the story. Just give them time\". Why? Why judge a games story based on what your assumptions are? That\u0027s not innovative, that\u0027s sloppy writing. AI: I never even knew this was something that was seen as something great about this game until after I beat it........ so I have no idea why it\u0027s praised. Enemies act like enemies (in annoyingly low numbers and way too weak (even on hard)). Alyx is uncomfortable with how she acts with a guy who is probably twice her age and is actually quite annoying pointing out everything that happens in front of you. Replay Value: None. The game is linear with nothing on the side to keep it entertaining. Physics Engine: similar to the AI, I didn\u0027t even know this was something that was looked at as innovative. A physics engine should not determine a games worth especially when it\u0027s only used to have you \"solve\" kindergarten puzzles or to encourage you to use a weapon (Gravity Gun) that was boring and useless right after its tutorial. Conclusion: this entire game felt like a students project for an indie game. No story, no atmosphere, bad dialog, slow paced, confusing for the sake of being confusing, and has a complete lack of feeling like any work was done with it. This game was very underground when it came out (mostly because pc gaming wasn\u0027t as big in 2004) and so most of its original praise is from the, for the lack of a better word, hipsters that played this game. In essence, this game is a hipster game. It\u0027s a hipster game because it\u0027s full of things that normally wouldn\u0027t be seen as good but it\u0027s praised for those things so people jump on the bandwagon (similar with Stanley Parable). This actually only a small fraction of what I can say about this game but I am not about to write three reviews for one game.… ",

Even in 2011, seven years after its initial release, I am still reminded why Half-Life 2 is one of the greatest first-person shooters of all time. Not the greatest, but definitely one of them. I think the greatest strength in Half-Life 2 (gameplay-wise) is the level design. Over the course of I believe 14 levels, you see an incredible variation in locale, level structure, lighting, and gameplay. This is complimented by such a flux in mood, intensity, and immersion that you can\u0027t help but to just be enthralled by it. For instance, the entire first 3 chapters of the game is a slow build-up to an intense climax. You start as a fugitive, running across the rooftops of City 17 to escape the Combine Overwatch. You are allowed to take a short, 10-minute breather in a safe-haven, then thrust back into the bowels of the city\u0027s sewer system, and finally driving your own airboat through the canals. It\u0027s such a gradual build you hardly notice it, until you reach the end of the climax, discover you\u0027ve been holding your breath for the past 30 seconds, and that you\u0027ve been maintaining a white-knuckled grip on your mouse this whole time. And that\u0027s the first 3 chapters. After this you are treated to some incredibly creepy locations, and some more intense escapes/shootouts. All the atmosphere is enhanced with some pretty incredible performances both animation- and voice-acting-wise, even if you consider that this is 2011. And wow, the voice acting. These are some of the most incredible video game characters to this date. Immensely believable, highly emotional, subtly expressive, the characters help suck you right into the story and world that Valve created, and you could almost be fooled into thinking they are actually talking to you... Oh and that reminds me, the story. Okay, so it\u0027s not laid out for you word-for-word what\u0027s going on, or what relevance all these characters have in terms of the story from the instance you set foot into the game. I have read a lot of reviews and seen a lot of complaints. Yes, Valve did not flesh it out in its entirety in the first chapter. No, you pretty much don\u0027t have a clue what kind of influence the combine and the G-Man are right from the word go. But to be honest, I don\u0027t care. When it comes to story-telling, I personally enjoy the opportunity to discover the story for myself, and not just have it told to me if I were a five-year-old. There are some pretty subtle hints laying around concerning backstory, main storyline, and intertwining character plots. If you look for them, you\u0027ll find that this is actually some interesting sci-fi, more driven by characters (which it should be) than by what\u0027s necessary to pluck a plot twist out of your ass. So overall, the story ended up being a plus in my opinion. Other than that, the graphics are still good, though a bit dated, physics are awesome, and the gravity gun continues to be the best weapon in the history of gaming, Go Valve! Now I just can\u0027t wait until my Portal 2 pre-load finishes...… ",

However taken with a grain of salt the game (like most popular historical games) is over hyped due to the mystery of half life 3 and the nostalgia it brings to many. Gameplay: The game does a great job of incorporating puzzles without it being too obvious forcing you to think and use your mind without hand holding. The shooting is good but I admit having only a crossbow with a zoom is a bit annoying, I get that modern games make it too easy with every gun having a scope but none is a downer. Some of the difficulty also just becomes annoying at times instead of challenging, I found part of this mainly to do w/the graphics/lighting making it hard to see what you need to do. Graphics: Stand the test of time and makes you think less of modern games that they have not improved more. Story: This was my biggest complaint. I understand there is half life 1 and the half life 2 episodes but standing alone the story is not good. It is not clearly explained when only a little summary here and there would make it better. You do not really have a purpose in the game as you are just directed from point A to point B helping a resistance (but not with any goal or objective). You should not have to read wikis and time lines and history of things to understand the story of a game. Gameplay: 4/5 Graphics: 5/5 Story: 2/5… ",

And I can tell that I\u0027ve played many games since I was a teenager, but Half Life 2 is just a very immersive game for me which drove me deep into the post-apocalyptic world once again with no disappointment. The game has it\u0027s unique story with very cool and interesting characters. It has great character Alex, which is one of the best female characters in gaming in my personal view. The graphics is still impressive and there is no cheap feeling as with many other games, even modern ones. Of course game has great overall design and believable world which expanded just perfectly from the first Half Life. It has very good combination of story scenes and shooting/action scenes which is hard to do for many developers of the games. There is a pretty standard arsenal of weapons but also few unique ones. Such as famous crowbar and a gravity gun, which is very fun. Game has it\u0027s physics based puzzles and maps where you can beat the enemies with no actual weapons which is very cool. There are vehicle and vessel which can be used in the game and it\u0027s a bonus to the great experience. After replaying it of course I\u0027ve seen more and more things that should\u0027ve been improved or made better even at the time of release. For example every area in the game has it\u0027s limits where you can go, do or see. I also wish there where more puzzles or more interesting areas to visit, but the game quite short in length. Overall it\u0027s all very far from ruining the total greatness of the game, in my opinion. One thing to mention though I wish the game was actually finished after next Half Life 2 Episodes, but unfortunately what we have in 2017 is a script from the writer and tones of half life 3 memes, which is pity. Excellent game, though.… ",

I have paid $60 for the silver edition which includes CS Source, HL2, DOD Source, and HL1 Source. I can already say that the $60 is worth CS source alone. every item can be interacted with realistically. you can bust up computers in the office map and see the parts spill out. the best thing is that bullet holes stay there, dont just dissapear. the game looks sooo much nicer. then there is gonna be HL1 Source, the remake of the best game ever made. If you\u0027ve played HL think that with the HL2 graphics and physics. thats saying ALOT. Then DOD source. Although this is only in early development and wont be out for some time, the idea of all the DOD maps redone just make chills go down my spine. dod_forest actually looking like a real forest? yes, its true. Oh yeah.......then there is HL2 itself. Im not gonna get into this but if you dont know about it take a look at the website and see why its the most anticipated game of all time. the fact that those 4 games are only $60 total is the most insane thing and i hereby declare HL2 the BEST GAME EVER with THE BEST VALUE TOO.… ",

It\u0027s basically a better version of every other FPS. Quite an accomplishment but only to the FPS genre. Not to mention it\u0027ll cost you a few hundred bucks to upgrade your computer if you wanna run it.",

I can only get phone modem connection in the country and needless to say it took some time. Not even Microsoft does this to its customers.

In the end, this game sucks as did Doom 3... I wish people out there quit hyping up games like this. When Far Cry came out it was a real revelation and that\u0027s the way it should be.

HL was alot better in terms of innovations, puzzles, challenges. one weapon missing from HL2 arsenal is the strategic trip-laser-mine. why is it left out in HL2? HL2 puzzles are contrived. contrived to demonstrate the physics abilities of the game engine. ramps for the airboat? who place them there? surely not the combine who must be stationed there to stop rebels? antlion sand-traps? oh my, are we having fun \u0027walking\u0027 about with metal doors? yawn. then there\u0027s the countless crates freeman must destroy! oh the humanity! and what is inside these big boxes but one single clip or couple of litty bitty things. who left these around? the rebels? why didn\u0027t the combine who \u0027own\u0027 the place clear it up? a few nice touches were when rebels throws freeman stuff/supplies! the countless explosive-barrels! how conveniently place near combine troopers for freeman to pick off. the countless barrels! are the level-designer somewhat confused? while the levels do not seemed like levels because the environment/architecture is convincingly real the gameplay suggest an arcade shooter. there are places were if freeman do not rush the \u0027nest\u0027 of combine they don\u0027t stop pouring out. scripts and why they are bad. that said it all actually. more scripts\u003dmore movie like but this is a game...remember? the things that happened by scripts/triggers MUST seem incidental or a direct cause of player\u0027s actions. the player in real-time causes stuff to happen, thus the joys of interacting with the game-world. like closing a door would stop a dumb flesh-zombie from entering. if the game-world pretends to be the real-world then everything should be happening simultaneously at will. the arrival of an interactive-agent, you, would immediately begin to cause effects on the environment and NPCs but thru AI not scripts. bad scripts example: it is somewhat odd dog knew to open a gap BEFORE freeman knew he had no where else to go? or if you reload a segment over and over the scripts played like a broken record? this indicate poor AI to AI interactions and AI to player interactions. Scripts are cheap and their novelty wears thin fast. scripts are much too linear, just like HL2 game/level design. exploration and wondering around is discouraged. there are a few \u0027secret\u0027 places to find for rewards but freeman was just being strung along. HL2 didn\u0027t try to be rainbow6. the squad you \"command\" are just as dumb. they mill about blocking your way or utter polite \u0027sorrys\u0027 and try to get out of your way. they cannot obey a simple (of two) command to stay out of trouble. while they seem to admire freeman they just never listen to him for long. there are so many thing poorly done with HL2 that it felt rush. very abrupt ending. instead of a scientist caught in something way, way over his head which he must overcome in HL, freeman becomes little more than a puppet-on-a-string. the mysterious G-Man acts mysterious, like a angel or devil nearby but not involved other than to have this condensening tone of speech. one just expected much more from valve but it does not materialize. the only thing that did was the G-man, at the end to stop the show... HL2 is merely counting on existing HL-fans and not trying to win new ones, not with short gameplay (someone \u0027compress\u0027 gameplay to about 3-4hrs), not with low replayability (if you knew what you knew you would play it over and over again because each time it is a little different or just as fun), not with weak (copied and mixed up from originals like 1984, aliens, resident evil/zombie flicks/starship-troopers/matrix) story line, not with steam. much like when valve came out of HL little known newcomer Far Cry does a good job (it is also linear but you can take your own sweat-time) surpassing kings of the hill - the Doom and HL series... ok for all high-raters, play it again sam? then rate it again.… ",

Driving under the docks and knocking out the supports, Ravenholm being scarier than Doom 3, the GG being able to pick up anything and hurtling it... etc. The fact is I played this game and didn\u0027t feel that electricity and near ecstacy that other people felt. For most of the game I felt like I was being advertised to for this great new engine Valve has created. Instead of \"OMG THAT WAS AN AWESOME MOMENT!\" it was \"alright- i solved your puzzle using your engine... now what?\" The most fantastic moments I had during this game had nothing to do with the engine. Commanding a group of aliens and attacking a Combine base, throwing a grenade behind a wall and watching bodies go flying just before whipping out my shotgun and blasting my way through a group of enemies. Half Life 2 does nothing new in the genre- it is simply an improvement on the physics games like UT2k4 have given us while giving us some awesome action. This is definitely not the \"end all\" that gamers were promised, but somehow the PC hype machine managed to make it so.

The single player is nothing more than a tech demo. Wow, Steam is great. Now get back to work on actual games. The game is overly scripted, with little to no creativity allowed in how you decide to play the game. Games like Far Cry at least partially allowed you to explore other ways of getting your mission accomplished. The feel of the game is simply hollow. You have an environment that you can interact with, but most of the time, do nothing with except solve a few rather simpleminded puzzles. Even with the AI companions it feels lifeless. It\u0027s really like playing an unfinished alpha of a game. Games like Max Payne feel much more lifelike with a storyline (yes, storyline) woven in with the gameplay. With HL2, you\u0027re not really building up any decent plot, not meeting new characters (with any sort of frequency that break what seem to be incredibly long dry spells of unimaginative gameplay), or even building up your suit or weapons. You feel like you are, quite literally, just shuffling yourself from Point A to Point B for most of the game. There are other games that deserve a 97. Half-Life 2 isn\u0027t one of them. Not even close.… ",

Overall I enjoyed this game, but feel the overhyped accolades by most review sites are caused by their fear of not fitting in. The game falls flat on the absolute linearity of the gameplay. There\u0027s only one way to go. It is so well done that I didn\u0027t mind it for the most part, but there is really no ingenuity involved to play the game. You just slog from one sequence to another. Still a pretty good game that would be much better without Steam.… ",

Firslty, steam is a pain. Secondly, the game is too linear. So lets deal with this. On steam, its a pain, and in my opinion, for good reason. Piracy and illegal downloading is rife and while we may secretly indulge in a spot of less than legal activities when it comes to digital copyrights, we have to respect the concerns of the company. Why should they put up with people stealing their game? The system needs to be cleaned up true, but it is necessary. And personally I haven\u0027t found steam to be too troublesome. But the biggest potential criticism is the linear gameplay. Now there are two types of FPS out there really. There are those that are simply linear, and there are those that try to provide the player with freedom. Now personally I fidn that freedom of choice in games is an illusion in most cases, unless we are only talking about what type of weapon etc. In most cases your path is already determined, and only the storyline is affected. But if this is a big issue for you then you won\u0027t like HL2 And the fact is that you should already know this. The whole point of HL is to provide a movie like experience. There is a trade off between scirpting and freedom of gameplay. To make the whole thing more movie like, scritping is needed, otherwise the environment will become static. This comes at the cost of raw freedom of movement etc. Given that HL2 is full of scripting, the complaint that there isnt any freedom appears to be valid. But is it a problem? When you watch a movie, do you complain that you can\u0027t control the main character? This is how you should view HL2 for maximum enjoyment: you have the priviledge of being the main character in an amazing film. This is what HL1 did and unsurprisingly this is what HL2 does. To change it into some sort of free-roaming game would change the essense of the game, and no one would like that. The second argument against non-linear gameplay is that it increases the workload of the developers dramatically, so they have to cut down on the total length of the game. Now in my opinion HL2 is already too short, so anything less than this would reduce my score greatly. As for other smaller criticisms I have heard, most were minor gripe, but one in particular annoyed me. It seems some poeple are disappointed with the character expressions. This is incredibly unfair if you just comapre HL2\u0027s characters to what you find in other games, where developers have spent more time getting the exact way that people die right than the way people talk. I have given the game a score of 8, due to the short length, but if by the time you read this there is sufficient mod support, feel free to consider the score a 9 or even a 10, depending on the strength of the mods.… ",

I\u0027ll also say that I played it on the hardest setting yet there were very few occasions when I had to scavenge for ammo or health, there always seemed to be enough if you were prepared to look for it. Yes the game is linear but its a story and I can\u0027t imagine how (or why) you would want to play it with full freedom, it would just take too long. There is one scene where you need to find two batteries in order to open a barricade. As a test I used the gravity gun to eject a battery over the cliff face - I turned around and saw another battery fall out of thin air back to its original spot...so bascially you can\u0027t just do anything you want otherwise the game wouldn\u0027t progress. Speaking of which, the gravity gun was an ingenious inclusion in the game, it just made yet another FPS a lot more interesting. Moving tables about to shield yourself, or throwing petrol drums at guards was pretty cool in my books. Not as great as the original but it was a solid game with lovely gameplay and worth every cent.… ",

Plain and simple; would you like to put six years of your life into a game, perfecting, working, develloping a game that is in all ways a master piece to have it stolen mby some college grad with a computer steal it, use it, play it without ever playing? does that sound just to you? Also as to the AI? on hard the ai is very smart, i once popped out a door, then saw four or five CP soldiers and a strider, then ran back inside and waited for them to come and attack me... one ran through the door.... shotgun to the head! I expected more to come through pop \u0027em off one by one, not going to happen... a nade comes through... i jumped behind a table that flew into me and hurt me... then again i waited.. the strider crouched down and looked into the doorway charged its beam and fired! its was impressive i closed the door and blocked it up with a few tables and the cps tried to break down the door they couldnt! they smashed the window and started to shoot me they lobbed grenades etc! this was NOT SCRIPTED!!! i tried it more than once... it happened differenly each time (including one time that then shot the boxes to break them and then kicked open the door,) Ok, last thing... i think people who say that the phsysics are stupid and that there are games with better graphics than Half-Life 2, Ok you are on crack... or have been hit in the head one too many times with a real crowbar... There is no game that can compare.... Far cry? Lol yah... right I own that game..

No, seriously, I give it a \"10\" because it\u0027s the most immersive game I\u0027ve ever played, and that state is achieved by an incredible attention to detail. It\u0027s like you\u0027re right there in the scene and I don\u0027t know of any other game that can truly make that claim (yes, I know there are some that *say* they can, but IMO they can\u0027t). I do have some reservations about the much-praised facial contortions--for the most part these are great, but there\u0027re some lapses. Dr. Breen is a good example. His facial expressions/gestures and voice don\u0027t quite synch up. Robert Culp\u0027s a great choice to voice unctuousness, though--I get such a kick listening to his oily voice on the various broadcasts and then, when I can\u0027t take it any more, using the Ggun to rip the console out of the wall and smash it. Apart from that, people have rightly faulted the so-called helpers (including the antlions, post-\"Highway 17\") and their annoying habit of getting in your way. People have also complained about the ending. I admit at first I didn\u0027t care much for it (\"cheesy\" was my initial reaction) but replaying \"Benefactors\" and \"Dark Energy\" together, I find the sinister atmosphere of the Citadel has kind of grown on me. The only thing about that last part I didn\u0027t like is having to rely for most of the time only on the Enhanced GravityGun. The fun of HL2 (as in HL1, only not as much) is weapon swapping, discovering to your delight that you forgot, say, that the crossbow could do so much long-range damage or that the best weapon against fast-moving zombies is sometimes the good old crowbar. In the last two levels, it\u0027s just blast, suck stuff up, and/or throw it. It gets old, quickly. All around, this game has significantly upped the standards we expect of FPSers and everyone, even those who aren\u0027t impressed with the game, should be thankful for that.… ",

The graphics are, of course, to die for - you can turn the detail down and it still looks like Jesus himself created the characters. The voice acting is brilliant - I have to give a quick nod to Valve for the subtitles and closed-captions...finally the deaf can enjoy Half-Life as much as the hearing can. Thanks for that. There is one, only one, downside, and it begins with S. There really is no way around it, but once you\u0027ve got the game, you can apparently switch Steam off without downloading something claiming to be a crack which actually eats your computer from the inside like a tapeworm - have a look on Google for the tweak.

I felt that was something all games were missing. Not only do all the characters move with the full range of emotions that almost makes the game like a movie, but you can make your own animations too! And I\u0027ve seen some that kicked ass, no less. And physics...DON\u0027T GET ME STARTED! Physics not only make all the gunshots and explosions so much cooler to watch, but it actually brings up a whole slew of new ways to attack enemies. An expert may look down at a new player and say \"You just left that splintered piece of wood BEHIND???\" Garry\u0027s Mod is a game in itself, with enough extra visuals and creative methods that bring the engine\u0027s physics to their full extent and back around again. Just go to facepunchstudios.com and see what wonders have been made. When I played Halo, I noticed something - you get lost a lot. A lot of rooms are similar, and I have never ever memorized any portion of a halo level. But Half-Life 2...take just about any screenshot of a level and even someone who only played the game once will look and say \"Oh yeah! I remember that part!\" Every little room has something in it that\u0027s memorable. As for the prequel, let\u0027s just say graphics is probably the smallest of the things they improved.… ",

The cutscenes for Far Cry are short and choppy and the character acting is bad, they do not model how humans really move when they talk (Half Life 2 does and everyone knows it). Far cry would make even Carlos Mencia say \"Nuh na NUuuuUuUh !!!\" The game play sucks so badly that i wonder why i even bought the game. You are supposed to be able to sneak through the jungle and silently kill opponents. Um so why don\u0027t I have a silencer and as far as i know there is no meelee button. Also, why am I such a pansy in Far Cry that i can not even fire my weapon when i am on the surface of the water? If you want a real jungle sneeking game with great story, buy a playstation 2 and get Metal Gear Sold 3. People are also talking about how Half Life 2 is repeatable through certain sections if you play them over and over. My friend died three times at that massive turret on that part where you are taking the airboat to Eli\u0027s and you have to explode the barrels to knock open a gate. Each time he played the section against that combine soldier, the soldier ended up in three different places when my friend crouched behind tha cart and slowly pushed it toward him. On another part when you are escaping the combine in the train tunnels my friend looked down the hallway and saw a combine soldier next to an exploding barrel that was knocked over. He went to the wall to get some health and when he went back to go kill the soldier, we saw him pushing an exploding barrel down the hall towards him. Now i haven\u0027t played doom 3 or quake but what other AI does this? What about the Zombies who through barrels and crates at you? I didn\u0027t expect that. Bottom line is that Half Life 2 has great graphics without compromising performance and all you people need to get off of your Far Cry trip.… ",

I even tried updating the other games include, while my update for HL2 was paused, and they updated with no problem... until they reached 99%, then they stopped. I updated Steam with no problem, to 100%. Personally, I will never buy another game with Steam on the box again. Not until they start offering their downloads through other sites like Cnet download or filefront. I\u0027ve had this game for 3 months and I\u0027ve only been able to play it for 2 weeks. A complete rip-off and total waste of time. It does offer the feature of backing up your files for you (so maybe you could save your progress), but, you guessed it, it won\u0027t let you do that because the game isn\u0027t updated. The good part is, if you do get desperate, you can use the box for toilet paper. I tried using the disk, but I couldn\u0027t download anything to it! A game is no good if you can\u0027t play it.… ",

Call of Duty, Doom 3 and Far Cry are better: Justify it. Doom 3 consists of walking around in darkness waiting for a demon to jump out of a closet at you. There is no strategy. Far Cry is a great game but that doesn\u0027t mean HL2 needs to be rated 0. Call of Duty I \u0026 II? Again, great games but not any better than HL2. A final note, the online play for HL2 is outstanding; deathmatch, counter strike are well supported and have tons of players and maps. The tool kit included with HL2 is excellent, as is the map builder.… ",

And since when does a shooter have to be so in particularly be a completely realistic in an environment of the jungle, or some place on Mars, or some really dumb variation of L.A? (I\u0027m looking at you, Bloodlines.) What happened to the good old shooters like Metal Slug, hm? Sure, they weren\u0027t packed to their necks with plasma decentigration balls, dual powered shotguns, MP7\u0027s, or hoverboats, but what it the issue? Even if you count out the puzzles and map designs (Which, by the way, are practically flawless compared to some of the garbage I\u0027ve seen from Halo and many other First Persons) the gameplay still heads in the correct direction. Then, complaints on the squads and commands; let me address that you don\u0027t even need squads if you\u0027re playing on normal, let alone easy. If just having some rebel guy following you and you press \u0027c\u0027 at the ground in front of you, he\u0027ll go. I found barely any uses of teamwork, with the exception of Grigori or Alyx, the special NPCs. What sort of makes me mad too is the fact people continue to say \u0027this game is overrated\u0027, \u0027this game is behind its time\u0027, \u0027this game is crap no thanks to Steam\u0027, personally, these are whiny comments. First of all, the game would probably not be overrated, if it weren\u0027t for the 2003 hacking. Second, it would not of been behind its time. If I do recall, some companies found part of the coding and used it for their own games. Next to that, the physics engine was remarkable for what it was way back when, when it drove awe into the people who watched E3 and the beta clips. I\u0027m not sure what\u0027s wrong with registering to Steam either: You simply install the game, which takes NOT 4 hours, it takes 10 to 15 minutes before for my old, lousy Dell. Then you register the game, which shouldn\u0027t even take that long, if 3 minutes counts as yet another sarcastic 1 hour. If it takes the person installing Half-Life 2 at least 4 hours, then your computer dates back to the days Half-Life 1 could run on those awesome Pentium 1 Windows 93 computers. And complaining of load times? Get a computer upgrade, stop whining. If you save some money for at least 3 months, you could get a gigabyte of ram and a GeForce 7300 at its cheapest. Enough complaining, it\u0027s time to get on to Half-Life 2, and what it brought, and would of brought to this generation. I applaud Valve for simply releasing this; I was almost doubting a real release at all due to the beta hack. The guns, if I say, are awesome. The MP7 I would delightfully switch with an MP5K anyday, though.… ",

And I have heard the complaints about loading times; I have a Dell XPS 400, and the loading times do not interrupt the game badly at all, although slower computers I can understand. The graphics are good, as are the facial expressions. And everyone\u0027s problem with a linear game: what\u0027s wrong with it? I felt like I was playing in a movie. Also, the fact that one doesn\u0027t see oneself in cutscenes is great, because it makes the player seem as he is the character, rather than some random watching entity. True, the Allied AI does indeed suck. You can send your squad elsewhere, whoop-de-do. However, the enemy AI is amazing, on hard mode. There have been several times when I thought I was safe, but not even my trusty crowbar could save me. The enemy AI runs like soldiers, covering eachother while moving and throwing grenades just for the stun effect. Why can\u0027t the Allied AI be that great? Actually, there is a good reason. The Allies are just civilians with guns and stuff, they aren\u0027t trained soldiers like the Combine.… ",

Steam is hard to use but this game makes up for the long installation times by rewarding you with Counter-Strike: Source, Half-Life 2: Deathmatch, Half-Life: Source, AND Half-Life: Deathmatch. I wouldn\u0027t necessarily say Steam sucks if you get 4 more freakin\u0027 games for buying one awesome FPS. For all of you that say that the graphics are bad, then what\u0027s GOOD? The graphics are incredible in Half-Life 2, with beatiful environments, gorgeous character models, and possibly the best water and glass I\u0027ve ever seen. This isn\u0027t a Pixar movie we\u0027re talking about here, it\u0027s a video game, where lag, glitches, and bugs are an issue, so graphics aren\u0027t going to be photorealistic in a fully interactive world. The weapons are pretty good as well. The gravity gun is reather creative, and the laser-guided RPG is a great twist on a classic weapon. The signature crowbar is extremely fun to use, and who doesn\u0027t want to impale someone on a wall using a crossbow loaded with radioactive bolts. The pheropod could also be the most unique weapon I\u0027ve ever seen in my entire life. The pulse rifle\u0027s secondary fire was also incredibly well done, and the shotgun was incredibly fun to use. The only weapon that didn\u0027t work for me was the grenade, since it takes too long to explode and is a different weapon (they should imply the Halo system were you don\u0027t have to switch weapons to throw grenades). Overall, the weapons were very creative and fantastic. The story was a bit broken, but still managed to be suspenseful and immersive. There were shocking, scary (Ravenholm, I\u0027m looking at you), exciting, emotional, and intense parts in the story. It was a mix between a horror game, action, puzzle, adventure, and there was even a little love in there (Gordon and Alyx). It fit almost every category (heck, even DRIVING was in there!) and each aspect was pulled off perfectly. For those of you that don\u0027t think the ending was good, then you don\u0027t know what a good ending is. Half-Life 2 - an FPS - won\u0027t end with Gordon and Alyx dancing in flowers picking strawberries and singing \"It\u0027s A Small World After All.\" The game ended suspensefully so that you\u0027d buy Half-Life 3 (or in this case - Episode 1). If there were too many questions unanswered, then maybe the sequel to this game will answer them. Ever think of that? Overall, Half-Life 2 was an incredible game, and was beautifully presented with lush graphics and gripping gameplay. This is a game that everyone with a PC and a right mind should own and enjoy.… ",

And five Farcry puts everything in front of you because the user is scripted to do that (if you know what I mean), I know, I have that game, its fun only because I made it fun for me (Logically, something is fun if you allow it to or fun know matter what, then you know its awesome). Last but not least Doom 3 is cool and really fun to kill demons with a simple shotgun, I went through it on veteran and nightmare mode cuz its hilarious how its only a shotgun but get serious guys, you are asking for another game toooo... be like another game. Single them out and listen to yourselves. They both have great ancestors, especially Doom but in the end, they both share a common trait: Evolution and Revolution to a gaming experience that in the end challenged gamers and was fun (if they let it). Last but not least, for the people disapointed with the end of the game, two short things: 1you beat the main bad guy and that should be it, but it ends right there leaving off for another time after anymore Half-life 2 episodes all the way to another generation plus technology advances make it seem not that far off. 2its supposed to end if you gave a sh-- or not if you like it or not. Those of you who like putting down the game for reasons of they try or rip off just should realize the fact that all game companies do that but you aren\u0027t looking at the fact that products are made because fans have requested them or just want to show pride and the trademark makes money because money and passion go hand in hand. If what I am ending this is just to logical or too much for an explanation, then realize that some people are just saying stupid complaints and so this is their stupid answer(s) and a put down to them for being idiots and in every way a stupid moron for opening their slow unreasonable unthinking mind that should try to find a school that teaches advanced ways to look at morals and common sense before they embarass themselves on the internet. If you think I am doing that right now you either are one of them or are reading a message for someone else of a really low level of society (mind-wise because they don\u0027t know how to use it). In the end I will return to the real reason for this post before I dig to much into a hole that is actually a loop in human nature: point-reason-granted reason-back to first one. I will just say that his game is so awesome and I am glad I got this game which behind its awesome graphics and simple creation that some people don\u0027t realize was actually easy to make but the problem was that Valve couold have made a complex game with better whatever or stoop to easy-to-use technology and create an equally awesome game that still would have gotten the rate of 10\u0027s and 0\u0027s no matter what audience it came too. I am glad to be a Half-life fan and I am glad I spent 3 hours setting it up and go back and play it and test the physics to its limits no matter what cost game crash or pointless venture. This game gets a better rating than Halo (95) to both Half-lifes (96) (except for episode 2 because people saw that it should be that way and plus (a litle offtopic) the fans/fanatics ruined it almost like counter-strike. This game deserves a better audience just like some other games do but who can help something so natural anyway.… ",

As for the game: I\u0027ve played it on both an old (6 years now) and new (1 month) old PC. Both worked fine if you know how to tweak your visual settings. My gripe with this: At first Steam started automatically updating everything, which is where the \"gotta have the awesome PC to run it\" thing came in. Too many features being added without consent. So really, Game \u003d 15, but Steam\u0027s updates, support, and bugs bring it down.… ",

In my opinion Steam is the worst thing to hapen to gaming since E.T. for the atari. Im a Marine who is on deployment right now. I dont make alot of money so it was a choice between picking up F.E.A.R. or Halflife 2. I had played HL 1 and loved it, and only a demo of F.E.A.R. I chose HL 2 and have had a game that i could not play for 4 months because i dont have access to internet on a navy ship. What Valve didnt realize, or just didnt give a .... about what that not everyone has internet. Yes \u0027most\u0027 gammers do, but not \u0027all\u0027. Also \u0027most\u0027 gamers that i have talked too or seen on forums are angry or scared about what this means for the future of computer gaming. If someone dosnt have internet access he cant play games on his computer? That right there is reason enough for this game to get a 0. Its not like it helps fight piracy, in my eyes it makes it worse. There are cracks for this game everywhere, it took less time to find a crack then to register the game with Steam. Someone like me who has no problem paying for a game and registering it Is forced to go get a crack because he cant get his laptop to an internet source for the hours it takes to do the initial update, but its easy to take a flash drive and get a 30 second download of the crack. Valve has alienated so many gamers with Steam, and agin in my opinion has given pirates a major victory, by forcing someone who would normaly never download a crack to get one just to play the game he bought. Basicly, I will never buy another Valve game after this. They have lost me as a customer and i will recomend to all my friends who come to me for game advise to stay away from this company and any games they make. I shoulda got F.E.A.R.… ",

This game is for die-hard fans of the HL series and FPS games, and works best with an NVIDIA graphics card in my experiance and also ppl complaining about how \"STEAM ruined the game it took too long i couldnt update it\" stop your damn whining, I mean i got this when it came out and only until a month ago could i play it and i still rate this a ten, my point here being dont let a gay ass program ruin your fun. And for those who say it gets boring try playing in sparring. And also for the marine complaining about your internet issues, its called OFFLINE MODE use it retard it got updated. Now on to the ending complaints. You see they ended the game like that so that they could have an open horison on sequel pick ups, and the episode formate is to keep players from waiting another ten years for HL3 to come out. I for one acually love the way the game is set up. Ok and now to you story line nerds. This game did have a story line for those who payed attention, and it all pointed to the final solution of having Gordon Freeman lead a revolt against the combine of city 17. And in my opinion \" tedious. boring\" isnt a f***ing post thats an unintelligent lazy kid putting up an excuse to be different. Finally i would like to mention that people dont all put a ten to be with the in crowd as Hideto M put in his post, I call bullshit on his post with the \" It\u0027s human nature to simply mindlessly follow the crowd\" staement. Just beacause you dont agree with the rest of us who have taste doesnt mean you can call it human nature. Its social nature to want to fit in with a large crowd, and guess what. This is just a large FACELESS groupe of gamers we dont know each other and we dont need to worry about any reprocusions of our posting cuz there are none. well that was my post and i hope you ppl can now see some reason to their problems. If there are any problems i can be found in mostly any G-mod servers under the screen-name \"ShadowMarshal9525\" so you can take it up with me as a gamer instead of a poster.… ",

The game didn\u0027t scare me, it was its music. But enough about that. I grew up in FPS games and I have loved just about any of them which I played. Even those with the crappy graphics from 1993. When I first set eyes on Half-Life 2. I told myself: \"My my, what a pretty little thing you are!\" I saved it from its dusty EB Games shelf and bought it for my own. It proved cold to me, as Steam itself told me I couldn\u0027t do anything with this game until I had properly let it encrypt the game\u0027s data to ensure it wasn\u0027t a copied version. I could not refuse as I am a legit gamer. After an afternoon (just about) of attempting to install the game, I was satisfied to see its update finished. Over with that and up into the game I went. I was glad to see G-Man talk to me in such a kind way as when I left him in Half-Life 1. Then he sent me on to be chased by a ravenous Combine before I met Alyx (whom was indicated to me by Barney). Only then could I properly start defending myself. And only then did the game really start. The first few minutes of the game are all nothing but showing you how the physics work and that you can interact with characters around you. That, however, is a lie. You may think that: \"Oh, I can toss items on people or make a barricade if ennemies attack me.\" Que nenni, my friend. The ENTIRE game is based on pure action, where gunfight follows stabs from the crowbar on alien heads or zombie headcrabs. My all-time fear factor, the Barnacle, made its return. How pretty is that thing now, compared to the Half-Life 1 model. It looks like it was meant to be: A plant. Half-Life 1\u0027s model looked much more like a stalagmite hanging from a mountain\u0027s roof. Monsters, all-timer classics are back with some cousins. Headcrabs come with three species now... The old ones, the fast headcrabs and the black poison headcrabs. The old headcrabs are fat and dumb. The fast headcrabs are ... well, fast. However they wish, they can harrass you with absolutely no let down until you\u0027ve bashed them away with the crowbar. Black Headcrabs were balanced from their horribly startling attack. They make this sort of gremlin-ish warcry before dashing towards you with their gaping mouth. Contact, wherever they hit you, will drop your life to 1 HP. As it is a poison, your HEV suit will heal you gradually to your healthstate before the attack. That implies that if you\u0027re getting shot at that a headcrab hits you, you will instantly die. That is just about the only thing I loved, about the ennemies. The rest is for you to find out, if you haven\u0027t played. The A.I is silly. What happened to the marines in HL1 ? They were fast and effective, aside from those over-confident Combine warriors that stay in place, hoping their Kevlars will help them resist a shot from your .350 magnum. The world itself is vast and wealthy in graphical details. You\u0027ll come from a victorian neighbourhood, to a port, to a beach, to an old and dusty Jailing system and to the Citadel. The game itself makes absolutely no innovations as \"physical engineering\" has been seen in previous games. Some quirks look as though they might have been stolen from Quake 2, but are tossed aside as you just take a look at it all. The game in itself -can- be hard, if you are the kind to blindly run in and blast whoever\u0027s around you. But it can also be very fun, if you use your surroundings adequately. Certainly not the best game of all times, but certainly one of the best around so far.… ",

Also it is undeniably one of the most beautiful games ever; from the skylines to the textures on the walls to the wrinkles in people\u0027s faces.

Some reviews also complain about bugs, and I have encountered absolutely no bugs that were so bad they ruined the experience, and again, my computer is still nothing special. The multilpayer is awesome with HL2: DM and Counter-Strike and the few mods that are out (and the endless list of mods yet to come). The story is actually quite good (if you can figure out the things that were left out) and the ending, although many might disagree, I think is good. Or at least decent. It ended pretty abrubtly which was disapointing but was made up for from a mysterious speech by the G-Man. The ending, for sure, also falls under the catagory of suspenseful. The somewhat dissapoiting ending is made up for in Half-life 2: Episode 1 though, which you must buy after beating this game. In the end this game is great for any FPS fan and the sequals will probably just get better.… ",

If you\u0027ve not seen it yet, you\u0027ll understand why \"we don\u0027t go to Ravenholm\". HL2 is no longer new, but I think the graphics are aging quite well. It\u0027s supposed to look gritty and realistic, so expecting \"bloom\" lighting is a little silly despite it\u0027s appearance in almost every game since Guild Wars. Since no game is perfect and there are a couple of things about HL2 that I\u0027d like to see improved (AI has already been mentioned, and I\u0027d like to have seen more choice in the vehicle levels - take the boat and go the fun way or go by an alternate land route, for example) and expanded on, I\u0027m giving HL2 a 9. Probably 9.5 if I had the option :) Well worth the cost!… ",

Nice graphics, good texture work and good use of physics...at the start. I\u0027m not sure what everyone loves so much about HL2, and I am left angry and frustrated by the fact it repeatedly gets good scores. The game itself is intensely linear, the playtime is about average for a fps these days, which in my opinion is too short, especially if you\u0027re going for the \"holding your hand\" gameplay, as valve have done. At the start of the game there are some physics puzzles, but they seem to drop the idea after about an hours play. The enemy AI is practically non-existant, that includes the NPC\u0027s who \"help\" you later on. Nothing like any of the video\u0027s valve released of combat in late 2003. The weapons in the game also frustrated me. They do little or no damage to the enemies, and any powerful, or accurate weapon is restricted by the fact you can only hold 12 rounds for each (crossbow, magnum). The grenades in the game have a little red light on, and click very loudly making it painfully obvious when one is near you. I do wonder how the combine managed to take over earth using such poor weaponry. Most of the weapons left me with the feeling the player is to always be drawn into always having to engage the enemies at close range. Probably because if you encountered them at range, they\u0027d just run at you and you\u0027d kill them easily. There\u0027s a part later on in the game where you have to go down an alley towards a road at the end of the street, naturally there\u0027s a sniper watching the street. But, if you thought \"Ah, its ok, I\u0027ll get out my trusty scoped crossbow and take him down\" you would be suprised to find the ONLY way you can defeat this enemy is by manouvering your way up the street, and throwing a grenade into of the window. Again, an example of the \"holding your hand\" gameplay, and dictating the style of combat. The story too is non-existant, valve decided to go for the overly vague mysterious story, probably because they couldn\u0027t be bothered to think of one. My main beef with the game however, is how completely different it is, from what it was supposed to be. A 20 minute video was released at the end of 2003, showing all aspects of the source engine, and gameplay in HL2. Enemy AI ducked to cover, found alternative routes, and did not just run at the player and fire their guns. Friendly AI used cover, moved up and outflanked the enemy. And the area known as Ravenholm was filled with traps and combine, not zombies (something which I believe was introduced into the game just to offer \"a scary bit\") The whole presentation gave the impression HL2 was going to be something special. Intelligent, variable gameplay. There\u0027s nothing new about HL2, it\u0027s not realism, and it\u0027s not intelligent, in fact to an experience fps player, it\u0027s an insult. The source engine is good (even if the game has far too frequent, and too lengthy save \u0026 load times), and has enormous potential. Offering nothing upon the original this game seems destined to greatness purely because it is the sequel to one of the best fps ever.… ",

Though it kept This game had breakthrough physics, and it was awesome watching the guys collapse or get tossed around like dolls. The gravity gun was a unique weapon and really drew away from mainstream guns put in games today. However, this game also failed in a lot of aspects. While the potential and hype was driven up after years of suspense and waiting, the game just did not deliver. Though it kept my attention long enough to finish the game, I just was not impressed by it. The levels were pretty cool, though the city did get a little old after a while. The haunted city was probably the best atmosphere created in the game. But here\u0027s the biggest kicker: The weapons SUCKED. Yes, though the grav gun was unique, I ended up not using it for much of the game, because there aren\u0027t always objects to pick up and launch at people. Instead, you are stuck with a bunch of the same boring weapons as the first game - WITHOUT the aliens weapons. The only new gun I can remember besides the grav gun is the other combat rifle that also has a powerful (but generally unused) secondary fire. The random bullet pathing did not make it any better as you often waste a lot of bullets firing any of the smg/rifles from a distance any other than what you\u0027d call short (which is a lot of the game). The boring weapons combined with a so-so story line was not exhilirating in my book. Top it off with the same gameplay as the first game, and you\u0027ve got HL2 - which had the potential to be so much more.… ",

How many heros can you name with a super suit with shields?) The gameplay is ok, but I wasn\u0027t interested in being a lame knock-off of neo from the matrix in glasses, i wanted to shoot aliens. Instead, we get the stupid ai combine, who will run from a grenade and straight into your fire. The puzzles are also just them showing off their new physics and gravity gun. By the way, the gravity gun is stupid. There. I said it. Shotgun rules ( even though it was downgraded... actually, ALL the weapons were downgraded) because this game is not much differen than the original: run forward, solve puzzles, and you\u0027ll rarely fight in large arenas, just close quarters. The dialouge scenes are annoying and way to long. Other than that, good graphics and pretty gripping gameplay, save the lack of variation amongst the enemies. Wait! There is one more bad thing. Ravenholm\u003dnot scary and pointless. This level was just an excuse for the gravity gun, but a handy crowbar, shotgun, and .357 are actually the best weapons, at least for me. Hopefully they will be more creative in the future and stop trying to make another bad post-apocalpyse-revelution-thing that we\u0027ve all seen 1,000 times over. The game is very intense at points. Really intense. Ever try fighting a helicopter with a pistol in a radiated canal? Well, life gets a helluva lot worse for Mr. Freeman later on, but for us, it\u0027s pretty damn fun.

So I decided to stop playing knight Online and games with that graphic quality. With a bit of luck, i could buy a radeon 800x graphics card, and i started playing 1st person shooter games. This game lost a point from me because you needed to load all the areas of the game. Each time you finish an area (like the strider battle in ¨Follow Freeman¨ you needed to load the next area. The gamplay of this game has been also perfect, very smooth moving, (Not such as Halo that you felt ¨a little heavy¨) and the vehicle driving is also very good, very comfortable.

Unfortunately, I feel naive upon spending $60 for the Holiday Half-Life pack. I tried about 15mins. of the original Half-Life and couldn\u0027t stomach the graphics. Anyways, I tried Half-Life 2 and I thought the game was getting hung up during loading from escaping the civil police building. I had to do two reboots. I thought if I would re-download the game, maybe some corrupt files would be repaired or what not. Now, I haven\u0027t tried it again as of yet. The point of my low rating is this STEAM thing. Firstly, when I pay hard earned money... I do not want to install some \u0027third party\u0027 unknown program onto my computer(-5). Secondly, when I purchase a game... I want all files to be perverbially mine(-2). Thirdly, if I purchase a game... I want the right to have the installation on a separate machine(strickly gaming-no Internet) so I can play regardless of Internet connection or possible connection failure(-2). I am deeply upset about this set-up with STEAM, I had no idea prior and I don\u0027t like this what-so-ever(-1). I guess I\u0027m one of many that reviewed the game upset by the STEAM installation. I thought it over and came to the conclusion that it\u0027s my right as STEAM is part of the package that I never wanted. As with many game makers, Valve could have joined with GameSpy for online extras. Not all gamers are onliners. Many of us are satisfied and prefer single player games vs dealing with petty drama and idiots over the Internet. All in all, I will not purchase any game that is inbedded with STEAM. STEAM ruined my gaming experience with Half-Life, hence the poor rating. Nice work, Valve... but, the buck stops here.… ",

The graphics are amazing, better than F.E.A.R., better than PREY better than DOOM 3, better than Resistance, better than any thing I have ever seen.EVER. because the environments are beautiful, technology-wise and artistic-wise. Nothing feels over shiny, and they do not use any cheap texture tricks (DOOM 3). Everything is just as gritty or as polished as you would expect it to be. The gameplay is amazing..........absolutely amazing. It ranges from just curiosity of discovering phun with physics in City 17, to intense and gripping gameplay in Ravenholm, to running away franticly from a strider in the later levels, to OH MY GOD the gravity gun is now freaking awsome in the last chapter.The weapons are not necessarily diverse, most from the first game, but with the gravity gun, you don\u0027t really need many more diverse weapons.(although the little antlion food thing is cool too.) The enemys can be soldiers, helicopters, bugs, or even 3 story tall STRIDERS. And they all interact well with you and the environment. Few games make you feel for the characters like this one, especially with excellent voice acting. Last I would like to say that I just don\u0027t get how people could give this game a 1, i mean, we are all entitled to our opinion, but a 1, on a game like this, come on, do you have a grudge? are you a halo fan that doesn\u0027t want any game to steal its flare. i mean be fair, if you think that some movie knockoff deserves a 3 or a 4 how can you seriously say that Half-Life 2 deserves a 0? There, I put that out there I\u0027m done, I hope you at least found this review to be fair, because I tried my hardest not to go crazy and verbally punch you guys.… ",

Implemented as a tool in the war on piracy and as a means of efficient game distribution and praised by such magazines as PC Gamer, Steam is in reality a bloated, poorly conceived and overly intrusive internet portal whose required installation is used for updating and registering games. If you don\u0027t have a broadband connection you can literally spend 4 to 6 hours waiting for this ridiculous process to conclude. Even with broadband the hit or miss nature of the overly complex and unreliable installation procedure may require repeated downloading of large files and that can be particularly painful for those of us with limited bandwith usage restrictions. As a result I no longer buy games made by Valve or ones that use the Steam service for activation purposes. In my opinion this is just another example of corporate insensitivity to its customers and a cynical means by which to maximize its profits.… ",

I\u0027m not talking about long load times, stuttering, bugs, etc. Most of those have been updated out of existence by now and were probably due to my comp being strictly middle of the road anyway. No, I\u0027m talking about this sequels storyline being almost completely disjointed from the original, and the way the game keeps rubbing the physics engine in your face (BTW Max Payne 2 had Havok Physics as well and IMO utilized it better.) First off, I\u0027m a huge fan of HL1 and kept looking for some explanation of what happened to Xen, these Combine guys raise a whole new slew of questions and leave the old ones completly unanswered. We aren\u0027t even given much of a hint as to how all the supporting cast of HL1 made it to City 17 from Black Mesa. When I first played, it made my head spin. It\u0027s like they took the characters from the 1st and dropped them into a completely different storyline. And yes, the 1st time they gave me a physics based puzzle I thought \"wow, cool!\" when every other puzzle turned out to be a variation on this theme, I started to get a little peeved. That said, the story is still enjoyable, the graphics very impressive, the combats fun, and for those of you worried about the A.I. it does get better when you turn up the difficulty. Still a little annoying that they don\u0027t start off on the level of the marines from HL1 though. It\u0027s definitely worth your time and money, just...well...do yourself a favor and pick up the 1st one too. It\u0027s still what I spend most of my time on.… ",

Basically it all works now so download it or buy it on dvd. The best thing by far is the mods. Hundreds of free mods have allowed me to extend the already massively long playing time so that im still plying today. Garry\u0027s Mod 10 is particually good. As well as buying hl2, you should also buy Episode 1 and the others Episodes when they come out. Counter Strike:Source and Day of Defeat:Source are also amazing; you can buy them all very cheaply in the source premier pack deal.… ",

And just when I thought I was finally done, had finished it for good, it called me back once again to give it another play. And to my joy, there are now many more mods out than there were last year, and I\u0027m having a ball testing them out. My current favorite is SMOD Tactical: Delta 4. If you\u0027re like me and have bashed the shit out of the combine in every way possible, give Tactical a try, it\u0027s a definite wake-up call for all gamers. You think Half-Life 2 was hard on Hard? Please, try beating SMOD Tactical: Delta 4 on Easy, you\u0027ll be sorely mistaken if you think it\u0027ll be a walk in the park. Back to regular ol\u0027 HL2, though, I don\u0027t think there will ever be a game to best it. I\u0027ve never played anything better. The graphics are stunning, and it\u0027s an absolute joy to play it maxed out. You become immersed in the story, dug into the battles, and enthralled with the characters. The sounds are resounding, I still get chills up and down my spine when I hear the howl of a leaper echo through the level. I dare you, no, I challenge you to find a game that can suck you in as much as this one can. I haven\u0027t found one, not even Halo, or Halo 2 can even come close to this. I love this game, I love the characters, and I love the story. My heart races, eagerly awaiting the release of Episode 2, so that I may see the next chapter in the story of Half-Life.… ",

Its worth buying the game and putting up with steam jsut to have access to the various mods that have been produced. On my try of the game (after a day installing, no joke, non broadband and various problems calling for reinstillation) i was amazed by the opening sequence in the train and shortly after the station and city 17. I didnt want that bit to send, the city so lifelike, the cps bullying you, being able to peep into houses to see peoples gettin beaten up, people talking quietly about their supressors and various scanners looming the town. I carried on playing enjoying the long sojurn of the airboat, being different from the footsloggin before then. Ravenholm was impressive, the atmosphere created was nice, although over use of traps and the ability to get well and truly lost along with at one point a perminant spawning of zomibes. It was at this point where my family lost the internet... no internet, no steam, no halflife 2. So for a long time i went back to games like deus ex (deus ex being my favourite all time game). when my family got broadband i started playing hl2 again, finally realising how to get passed the respawning zombies n out of ravenholm. The mines wernt very impressive, they could have done better and the spinning blade cart at the end is... unusual to be round in a mine. The buggy part was fun being able to stop at place but antlion sandtraps wernt impressive, my pc isnt powerful, i get low fps and its hard for me to control various props, as such i noclipped passed the sandtraps. Nova prospekt fun until the point where over 50 troops attack you... the city 17 fighting was nice, i would have like dit if the citizens helped a lil more tho. The citadel at the end is stupidly easy, it seems more like a kiddys play gorund than a gran finale for such a game, being able to kill entire squads of combine elites in 1 shot isnt fun. Over all throughout the game some areas are lacking finishing touches, making them look bland and pointless (most of the blk mesa place) also throught the game you are constanly forced to comprehend wiht pointsless annoying and trivial physics puzzles, wat makes this worse is that most of them involve cinder blocks which have a habit of either a) sliding nicly off or b) knocking all the other cinder blocks then sliding off. so on my replays i often noclip past the various jumping and physics puzzles. The ai is somewhat dissapointing, from the reviews and teasers i was expecting npcs ot take cover, neil, grenade, supply covering fire and find alternate routes. For some scripted squences this does happen but youll often find in the way of self preservation and npc will stand still for a few seconds then either die of shift slightly sideways out of view, only to come bk into view to die, i mean shoot you. The city at the end was particularly nice, with the striders causing lot sof damage, it can be annoyign when you get lost in the rubble or cant find ammo crates to dispell the multiple striders on your tail. Some points are confusing wiht little differnce between them giving the impression of goign round in circles when really your on the opposite side of the building and while being fun the characters are far and few. I woudl have prefered to see more variation in the npcs behavior, more subplots woven in (like maybe jsut discovering a couple trying to escape), less physics puzzles, less steam and situatiosn where the character cna have an impact on the world instead of the same things happening everytime you play. Conclusion, amazing on first try, quickly looses freshness but some of the mods created are uttly superb (notably garrys mod and insurgency) its also worth triyng out counterstrike source. A warning to any who are interested tho you need constant inernet access better pc than mine and alot of pacience to put up with the evil steam. thnx 4 reading… ",

A popular game being liked is now its main cause for being horrid, if you like a game and its popular - then you\u0027re wrong. But if no one cares about an averagely rated and you somehow think its godly - well then you got the best game ever. Go ahead and read all the people who voted 0, there is no different reason as to what I already listed. I\u0027m not including the unrealistic physics arguments because that is just an all around lie, and the AI? Heh, yeah I guess it is horrible that they throw grenades back at you? Last but not least, the people complaining about the story are just not trying hard enough. No - this isn\u0027t a pop out book where the story is all laid out for you, but is rather a puzzle where you have to actually look into it and find out stuff for yourself. The only reason I can think that it doesn\u0027t appeal to you is that you have no imagination at all.… ",

Back to the one bad thing though Steam platform, Its great in the respect that if you scratch the game cd you can still play the game via download through the steam server, however offline mode does not function all the time and you need a fast internet connection! All so suggest having a PC built for gaming, good graphics card, atleast a high ghz duo core and lots of ram, your just not going to be able to appreciate the detail that has gone into the HL2 engine, the physics or the gameplay with out these! Well done Value looking forward to Episode two coming out next month!!… ",

As I stopped and stared, all I heard was the click-click-click of the observer drone and the constant droning of propaganda from the speakers on the wall. I was hooked. Nothing gets me more than an environment that is gripping, believable, and immersive. Not like that cluttered, illogical crap you get from Bioshock and others. HL2 just got better from there. Above average weapon selection. The gravity gun was a pleasure to work with. Interesting enemies to fight. Good story. And all of it so beautifully, visually and sonically, presented. I love the sound of that one later assault rifle (with the bouncing ball as the secondary): it was so satisfying to use (too bad it ran out of ammo so quickly!). Presentation will make or break a game like that. Thank goodness Valve got it right. Cons? Too short. \u003d)… ",

This time, Valve weren\u0027t content with just doing all the things you\u0027d expect from a modern FPS, and doing them well - they reinvented them all. Each level of the game conveys a different style of playing; whether it be solo, pair or team based combat, full out battles or cunning stealth, HalfLife 2 delivers. The biggest shock to the system is how well the physics model works - far from being a gimmick as it could so easily have been, it immerses you completely with the game world, and becomes another tool to use in solving the puzzles and fighting the enemies. HalfLife2 is a masterpiece. If you haven\u0027t played it, you\u0027ve missed out massively.… ",

Although linear at times, the game has such a high variety of environments that it never ceased to bore me. The enemy AI, despite what some seem to say was extremely bad, I thought was pretty good. True, enemies were never really faced with complicated decisions of tactics and the like, but they did flank and use cover. And they didn\u0027t rush you blindly (unless they had a shotgun). I also liked the lack of ammo that kept you scrounging or finding new ways to make use of the gravity gun, which, by the way, is simply put the most ingenious weapon ever designed in a video-game. Lastly, the story was excellent. Without an engrossing story, even the best of games can get tedious. This was an almost cinematic story, dishing out plenty of plot twists, reslationships, character backgrounds, and was generally just a really well-implemented part of this game. Any interested should buy. Any uninterested should buy anyway.… ",

Even if it were, the Quake engine is a very powerful one (see games like Nexuiz). Number two, the AI is rather low scale, but nothing like the crappy AI seen in Doom or Counter-Strike: Condition Zero. The storyline is linear, yeah, but so are Portal\u0027s (clearly so), Halo\u0027s and Dark Messiah of Might and Magic\u0027s plotlines. And they are still amazing games. The Source engine is probablyone of the most complex physics engines I\u0027ve ever seen. Sim S.\u0027s turn: Mabye gat a new computer, because Half-Life 2 loaded in under a minute on mine. I have an nVidia GeForce 7300 GT that runs C-S:S, Portal and HL2 with no problem. And if you are going to use a computer for gaming, at least make sure it fits the requirements. Christopher S.: Steam is one of the greatest gaming platforms I ever saw (Microsoft\u0027s Games for Windows -- LIVE is an utter piece of crap) and since I really don\u0027t have the space for CD\u0027s, it\u0027s convenient that I can just download my games after my annual system reformat.Trust me, playing the game at minimum graphics settings is not fun. If you have a load time of upwards of 2 minutes it\u0027s time to get a new computer, or at least upgrade your old, crappy Windows 2000 and/or Windows ME boxes with 128 megs of RAM and a *gasp* Pentuim III. GNU Gamer: get WINE, Cedega or VMware Fusion. Steam is Windows-only. Windows is, so far, the best and most widely-used platform on Earth. Want to make money? Either you overprice it and market it towards the \"Alternitaves\" (Mac) or make it a reasonable price and market it towards everyone else (Windows). Lord C.: UPDATE. \u0027Nuff said. AI S: Mabye you should have looked at the small print :MUST HAVE INTERNET CONNECTION TO PLAY GAME. Also, Steam is very widely-known and produced by Valve. Not third-party at all. Stop whining like a pussy and just do it already. You can even load Steam up in Offline mode to play the Single Player version offline. Take a little time to actually look at the Steam software. Madeline V.: Cheating is absolutlely unpreventable. Period. Even the VAC can\u0027t help that. It\u0027s what the VAC is for. If a server admin reports the person, then they get banned from playing Steam games online (they can still play 1P, but no MP for them). Look up the server admin\u0027s contact information and let them know. Kevin T.: All I have to say is, Portal and Counter-Srike: Source have to be a couple of the best games I\u0027ve ever played. And they\u0027re both HL2 mods. Thomas G.: It\u0027s an FPS. It\u0027s hard to balance action witn puzzles (see the other end of the spectrum - Portal), so give Valve a break. Republican Skillz: HL2:E1 was incredible. Don\u0027t judge a game before it\u0027s even released, it makes you look like an idiot. Yves B.: Just... utter fail right there. That review didn\u0027t even have any actual, you know, review in it. Carmine R.: COD3 can\u0027t even begin to compare with this game. Ian F.: How old are you? For the target audience (16-year-old males) this game is incredible. If you think a game with killing is boring, then you need to see a psychologist. Sean War: Doom 3 didn\u0027t have the Source engine. The Steam engine takes up more hardware requirements, and you probably lowered your Video options. HL2 has far superior graphics to Doom 3 (like Quake had to Doom 1). Jim F.: New computer. Stop trying to install it on your crappy HP Pavillion (or whatever you have, obviously it\u0027s not working). Also, what is the point in even buying a game if you\u0027re only going to play it for three days, then mabye once every few monhs for a hour? Just wrong. Why, oh why does everyone compare this game to Far Cry?? All the CryENGINE has on Source is the damn plants! I mean, come on. The CryENGINE was made as a demo for the GeForce 3. It\u0027s old as hell.… ",

Awesome, even with a medium-high level graphics card. Although compared to current graphics technologies, it\u0027s a little rusty, but compared to 2004 graphics, it\u0027s amazing. Storyline: 8 -Great storyline, but I didn\u0027t really get sucked into it, but then again most FPS games have almost NO storyline at all. And if they do, it sucks. AI: 7 -I have to admit that this game\u0027s AI is kinda....stupid? But what would an FPS be if the AI is so smart that they do all the stuff for you? It\u0027s good enough, (at least they don\u0027t suicide) so stop whining. Gameplay: 10- I can\u0027t stress enough about the gameplay. It is absolutely amazing. Some parts are crazy, with bullets flying everywhere, complete chaos, but there are also many parts where its just you. Those parts are for you to calm down after a harrowing firefight. Many games don\u0027t have that, it\u0027s just fighting, fighting, and fighting. Too repetative. Of course, you\u0027ll need at least a mid-high level computer. If you don\u0027t, you can\u0027t fully appreciate the game. Trust me when I say this: Get a good graphics card. It will prepare you for when you get theHalf-Life 2 Episodes. Those have HDR technology (I think...) so if you want to play those, you\u0027ll need a good graphics card. Steam...Steam...Steam....everyone\u0027s complaining about it. To me it is one of the best ideas ever. Once you register your game, its yours forever. As always, there are hackers, but if you are smart with your account you should have no problems. Many times I lost a CD and the game is toast. But for this, all you do is register, and if you lose the CD, all you have to do is download it. It\u0027s very convenient. Great game. Great engine. Buy it. Or then again, buy the Orange Box.… ",

And in this game Gordon is running everywhere to get here and there. Physics: 9- The physics of the game is very realistic. The only problem is that corpses in the game may pose weirdly. Injuries aren\u0027t something in this game either. Game Triggers: 10- The triggers do make sense and must be followed. Weapon Logics: 9- The weapons in the game have realistic movements and fire. But when used by A.I they reload faster: e.g although all ammo used, A.I reloads shotgun with only one bullet. Npc Body Language: 9- The npc\u0027s have very well developed movements. But they maybe be twitchy at times of pause. Game Secrets: 10- They are many hidden secrets within the game. Such as the trainyard outside Ravenholm. If you use noclip mode and go through the crashed train at the end of the trainyard, you will see Gman walking towards the back of another train and disappear around the corner. You\u0027d do well to discover all game secrets. A.I: 7- The A.I are very cooperative and persistent, but they can be dumb sometimes. Flame Effects: 6- From front view the flame is very realistic. But if from a bird\u0027s eye, the fire is 2D. Even so..Half-Life 2 still is an entertaining game.… ",

This forced me to play Half-Life 2 again and I had a hell of a good time. The game play is not much to complain about, although the game is somewhat very linear, but that doesn\u0027t count too much. Enemy AI is somewhat iffy but it is at least challenging. Also the friendly AI is somewhat annoying for me (they can get in your way a little bit). The story was interesting in my opinion to keep me attached to my computer to play it. The graphics for that time were damn good-looking. The sound is impressive (especially in voice acting) and in some occasions it doesn\u0027t. And back on the topic of over-rated games. Over-rated games are those who get advertised to much and in the end they are nothing more than just normal FPS without nothing new to show, much like the Halo series, I suspect that the people that post their low scores can be Halo fanboys or people who think that this game doesn\u0027t suit their taste, which makes me to wonder why the hell did they picked it up in the first place. Buying a game without looking it first is a terrible idea... People are perfectly entitled to their opinions, I respect that, like the former people I mentioned (not fanboys). But the only reason I\u0027m posting this is because people say many times that this game is highly over-rated... People who are giving this game a low score can be a little annoying (not for me) but be fair, this game is an excellent piece of game design and manufacture. And no, it is not perfect. No game is. It IS, however, a milestone in the development of the genre whether you like it or not. You people (or Halo fanboys) don\u0027t like the game? Wonderful, good for you. You guys have your reasons, which are, as far as I can tell, that you don\u0027t care for the setting and production design. This doesn\u0027t make it a bad game, nor over-rated. That simply means you guys don\u0027t like it.… ",

I found myself going through and playing the game, all the while saying to myself, \"NOW I understand why this is supposed to be the best PC game ever!\" and every time I meant it more, and more. This game managed to tear me from my shell, pit me in a new environment, and take every ounce of my attention until the very second it was over.

For one, the first 2 chapters are all introduction chapters with no monsters, which I thought was a bit too much introduction. Most of the Ravenholm chapter seemed to be rather short on ammo, which often frustrated me, though this may have been intentional. The first half of Anticitezen One seemed to be rather empty in terms of bad guys and offered little challenge, which made me a bit bored until the escitement returned later on in that chapter. Finally, the ending is a bit weak, with not much of a truely climatic fight, and what seemed to be somewhat of an incomplete closing scene. However, the rest of the game is virtually perfect. I thought the car and boat chapters stood out even more - I had about as much fun in these chapters as I\u0027ve ever had in a game, period.

One of the best things about it is the level design. You almost never see the same thing twice, with mind bending puzzles, well placed objects, and times where you only have time to think about escaping. Just when your getting bored of something, it moves right on to another great part. The story is also very well done. Everything about Half-life 2 seems lovingly crafted, and altogether it feels like your in a movie. Its basically a game and a movie all in one. Valve managed to rekindle the orginal half-life while still adding something new. This will remain one of the greatest shooters ever for a long time. And for all of you who say its too easy, turn up the difficulty. Its harder to aim, enemies are smarter, and health packs are less powerful and frequent. This is one of the best games ever.… ",

The engine hasn\u0027t been as buggy as you stated since the beta, and if objects hit you at 50 km per hour, your gonna get damaged in some way. Its probably your old computer thats making the engine so bad, so for your deity\u0027s sake, (and if your an atheist I can see why your so critical) get a computer that can run windows xp (stay away from vista) in response to the later quote, also creepily close to the original review, go play halo. Oh wait is that to liniar for you too? How bout you go play Oblivion, an rpg with no liniar game play, oh wait no explosions... well how bout you go play DOOM 3, I\u0027m sure you will be happy with blowing zombies and demons to bits, and the campy acting as well. Anyways the reason I rate this a 9 is because its a great game overall but the reason I don\u0027t rate this a 10 is they could have made it slightly more challenging, and because they took out so much from the original game idea (like awesome weapons) that would have made the game so much better. If they had started out with this and not taken anything away I would have given it a 10, but because it was great but could have been so much better I rate it a 9.… ",

If you look at Half Life 2 I was seriously amped for Half Life 2 when it first came out, I thought Half Life 1 was one of the best games ever and I was really excited about the sequel.

If you look at Half Life 2 for what it is, its an excellent game. I did not however prefer it to Half Life 1. Firstly it was drastically different from HL1 (which is understandable due to the new circumstances) it just didn\u0027t hate that same note that HL1 did. It is still a great game and one of the best FPS experiences out there, not to be missed.… ",

This is not a game, Its a tech Demo for a very beautiful, very versatile engine but entertaining to play... Half life 2 is not, unless you enjoy repeating the same puzzle every 30 seconds and navigating some of the worst level design that I have seen in any game. What could be a very thrilling and engrossing game, is broken up by a repetitive string of physics puzzles with no purpose other than to show off the physics engine. Which would have its own charm, were the puzzles not repeated every 5 mins with an identically puzzle. This is demonstrated best in any level that contains a vehicle for the player to drive, where you will have to move an obstacle out of your way every 30 seconds with the \"Gravity gun.\" Top that off with 90% of the plot being as in depth as Mario\u0027s \"The Princess is in the next castle, navigate your way to the next location\" and you are left with a game that left me \"Blue\" for a decent story and some thrilling action. Half life 2 is a monumental technical achievement, and the mods that have come out for this game make it well worth the price of purchase, but I would rather pull out and eat my own intestines like spaghetti than call this a \"reviting good time.\"… ",

You can run and gun but its not recommended. Its always good to take cover but not all the time. I\u0027ve heard some talk about the A.I being so good but it really didn\u0027t seem like anything real special. The combat zones Half Life 2 is an FPS that is announced by many magazines as \u0027\u0027Greatest game ever made\u0027\u0027. Personally I think that is had well balanced gameplay. You can run and gun but its not recommended. Its always good to take cover but not all the time. I\u0027ve heard some talk about the A.I being so good but it really didn\u0027t seem like anything real special. The combat zones were kind of limited so enemies would come out and shoot and maybe grab some cover in the process. Normally you will kill them before you see them doing something truly eye catching. The A.I isn\u0027t bad its just not amazingly impressive. The graphics are great. Reflections on the floor move as you do and texters are high rez. Character modles may not be impressive at first but if you take the time to see the lip synchronization and facial expressions. Characters are great and well developed. One of the icons of Half-Life 2 is the gravity gun. This unique weapon lets you pick up any object man sized and under and fling it at enemies. A but what would this weapon be without wicked good physics? These physics are very good. every thing not bolted down can move with the proper amount of force applied to it. However the only thing bad that came out of these physics is the puzzles you will encounter throughout the game. There are just a little to many. I personally didn\u0027t like it because this lead to an annoying lack of combat and the ability to move on. I had no problem solving most of them and it is satisfying when you do but when you look back on it it seems like a waste of time. One every now and then is fine but they went a little overboard here. sometimes you\u0027ll end up stopping you vehicle every five minutes because of there. Speaking of the vehicles the sequences were pretty cool apart from what was mentioned in the previous sentence. Even though you will end up having to stop look around and find a path. this can be really annoying after a while especially when you are being chased by a chopper. The story was a bit disappointing at the end and was slow moving through out the game. But now for some good things. The game does a real good job of immersing you. You really feel like you want to help the people and have a pretty good idea of whats going on. The arsenal was a decent size and had some unique stuff in it. overall this game is worth picking up.… ",

Half-Life 2 is a must buy for anybody who calls themselves a gamer. If you think Halo is the best game ever, I feel sorry for you, because you are out of the loop of games and are only seeing what the media blows out of proportion. Half-Life may be unrealistic unrealistic in parts, but what the hell, it\u0027s a game. Even the new xbox 360 version has already set the graphical, gameplay, and story telling standard for all games, and it was just released last year. Half-Life will live on in the same way that movies like Rockey have. Gamers will forever cherish their copy of Half-Life, and the expansions that came with it. I highly recommend this to anybody and everybody, even those who have never played a game.… ",

You must be blind...people explode into gibs in HL1. In Hl2 you cant do that, yes there\u0027s people being hanged and the \"scare\" element is more severe but...its nothing you couldn\u0027t handle surely. And its zombies you split in half not \"people\" have you even played the game properly? You think this game is violent? Try watching SAW 4 or playing F.E.A.R. you ignorant little child then you\u0027ll see. 3) You rate a game based on its level of gore? Really shows your age...GTFO. 4)Eyes bulging from their head? Now I know your making things up. 5) Its people like you who should banned and removed from ratings and reviewing games. You said your self your 13...but you cant even handle the gore in HL2? Wow your the biggest pussy I\u0027ve ever seen as well...grow up ffs. Now for the review...whats is their to say short of masterpiece? Its the most engaging, most atmospheric, most well designed and most BRILLIANTLY voice acted FPS game there has EVER been. Stunning graphics and physics engine for its time, and still is after nearly 4 years! Cant believe it came out before games like Bioshock and UT3 and such. Its virtually IMPOSSIBLE to get bored of this game. There\u0027s ENDLESS easter eggs and secrets to find, messing about with the physics is just spectacular, (And with GMOD really came the extravigance! :D) setting traps with the physics, building defences and making little towers EPIC! Playing with the AI, the epic scripted sequences of the helicopter chases, on foot chas.es...and the suttle little \"scares\" which keep you on your toes...its not FEAR, but it does the job well :). The only place were you can knock it down is the Team Mate AI. There not the greatest in the world but there not the worst, a lot of the time they will just run out and get them selves killed, or just not move at all, or get stuck etc etc. They can\u0027t use a lot of weapos either, only grendages, smg\u0027s, pistols and rocket lauchers but, they provide a decent meatshield :). Best part of the game? Well for me it had to be beach and highway 17 etc...I LOVED how the game \"opened up\" here, and it seemed less linear after your exploits in Ravenholm. The ambience of the ocean waves splashing up, the crowing of the gulls, the suttle remains of car crashes and corpses laying about with there bodies smeared across the ground, or hanging from ropes on trees etc...ooh the atmosphere is unrivaled. Love everything in that sequence. As well as the bridge scene :D. Ideed...only HL1 really comes close. And with all the mods HL2 has its very hard to get bored. With EP1/2/3 out or on there way, the experience continues to grow :D. Well done Valve...keep \u0027em coming!… ",

I gave it a 4 because of the graphics, which even now are a little lame and out-dated. Let me tell you why this game is a overrated piece of crap. First of all everyone is pissing out things like \"wow the ai are so intelligent and realistic, and wow there is so much interactions with levels.\" Bullshit, even on hard I had to laugh at the pathetic ai as they stumbled around like retards. They don\u0027t try to flank you, they don\u0027t try to circle you they just stand there shooting at you with the occasional strafe, and you can take your time killing them as their aim is terrible. As for your team mates, the most pathetic bunch I\u0027ve ever seen. They do a good job at blocking you, always annoying you with stupid dialogue and always dieing as they are retarded. As for interaction with levels, I think anyone who says anything about it needs some toilet paper to wipe away the shit they are dribbling. You can pick up a box with a gravity gun, uh... so? If you want examples of interactivity with levels try stalker or maybe even crysis. As for level design, it\u0027s always the same, complete some stupid puzzle a newly born infant could solve, kill about 6000000 stalkers and shoot at some retarded ai and go through some stupid scenery and lame secrets. As for your weapon choices, the most generic array of weapony i\u0027ve ever seen, I was bored to tears having to use boring guns with lame animations. As for dying, it\u0027s practically impossible to die as every metre there is a health pack or a health thingy on the wall. Another thing on level design it\u0027s just cliche move into this area kill everything there whilst using your crate of unlimited ammo and to many health packs then move on to the next area and do the exact same thing, get any more lamer or boring?? This game is overall an over-rated game that is just using all the credit from half-life 1 to make it seem like a good game. Use your damned head man, it\u0027s just another cliche to sit and rot on the benches or to be bought by stupid and gullible people who happily ride hype train to idiot vile. This game is a waste of money I suggest sticking to half-life 1, the true guru of games.… ",

The gameplay is extraordinary, and I felt that I could just jump into it in a snap. I didn\u0027t have to look at controls or anything, and I was hauling ass! As a given, the physics is amazing, and to add to that, the Gravity Gun adds more excitement in randomness. I recommend this game to everyone, hardcore or newbie casual.

If you aren\u0027t completely used to the controls of PC First-Person Shooter controls, don\u0027t worry. This game manages to make a first level without any weapons fun! It lets you get accustom to the controls and experience the amazing physics engine this game has to offer. While I was playing through this game for the first I was simply stunned, just by the fact that you could actually pick up objects in the game. The only other time I was ever able to do this in a game was when I played a demo of Deus Ex 2 (for Xbox) at my local Play N\u0027 Trade. As for the level design, it just simply blows my mind. I actually felt as if I was Gordon Freeman (protgonist of Half-Life 2). The whole game felt like an interactive movie, mainly because of the fact that you never leave the view of the main character (this means that there were no cutscenes). Graphics: 8 The graphics in this game are nothing special, pretty much average. Although the rare polygonal shapes (such as valves or steering wheels) can tend to be an eyesore at times. There can also be annoying glitches, such as getting stuck on an object while playing. But the great thing about the graphics is that when people talk, it looks realistic, making the game even more enjoyable than before. Audio: 9 The audio in Half-Life 2 actually feels believable. I found myself looking over my shoulder from time to time when playing through Ravenholm, to make sure there were no zombies behind me. Also, when you are stuck in the middle of an ambush and are shooting blindly at you\u0027re enemies, how can you be sure that you\u0027ve killed one? Half-Life 2 fixed this problem. Whenever an enemie is killed a certain sound is made, such as a squeel or beeping sound, this way you know if the coast is clear. Replay Value:9 I have completed this game at least 20 times, and enjoyed it every single time. My two favorite missions had to be Ravenholm and Highway 17. Also, if you get bored with the singleplayer campaign, why not try the multiplayer component of Half-Life 2, Half-Life 2: Deathmatch. This delivers hours of solid multiplayer fun, with the gameplay and weaponry of the original game we know and love. Overall: 9 out of 10 Half-Life 2 is a great game, you should buy this game if you get the chance.… ",

Half Life 2\u0027s best parts are Route Kanal and We don\u0027t go to Ravenholme which is a brilliant reminder of overall better games with an almost surreal film noir feel (like Max Payne 2) crossed with the survival horror of Resident Evil and Silent Hill. To its credit, this game has more moments of bleak surrealness such as disengaging from a hovercraft, after a very lonely trek, only to find yourself in a camp of headcrabs. If the game had been marketed and regarded as a surreal masterpiece rather than as just one all about AI, physics or character expressions, records that it could only hope to keep for a short time (it never had the best character expressions- the Gamecube Resident Evil remake did by far) then I would have scored it a bit higher. Apart from the sections I have mentioned, the game\u0027s graphics never seemed impressive to me on the Xbox and seem relatively prehistoric now. The hyperbole about this game is ludicrous- I had much more fun and emotional investment in playing Metroid Prime, Resident Evil (the remake), and Uncharted- Drake\u0027s Fortune.… ",

You are placed in an Eastern European locale, not very common with games, filled with powerful imagery of propaganda, graffiti, and the feel of an Orwellian fascist state.

The friendly and enemy AI are both impressive but in combat, they sometimes have their moments. The music is great with its balance of atmospheric dark rhythms and upbeat techno songs.

Then I was browsing the internet and I found out you can hack steam (games for free). I only wanted to play hl2 with NOCLIP so I did the hack. I got the full version of HL2 and HL2 Deathmatch (also should be induced on the consoles). I played the game agin but not to beat it but to explore and spawned enemies/allies every where. Though I cant stand hammer editor (confusing) the doom 3 editor is my favorite map creator. The \"Hammer\" editor requires confusing set-up before you can even use it. Later I was looking for cheats and I saw some comands like \"give weapon_molotov\" and \"give weapon_hopwire\" WTF Then I tried it and it didn\u0027t work then I went back on the website and it sied :these are only codes for the beta version of the game\" WTF? so I search on how to get this \"beta\" version (takes me forever to find and it was apparently \"leaked\" so I download it. then I lean that you have to do console commands to start the beta game. Then I think WOW! LOOK,,,!,,, at all of this deleted content now I;m saying Half-life 2 retail SUX DONKEY DICK... BUT....half-life 2 beta SUX HOT GIRLS TITS.Now I play the beta (giving it a \"10\") I no longer play the retail (except for mods) If only I could do a review on the beta. Also for you peaple who don\u0027t like VALVe\u0027s steam the beta is not for steam (it\u0027s also not a hacked stand alone) it was originaly going to be a game with out steam. I plan to be a vidio game maker and I will sell/give away the beta version(s) of my game(s) because every one wants the beta, as long as I write something like \"warning this version of the game is the beta and may crash a lot) or something before you buy it.… ",

I really enjoyed the Nova Prospekt level too. Ravenholm was tolerable, but after a while, the fun of beating headcrabs with a crowbar kinda wears off. Four things missing from this game: 1) Displacement physics in the Source engine 2) A dual-wield weapon/item hold system- anyone else remember the chair-pistol wield from Return to Castle Wolfenstein? I liked that. Also, wielding 2 pistols in Route Kanal would be fun. 3) The sniper rifle. There is actually code for one there somewhere, honest, but its not a usable weapon as there are no models. 4) Flyable vehicles. Okay, so we have a boat level, a car level, a foot level... why not stick a chopper on the roof of that building by the citadel and fly through C17 strafing the striders? Finally, I have had no problems with Steam, in fact, I love it. It makes it so much easier to have a combined game browser (all my non-steam games have shortcuts there), and a chat feature which shows the game you are playing and if it is a multiplayer game, a join the server feature. Finally a reliable game organisation and multiplayer co-ordination system that works. And yes, I\u0027ve tried most of them. GameSpy is adequate. GameShadow is a waste of space.

I consider this the best FPS story-wise and just an all around amazing game. Who is the G-Man? Who does he work for? Why Gorden Freeman? In the Future, I hope to have these questioned answered!… ",

The zombies are just scarrier than ever and much more eneimes from HL1. Those who played Half life 1 must play this no matter what it is. At least renting it would just be darn good than a demo. It\u0027s a shame that the price is a little too high. But hey I still went to a internet/gaming cafe to try the heck out of it. And man was it worth every penny.

The game is great overall, it has polish through the roof! Even though VALVE today is known for amazingly polished games The gameplay is amazing! Shooting enemies is very satisfying, and since there are many enemies to shoot - you\u0027ll be neither frustrated by the combat nor will you be bored without it, since times without enemies are very rare. But when there are no enemies to fight, the game presents you with a variety of puzzles, mostly physics based. The physics of the Source Engine are one of the best out there, and considering this game is pretty old - it\u0027s kind of surprising. Although there are 2 complaints I have about the gameplay: 1) There aren\u0027t enough guns. Considering HL1 had so many of them, this one falls pretty short. The addition of the Gravity-Gun basically makes up for it. 2) The Teammate AI is pretty poor. The enemies handle great by taking cover, throwing grenades, working in teams to defeat you. Considering that, it\u0027s kind of surprising your teammates are so dumb. They rarely hit enemies, often get stuck somewhere and they do some other things, that you wouldn\u0027t want your teammates doing. The graphics are also a marvel to look at, even 5 years after its initial release. You play in huge, beautiful landscapes with great detail. Models are also beautiful, especially thanks to the incredible facial animation VALVE managed to put in their game. I have 0 complaints with the graphics. The sound is also great, featuring a pretty good soundtrack (although rarely heard), great sound effects (people who were making them probably had the hardest job ever, since the items you shoot from the gravity gun against other items make a sound varying depending on which items you shoot at which, so they had to make a hellish amount of combinations) and an amazing voice crew, with every single character talking in a very believable manner, which along with the realistic facial animation make for a pretty great atmosphere. The game is pretty long, lasting about 10 hours through your first playing, and for some reason - I keep wanting to replay it again and again over time. And I also forgot to mention the story. The story unfolds in a near flawless fashion. It\u0027s weird that Gordon never speaks (again), but it can be easily forgotten. You\u0027ll be hooked by the storytelling and drawn into the action naturally. A story that even beats HL1, in my opinion. I had very little to none complaints about this game, and I think it deserves a 10. The complaints I did have, however, are really minor and you\u0027ll barely even notice them while playing this amazing gaming experience. If you still haven\u0027t played the game - what the hell are you waiting for? BUY IT NOW! I suggest getting the Orange Box, since it comes with HL2 and both of the episodes, Portal - which is an amazing puzzle game that you\u0027ll find very unique and fun to play, and Team Fortress 2 - which is an amazing/cartoony Online MultiPlayer shooter, that\u0027ll have you hooked. Story - 10 (8 if you haven\u0027t played HL1) Gameplay - 9 Sound - 9 Graphics - 10 Lasting appeal - 10 Overall (average score) - 9.6 ~ 10.… ",

The environments such as city 17 (boring), ravenholm (disgusting village), highway 17 (ugly ass beach), and nova prospekt (nothing but corridors) are just depressing and horrible. The main character is...well, there is no main character, just a floating crowbar, gun, gravity gun named gordan. The Overrated garbage, the most boring and depressing game i\u0027ve played in my entire life.

The ONLY good thing valve ever did was make left 4 dead 1 \u0026 2, every other game they made sucked major balls, ecept portal which is average at most). Critics only gave this game good scores because of the gravity gun and the storyline, which is slightly above average. Besides, normal and casual gamers don\u0027t play games like these: a game for computer nerds or pc geeks: the only ppl who obsess, or even like this game, or think it\u0027s the best, which is NOT. This game is below average, average at the most. It would be an ok game if the environments didn\u0027t blow ass. The character development was pretty good though (especially Eli and Dr. Mossman, which were the most likeable characters). The only good part about this game is near the end, in the Citadel. Overall, this game is below average, avoid it and play epic games like San Andreas, Max Payne series, Kingdom Hearts 1 \u0026 2, Metal Gear Solid series, Halo 3, Modern Warfare series. Just not this, unless ur an obsessive nerd. That\u0027s why there were a lot of copes sold, because there are so many nerds that want an alien hunting game with science themes.… ",

The game is very realistic. I was thrown headfirst into this world and I must say that I was completely immersed in it. The graphics are extremely good and the level design is still amazing. The water effects blew me away! The characters have very good lip syncing and extremely life like emotions with great voice acting. Every location, from the urban City 17, to the extremely creepy Ravenholm are designed very well. I think that many might say that Valve spent a long time on it and will complain but I will just say how I think all that time making it shows. If I could make it so, i would give this an 11.… ",

The game was the kick-off for the Source Engine, that would be used for many other great games. The game provides a new storyline for the Half-Life-series and a total new environment. For the first time wondering around in the outside world (Eastern-Europe?) experiencing the consequences of the events that happened in the Black Mesa laboratories. The first game ended with the mysterious Gman and this game starts with him, dropping Gordon Freeman off in City 17. Directly meeting the Combine confronts you with the earlier mentioned consequences. The Combine conquered the world after the aliens landed first via the events of the first game. As a survivor of the \"Black Mesa-incident\" your trying to find out whats going on and what needs to be done. Overall the game has different great atmospheres. The developers used the look of Eastern European buildings from the Cold War as a decor in urban maps, but also has many other rural scenes. (9.0)… ",

The story is a masterpiece, showing you a world held hostage by the powerful Combine, an alien race who came to Earth after the events of the first game and all but enslaved us. Remember the physics of the first game? Half Life 2 has cranked those up to 11, with beautiful flames that will have you standing by fires and realistic crows that take off when you approach. And then there\u0027s the combat. Like the first game, it is executed perfectly, but I noticed that many of the guns are almost exactly the same. You get the standard pistol, the crowbar, the shotgun, the smg, the rpg, the grenades, and the crossbow. The only weapons that seemed new were the assault rifle and the gravity gun. Oh man, the gravity gun. I could write an entire review just about that, how you can pick up and push items, solve puzzles, etc. Throughout the game you\u0027ll visit a number of locales, from the Antlion-infested beaches to the city of Ravenholm, which is positively crawling with zombies.

Half life is a step above because of its individualism. it also has elements from some of those catagories. Its a shooter with warfare scifi elements.

The plot can be written this short: - Gordon joins resistance - Eli is captured - Mossman is a traitor - Alyx is captured too - Mossman is a traitor again, so prisoners are freed - they blow **** up So what kind of plot is that?? But anyway, it\u0027s nice to play in the parts where it\u0027s well made and not too repetitive. For example the lighthouse, turret defense and driving parts I liked. After all, a well made linear FPS is always better than a non-linear game gone wrong. For example Far Cry 2 tries to create a free world, but it fails miserably.… ",

People who say this game is overrated and bad simply have no idea of what makes a great video game. The game adds a minor scare factor that adds to the enjoyment and keeps you wanting to play more. The music is an absolute amazing addition to this game, with soundtracks coming into the game at the right moments (driving sections of the game). I thought I was going to spoil this game by playing a large amount of Garry\u0027s Mod before playing and making the main characters look silly, but boy was I wrong. If you think there is no story or it is a horrible story, once again you have no idea. The storyline is another excellent dystopian story which is made clear by the Rebels and Citizens trying to survive in this horrible world. And if that is not enough for you, the game is riddled with challenging puzzles to make the game experience even more enjoyable. This game is not a \"generic FPS\" simply because it is a masterpiece where only Bioshock comes close to being as good. I was first very skeptical about critics saying this was the greatest PC game ever made, but now i have played it I can see why critics have regarded this game so highly. You cannot afford to NOT play this game.… ",

I have yet to play a Valve game i didn\u0027t like. I remember drooling over gaming magazines when they were showing images from the upcoming HL2. and the videos they released that showcased the physics. That clip of the manhacks coming down the hallway, whirring along slicing up everything in their path. And their take on audio is awesome. The sirens, the voices of the combine through masks or communicators. the sound of those weird energy orb thingies. down to the solid way the very first handgun felt in \"your\" hand.

I think it doesn\u0027 t fit there where it is but they put the chapter in to show the physics. The bad things. Is Gordon Freeman a Superman that he can drive and open doors without hands? Sometimes it is boring to listen other characters because they talk too much. Little graphical failures and they are the bad things.

The graphics are ugly, seriously, until the later updates to the Source engine that weren\u0027t part of HL2, the engine put performance on low end machines ahead of looks, and the result was urgh. The game itself is only rated highly by reviewers for 2 reasons; 1) they are paid off by valve or valve fanboys and 2) the blue balls story of Alex. The entire plot revolves around a moderately attractive female and all the teenage kids cant stop drooling. There is no exploration, it is utterly linear, go here, do this, go there, do that. No freedom or choices to make. The weapons are awful, terrible. they are the same stupid weapons from HL1 they held on to purely for nostalgia and they suck. 10 years later and no personalisation, no new weapons of any note, no customisation, no free roam, no open maps, no interactivity with the exception of a gravity gun that lets you - wait for it - pick up a box. Holy Crap! Wow! A box! The AI of enemies blows and of squad members (which was a much praised addition) sucks so hard its hard to even put into words. Their only contribution is to get in the way and block you. The levels are generic, ugly and totally bland with no imagination or originality. The only thing they have is a few parts ripped from Hollywood films like The Matrix. the ending sucks, the characters are all vanilla and forgettable, the G-Man appears like a caricature of a bad guy. The game is short, aimed so they can throw out more DLC at a price, it is probably half the length of HL1. This game is at best a 6/10, but I\u0027m giving it 4 because of the obscene reviews posted that are just blatant lies.… ",

Some of the Aliens will now actually help you and humans make up for the biggest part of enemies you\u0027ll encounter throughout the game. The graphics were good and the physics aswell, but it still didn\u0027t manage to replace the feeling one got when you played through the first one of the series. There is a story but it\u0027s weak and not very special, I actually had to play through it twice to even see that there was one.

But with Half-Life 2, they slow down and take some time to think. And not only that, the action is amazing and fun. There is only one problem and that is that the AI is stupid and lacking at times, but it doesn\u0027t effect the game play that much, it just makes the enemies a little easier.

The differences and lack of continuation easily outnumber the similarities. First, there was the unexpected motion sickness. I was surprised to discover, upon Google searching, that many others also were put through the same discomforting extreme nausea. In short, the game is repetitive, surprisingly linear, lacking severely in storyline, and not much really happens. You just go from point to point, without not very much explanation. I should also mention that you should expect to spend between two and three hours driving around in vehicles; which I did not appreciate in any way. I like the Combine soldiers; they are cool, but besides them, there truly aren\u0027t many interesting enemies or a good variety of them. Another letdown is that you cannot inflict damage to friendly NPCs like in the original Half-Life. This really bothered me. Also, why are Vortigaunts suddenly my friends, without any explanation whatsoever? Squad members are close to useless and have no real point in being there except for acting as decoy and getting in the way of your path. Valve decided it was a good idea to include incredibly annoying and cheap techno music at times, which disrupts the dark mood and atmosphere. There are too many situations where you are forced to shoot at the same, ever repeating, large, uninteresting targets with an RPG. The boss fights (if you can even call them that) are not creative at all. They are uneventful, uninteresting, and anti-climatic. Overall, Half-Life 2 lacks a story, depth, and creativity. It took me about 21 hours to complete.… ",

The story unfolds very, very well and the pacing is of the highest quality you will find in a shooter even now in 2011. Voice work is top-notch and animations can be stellar even by todays standards.

The storytelling in Half-Life 2 is also special, despite being an action-FPS game. Like Bioshock, Half-Life 2 has a way of telling the story to the player while they are doing other things in the game in such a way that the player never really feels bored with being told a story, despite the fact that they accumulate knowledge of the world and all its intricacies throughout their gameplay experience. The physics and gameplay are also masterworks of FPS gaming. This is one of the first gaming worlds that ever felt \"real\" to me. The graphics are superb for their game, and honestly are acceptable by many even considering today\u0027s standards, assuming you aren\u0027t spoiled by the recent influx of advanced-graphics FPS games these days that have crappy storylines.

Despite its outdated graphics and being a 2004 game, the gameplay is way more superior than most FPS games today (i.e. Black Ops, Modern Warfare 2/3, Halo, etc.), and it has an excellent deep plot, which, for me, has political themes as it is about a revolution against foreign alien invaders called the Combine. In addition, the plot has much twists and suspense that will make you feel intrigued and curious on what\u0027s going to happen next in the game. In HL2, you play as a mute Resistance leader, Gordon Freeman, in a revolution against the Combine, which was indirectly caused by the Black Mesa Incident in HL1 and with the excellent first person feel, you are able to go in Gordon Freeman\u0027s \"shoes\" as he leads the resistance against the alien invaders. Plus, there are puzzles that make the game challenging, which are mostly used by the Gravity Gun, an awesome weapon intended for carrying objects used for puzzles, and using innocuous objects as weapons against Xen aliens and Combine Soliders. Another proof that HL2 is superior to today\u0027s FPS games is that there are various enemies and environments, thus making the game less repetitive and more addicting, especially in the Ravenholm level and the Citadel missions, where you can even throw Combines everywhere with your gravity gun, making you feel like a god. In overall, HL2 is full of thrills and adrenaline which no other FPS games can have. I hope Gabe Newell exits HL3 from vaporware so that I can know what will happen next after Eli was killed by Combine Advisors.… ",

Half-Life 2 is the most original game I have ever played, it deserves its rating. How MW3 got its high rating I\u0027ll never understand; it\u0027s basically the same game as MW2. People need to look away from just having the best graphics, they have to start looking at storytelling and innovation. This game has soul. People says I had my opinion BEFORE I started playing this game, guess what, I hadn\u0027t read any reviews, I had barely heard about it. Trust me, turn on subtitles and pay attention to the dialogue of this game, and you will fall in love with it.… ",

When HL2 first came out I wasn\u0027t so keen on it. Now that having played through it again, as well as both of the episodes, I really came to appreciate how decent the game is, even compared to the games coming out nowadays. HL2 is not just an FPS game. It might seem like so at first, but there is a whole new level of depth to the gaming experience when it comes to this game. HL2 puts the player in all sorts of varying environments and against all sorts of enemies, each time changing the situation, so that you\u0027re never bored. The game is very dynamic. It keeps you surprised, changing the challenge all the time. On top of that it is very rewarding, as games should be. If you spend some time to explore for example, you find good items. The weapons are very enjoyable to use in combat, and some are even pretty unique. The Gravity Gun for example is very diverse in its applications and can be easily used for most of the combat situations in the game. The rocket launcher gives a whole new meaning to the term \"homing\" as you navigate the missile at your enemies with a laser sight. Every weapon is fantastic, whether it\u0027s an awesome sniper crossbow, or bugbait used to attract antlion creatures to attack the enemy. The storyline continues from the first game, except takes place a few years after. Gordon Freeman (the playable character) now finds himself in a dystopic society, where alien civilisation by the name of Combine is ruling over the humans on Earth. The story of HL2 manages to show tyranny and oppression really well. The story still leaves some loose ends, which opened up an opportunity for the sequels. Half Life 2 is generally an all round great game with no outstanding flaws whatsoever (although I felt that earlier parts of the game weren\u0027t as good as the latter parts). Great story, fun gameplay, beautiful visuals, nice soundtrack, and very lifelike NPCs (they act just like real people!).… ",

Right from the start, the game had me hooked, and this is despite the fact that I had never played the original Half-Life before. Valve manages to deliver the perfect blend of story-telling, action, and puzzles in a way that keeps you immersed and interested from start to finish. Even when you\u0027re sitting through a bit of dialogue, you\u0027re intently listening to the trade of words, eager to learn about the state of your world and what must be done for the betterment of mankind. The voice acting is incredible, the shooting mechanics work well, and the story is phenomenally written. I find myself returning to City 17 regularly, despite the linear gameplay. The only reason I\u0027m hesitant to give this one a 10 is--well--it\u0027s not perfect. I mean, it\u0027s all there: the voice work, the story, the environments, the immersion. Every little bit of it is absolutely incredible, and yet, I refuse to give it a 10. Maybe it\u0027s because I\u0027m a little skeptical to the idea of a \"perfect game\", or maybe it\u0027s got a shortcoming that I\u0027ve overlooked... In order for it to be perfect it has to have it all, and that includes replay value. The unfortunate thing with such a story-driven game is that once you\u0027ve played it, you already know what happens, so there isn\u0027t much reason to pop the disk in again. Nonetheless though, this will always be one of my favorite games of all time, and if you haven\u0027t yet given it a try, I highly suggest that you do. You won\u0027t be disappointed.… ",

The sound design is beautiful from crashing buildings to the moans of striders in the distance. Voice acting is also top notch 10 out of 10. The level design is top notch in every area in the game i have a few problems with one part but that\u0027s just me. 10 out of 10. The game play is amazing its always surprising from level to level there are parts were you will be in a car running over giant alien bugs, then in a town alone with no ammo and full of zombies, then to a full out wars and great puzzles. This deserves a 10 out of 10. The final part of my review the brilliant story. Just like Half Life 1 its all toward from the players perspective Gordon Freeman with no cut scenes. Without spoiling to much its been twenty years after the first game and a alien race called the Combine have enslaved humanity on its on planet forcing people to work as slaves. That is all i will reveal the rest is up to you to find out. It gets a 10 out of 10. So this game gets a 10 out of 10.… ",

This game has something for everyone. The game itself is pretty good. For being released so long ago, the physics and graphics aren\u0027t as bad as you would think. Actually, they\u0027re pretty nice. In my whole time playing I\u0027ve never seen a texture glitch, or an error in the physics. It can run pretty good with an out of date computer too. You don\u0027t need to steal a computer from NASA to play this game well. In fact, that dinosaur of a computer you keep in your back room or basement could probably run this fine. When you\u0027re playing the game, you know A LOT of time went into designing and planning this game. It seems that whoever made the game knew which turn you would make before you made it, and planned for it accordingly. The design of the levels are so complex and interesting that I don\u0027t know how any human being could create something so amazing. You may walk through a door and find that the hallway ahead is blocked, so you take around five or ten minutes navigating through air vents and dark rooms, only to find yourself popping out right on the other side of the blocked hallway. Ten minutes to move ten feet. The characters in the game also add to the amazing feel that the game gives you. The characters really find a way to connect to you in this game. It gets to the point where you actually feel like you\u0027re Gordon Freeman. It makes you want to laugh and cry with the other characters. The emotions that the game conveys are amazing. To sum it all up, this game is amazing. Absolutely amazing. I could not recommend this game anymore. This game is easily my favorite game of all time. If you have a little money to spare, this is the absolute perfect thing to invest your money in. Every second you play it will be worth it.… ",

If you were to watch a playthrough of Half Life 2 without having any control over the character at all, It really wouldn\u0027t effect the overall experience that much.

In 1997 Valve made its debut with its legendary title Half Life. The Game sparked a new era of gaming, and redefined the First Person Shooter by going well and beyond just shooting. Any one who played Half life, and immersed themselves in the experience would understand this. Then in 2004, Half Life 2 is released to the public, throwing the player into a post-apocalyptic earth. Let me make my opinion up front. Half Life 2 is positively the best First Person Shooter that I have ever experienced in my life. With its ground breaking graphics, which still compete with games of today. Its advanced AI systems. Its superb voice actors. Its intense gameplay. All \"COMBINE\" with each other to form an amazing experience. There is only one issue with the company Valve, and that is that they take forever to make a video game. However, the end result seems to justify their means of achieving it. All UPHOLD THE UNIVERSAL UNION!… ",

This is simply better than CoD, Halo or any series for that matter, genre - RPG, FPS, RTS, MMORPG, etc... the list goes on. Simply put, an engaging story, amazing physics and challeging and innovative gameplay and puzzles as well as deep character development and excellent level design. Get this and any title made by Valve, The Orange Box e.g. has this game and a few others and is easily the best gaming bundle deal of the century because of one reason - it has this game and the fact that you won\u0027t find a better game than this, I can assure you and anyone who reviews this with a 0 or something like that because of Steam. Steam has greatly changed and improved over the years has no idea of what they\u0027re talking about and should go and play CoD and then start talking as it\u0027ll change their mind and they will see, just how perfect this game is, just how much it has achieved - awards, game design, technology improvements and innovation as well as being a pure, landmark title that noticeably and simultaneously remarkably stands out from today\u0027s games where campaign\u0027s last only about 6 hours or less (compared to Half Life 2\u0027s length of approximately 25 hours or more) and do not care about their fans or the fact that the game is complete garbage and continue not to fix or upgrade it. Having said all this... there\u0027s still not enough to be said or praised about this title, what it represents, how much it has made known gaming as an activity/hobby, achieved - i.e. (that is) famous, just how good it is and how it deserves to be played by anyone who is interested in anything or any certain type of game as this game is simply put, as the best game that has ever come out and existed and will contine to be so for centuries to come, having its name yelled out and its legacy and origin living on (no pun intended). My PC friends, you will find no better game than this and me constructing long sentences for this game review is completely justified when you understand how good this game is and when you have played it - being immersed and absolutely bewildered at just how good this game is - if I haven\u0027t said it enough ALREADY - THIS game is good, more than good, in fact if I could rate it 20/10 I would do so but that would lead to an improper fraction and also metacritic doesn\u0027t let me :( Overall, that is all. BUY NOW as YOU WON\u0027T REGRET IT, if I haven\u0027t convinced you enough - look at the all other positive reviews and take these facts for one: highest metacritic scoring game - EVER, most awards and impressive achievement shown and won by a game, biggest PC community - mods and support and made from ValvE - the people who implemented Steam - a download client program for PC (like XBox Live for Windows) and made many Source game-engine based games that were successful and have been continuing to make blockbuster sequels since then including continuing and expanding this \u0027Half-Life\u0027 game into a series and they are known for much, much more other stuff and being the most awesome people on the planet that make games for gamers by gamers as they say, a great development team and/or publisher of their own games and/or work, need I say more about this game or ValvE... ?!… ",

Yes - it\u0027s a linear shooter, and there is nothing wrong with that if you understand how to do a linear shooter. We don\u0027t need constant screen hints telling us we have \"Jump here\" or \"Crouch behind this rock\". We don\u0027t need radars or flashing arrows on the screen telling us where to go. FPS games these days are aimed towards people who can\u0027t think and need to be told how to do everything. In HL2, yes we follow a linear path, but we also left to think for ourselves, solve little puzzles and even sometimes take on a kind of platforming style unlike COD (and many others) games where we just watch the fancy explosions and get told where to go and what to do (and I just had to laugh at his comment in another review - \"The story\u0027s nothing special either. Although it\u0027s linear, there\u0027s no objectives so it\u0027s possible to get lost on where to go/what to do\" - My point exacaly, because you have to think for yourself !). HL2 gets the cinematic approach spot on, makes us feel like we are part of the story where other FPS games makes us feel like we are just sat there watching a shallow action film. Every enemy in the game has to be approached differently, unlike most other shooters where you just aim and hold down the trigger and again watch the fancy explosions and gibs flying everywhere. And to moan about the graphics ??? Seriously ? Why is it that\u0027s all people care about these days. To me this game still looks great even today (8 years later is it ? I can\u0027t remember the release date atm), and if you don\u0027t like it check out the great MOD community (Cinematic mod). So if you like to think for yourself and actually take part in something called game play, this game is for you. If you like a dumb shooter where you constantly told what to do and are impressed more with graphics and explosions, stick to your COD games.… ",

The game was able to accomplish a very cinematic feel and tell a great, detailed story without the use of cut-scenes. The facial expressions of the characters in Half-Life 2 were something that blew away many gamers. Facial expressions in video games have never been done with such detail, the only game that has beat Half-Life 2\u0027s facial expressions is L.A. Noire. L.A. Noire didn\u0027t come out until 2011, seven years after the release of Half-Life 2. That tells you just how technically advanced HL2 was. Facial expressions were not the only aspect of HL2 that seemed to catch player\u0027s attention. The physics engine is what had many players and critics alike in a frenzy. While real-time physics had been in video games before, Half-Life 2 took it to a whole new level. It made players actually use physics in order to solve puzzles and defeat certain enemies, instead of using the engine as something cool to look at, e.g., Halo series. The level of immersion that followed was overwhelmingly satisfying. Players were given the freedom to interact with many objects and do many things that they normally could not do in other games. Half-Life 2 gave players the illusion of freedom; many puzzles were designed so that there was no specific way to accomplish them. Not only that, but many areas had secret alcoves and otherwise unreachable areas that could only be reached if the player utilized the physics engine, giving players a sense of an open-environment. Half-Life 2 is able to create a very non-linear experience within an extremely linear game. I believe that this is one of the main reasons why critics loved it. Many of the things I have said here only scratch the surface, Half-Life 2 has immense replayability value. No there isn\u0027t any collectibles, or levels to achieve. But the game, much like a good movie, had many small things that were easily missed. Playing it through for a second time, a player will be more likely to discover these little things. Secret areas, interesting mini-puzzles, and G-Man sitings are a few things that make the game worth playing again and again. I first bought this game four years ago, and it completely blew my mind. I have since replayed it four times now. With every playthrough, I found something new. Half-Life 2 truly is an amazing game. If you are reading this and have ever considered trying it, but never got around to buying it, take my advice: go buy Half-Life 2 right now. I sincerely believe that Half-Life 2 is our generation\u0027s Super Mario Bros., it\u0027s simply a game that will always be remembered. Thanks for reading, Signed: Culture F.… ",

He has a great female companion named Alex Vance who accompanies you in the adventure. Overall the story is brilliantly executed and is pretty damn awesome. There isn\u0027t any multiplayer, but this is a SP experience, and it is one of the best of its kind.

It aint hard to understand if you understand english. 6) the art is soviet era rot, brown and grey and depressing That is because the enviroment is supposed to be depressing. It aint Angry birds you\u0027re playing. 7) the assests look like they are from 2004, you know when videocards had 128mb of ram and people were playing games on the ps2 and original xbox? And don\u0027t forget that this game was made for original xbox. -The game is for 2004, so I guess it looks like it\u0027s from 2004. 8) puzzles involve moving boxes around, and platforming with above mentioned **** controls. All in all, this game just does not stack up to great shooters like like crysis, Stalker, Metro, New Vegas, DayZ, etc. I supose if you are into playing old games like Fallout 1\u00262, Thief, etc., then you\u0027ll like this one. But if you are like me and find old PS2/xbox era games totally unfun, then stay away. YMMV blahblah. -Physics were new at that time.

As someone who has been a fan of Half Life 2 for years, I have never really quit playing it - although I have taken some pretty big breaks in between. It is during my current playthrough that I decided to come write a short review on Metacritic to describe just how I feel about this game. I am sure there isn\u0027t a reputable gamer alive that isn\u0027t fully aware of Half Life 2 and the hype surrounding it. And as beloved as it is, I would still so far as to say that this game is one of the most underrated games of all time. How can a game that is widely considered by many as the greatest shooter to date, and even still by others (such as myself) as the greatest video game period, be underrated? As difficult that would be to explain, it\u0027s equally difficult attempting to convey just how great this game is in so short of space. Indeed, the fact that a game so good can be so under appreciated is something that has baffled me for quite a time. In my humble opinion, no amount of praise or appreciation for Half Life 2 would suffice. What Valve has created is simply a work of art. The visuals, sound, gameplay, and storytelling are of among the best the gaming world had ever seen. It\u0027s incredible just how amazing and groundbreaking was every facet of Half Life 2, in respect to the time it was released, and even more incredible that each groundbreaking aspect was all in the same game. The game that literally had it all. The Beatles of the PC gaming world. The fact that Half Life 2 can still be played today, 8 years later, and can be every bit as impressive as modern shooters (more, in some instances), truly testifies to just how great this game is. This is truly the greatest game ever made.… ",

The puzzles are perfectly timed to break up the action, so you aren\u0027t just shooting things until it gets boring. The addition of the gravity gun later into the game really adds depth and weight to the gameplay as you find yourself clearing hallways of debris and quickly switching to your crowbar to kill head crabs in the places you discover doing so. There are a few annoyances though. First off Squad AI is not broken, but annoying. An example being that Team mates often block doorways or trap you in a corner. Whoever\u0027s idea it was to combine flash light, Sprint and oxygen into one bar needs shooting, It means you can\u0027t sprint with the light on, or even use a light while holding your breath under water.… ",

But despite all that, I definitely enjoyed Half Life 2 less than the previous chapter.

But despite all that, I definitely enjoyed Half Life 2 less than the previous chapter. I wil also say that I started with this chapter and then bought the previous game. First of all, I did like how the game, like I said, is still fresh: the graphics are surprisingly great and the engine is extremely good, and once you get the gravity gun you can exploit the physics of the game at its best. The characters are, for the most part, very remarkable and likeable to interact with, so nothing wrong here, except that maybe some characters disappear and reapper from the plot and will eventually confuse some people (or not). The game is also very balanced in the combats, with a good variety of weapons, a great variety of (very smart) enemies and with also many different situations to play. Infact, the best word to descrive this game, is \"variety\": you\u0027ll have a lot of situations in the game and they all are surprisingly fun to play and hardly bore you (like the boat section and ravenholm, where you will exploit the gravity gun). The story is...interesting...but I tend to get confused at times and I don\u0027t remember really much. And here comes some flaws in my opinion; while the story is good and well written, the game somehow seems very padded because, with some exceptions, the sections seem like a bunch of different parts glued all together! This isn\u0027t a big deal but, because of these sections that look like different parts completely, the story might get confusing, because (like I said) characters might appear and disappear all of the sudden and the story seems to get a halt for a pair of hours (the biggest example to me was the teleporter sceme: it seemed like an excuse to insert another part of the game). While I liked the first game because there wasn\u0027t much to understand, but only much to discover, in here it felt like I needed too much to understand, with nothing to discover at all. Also, this is kinda personal, I never got the links between the first game and this one (one big reason why I HAD to buy the first), but after finishing that game I still don\u0027t know what happened here after the events of the first (especially since that the ending of the first game didn\u0027t look like it had anything to do with the start of this. Except the presence of G-man). Maybe I\u0027m just dumb, so I might be totally wrong on complaining this much. Moving to the combat: while I hated a bit the first game for the unbalance between the enemies (entire magazines to dispatch a few soldiers, while few shots would take down big aliens), this game actually fixes a lot of issues, especially with very well balanced weapons and with enemies that, for what I saw, have weakpoints (a head shots seem to do more damage here). My biggest complain here, is that the weapons aren\u0027t that many, even if there\u0027s the gravity gun. Quality over quantity is always the rule, however we could have used more variety of guns, or have a better thought for using them. For example, one of the rifles is rather bad because of the small magazines, and both of the rifles\u0027 secondary fire is very limited due to the lack of proper ammo; the magnum is great, but I hardly found that many ammo to use it so often; the grenades must be choose apart, while it should have been a button instead, or at least a faster way to choose it. And few weapons won\u0027t be used at all after certain parts, like the pheromone bomb. And while the gravity gun is a great invention, I found it very limited at times and, to be honest, I used it only on one section (Ravenholm), and NEVER used it again, because there was almost no other reason to use it afterwards and, strangely, only a very limited amount of weapons could be used. On the other hand, when it gets powered, things change completely. Just too bad it\u0027s for a brief time. All in all, I liked this game, but I honestly expected much more: while the first one had flaws and could use some more story and more balance, in here the situations don\u0027t always match the story properly, resulting in some unnecessary padding at times, and while it was very innovative for its time (and still kinda is), right now we also have games that took from the innovation that this game made and actually evolved it. Probably I\u0027m just not a fan of this game and opinions will be varied, but it\u0027s still a good game to play and there\u0027s nothing exactly wrong with it. However, if people can\u0027t go past the \"oldness\" of this game, probably it\u0027s better to step away. Or else, give it a try and see for yourself.… ",

The best part of the game is the story and characters, for that it deserves genuine praise. From a 2004 point of view, some aspects were groundbreaking, but fact is, you can\u0027t give a game so much praise just because it\u0027s amazing in some areas, and average in others. I know this isn\u0027t popular opinion, but I genuinely feel this way about the game. Overrated? Yeah, I\u0027d say so. Not too much, but still by a bit.… ",

Half-Life 2 is not only a sequel of a critical acclaimed video game, but is one of the best video games ever made. The plot takes place in the fictional City 17, where Gordon is woken up after his 20yrs long stasis, from original Half-Life, where he finds that the world has changed a lot in his absence, now the Earth being ruled by an unknown alien race called Combine. After the Seven Hour War, the humanity has been willingly enslaved so they will still live, rather than the whole world to be annihilated. However the player later discovers that combine suppression field will prevent them to re-product, so that the current generation is the last one. When Gordon comes back, everybody knows him and what he has done, and practically considered a hero, and a legend. During his journey, once again, this time Gordon doesn\u0027t fight for saving a facility, and the whole world, shortly becoming Combine\u0027s prime target, and in same time, the symbol of freedom for the Resistance. During the plot, the player meets again the iconic characters, and antagonists from the original game, such as Eli Vance, Dr. Breen, but also the xenians that now are friends, headcrabs, zombies, and also several new characters like Alyx Vance, dr. Judith Mossman, who both later will become iconic characters of the sequel. Half-Life 2, beyond the new friends, also features new enemies, such as Antlions, more zombie races, and others. The gameplay is just flawless. As the first one, Half-Life 2 is a FPS, but, same, in which the player will need to solve puzzles to progress in the game, listen at splendid dialogues, and decent, mature and great conflicts. The sequel has the same characteristics, is still linear, but with great replay value. The level design is just astonishing, with detailed buildings, great lightning and water effects, physics, and many others. Most of the weapons from the original game we\u0027re not kept, but many others we\u0027re introduces, such as the 9mm USP Pistol, SMG1 with it\u0027s grenade launcher, spas-12 shotgun, a re-created crossbow and RPG, a BugBait(also called Pheropod), an alien-ish AR2 Rifle, advanced grenades, and the 2 iconic weapons, the crowbar, and the Gravity Gun. As an ,,bonus,, Half-Life 2 also features more usable vehicles, such as Airboats, and Buggies. Beyond the game play mechanics, great level design, unbelievable story, was also introduced one of the best game\u0027s friendly and enemy AI, which are pushed to their limits and skills in both non-scripted events, but scripted as well. Same with the physics, which are shown the same way the AI is, though regular, but scripted sequences as well. After this, Half-Life 2 had a sort of chaotic development, like you\u0027ve seen in E3 2002 gameplay and trailer, the game was totally different than the final product, as it\u0027s been set in a darker future. The original plot can be found in the Raising The Bar Book, which features concept arts, original design and others from Team Fortress, Counter-Strike, And Half-Life(both originals and the sequels). The original plot also inspired many mods, most notable being Missing Information. So, after all this, I guess you all have seen great/good/decent sequels, but there aren\u0027t many that not only live to the expectations, they even surpass them. Half-Life 2 is a great shooter and is a must-own and play.… ",

Much improved graphics, much improved physics, much improved AI, and much improved weapons, most notably the wondrous gravity gun. Once again it mixes a wide variety of spectacular environments with some satisfying puzzles and some fantastic combat. It also develops the story started in the original and fleshes it out nicely. Another important gain is the introduction of Alyx and her father Ely. Alyx will be a welcome companion and will, periodically, fight by your side. This is a big factor in HL2 the introduction of team play. You will have small bands of resistance fighters with you sporadically during play in the single player mode and this adds a team element which greatly increases immersion and the sense that what you do matters. I could bang on about this game for ever and a day, but just let me say this: play it you won’t regret it.… ",

There are too few opportunities to use the gravity gun, the very fun weapon which is really the signature piece of this game. And while I said the guns are very creative, they fall to often under the linear spell where they are used in one situation well and disregarded for the rest of the game.

SIMPLY THE BEST Everything about this game is AWESOME I wasn\u0027t that much of a gamer but when I played the first Half Life I became one. The first one was ok. But when I played the second one, I was Mind blown. First the graphics and physics back then were awesome. The AI was great (although today is way better), the textures were great, the gameplay felt very good. As for the story it was really good and mysterious, with the old characters from the first one and adding some really cool characters. Cant wait for Half Life 3!… ",

The only thing interesting is the Gravity Gun, but that\u0027s also kind of boring because even games like Sonic 06 implemented this combat feature for Silver the Hedgehog. So yes, the combat is meh. The graphics is still pretty good for today if it has improved lighting and better textures. The story is very uninteresting, I also don\u0027t feel attached to characters like Alyx, Barney, and others. Like the part when you are seperated from Alyx and you have to go to Ravenholm. I\u0027m just like, meh I\u0027ll move on. I don\u0027t feel worried of other characters in danger and all that For a game that is supposed to be story driven, it is extremely BAD AT STORY. People say that this game is a physics puzzle game, but guess what? None of the puzzles are hard. All it takes is to stack enough objects on one specific place and move on. Nothing challenging there, so why is it a physics puzzle game? The game is very linear, but also provides some exploring you can do to find hidden pockets of extra health, armor and ammo, which is stupid because you\u0027ll encounter a lot of them on plain sight, so you can survive this game on hard mode without ever finding the hidden supplies. Overall, for today\u0027s standard, it is an average cookie-cutter first person shooter and for $10, it\u0027s good I guess.… ",

Released in 2004 to great fame and accolades, I was but then an 11 year old devotee of Sonic, Metroid, Zelda, and Star Wars. I hardly knew or cared. But as I grew older, and the internet became more prominent in my life, I began to hear of this wonderful thing called Half-Life 2, starring this great hero, a nuclear physicist named Gordon Freeman, who battled against the evil Combine to save humanity from its position under the jackboots of a tyrannical alien regime. When I discovered TvTropes, I got exposed to many more references to this game. I was told of the epic journey of the great hero fighting all alone against the future straight out of Nineteen Eighty-Four. I read that I was supposed to be a critical piece whose actions and choices would decide the fates of billions. I read about leading the citizens in rebellion against their alien oppressors in a climatic battle in City Seventeen. I heard about the awesome Gravity Gun. I read about the fearsome striders. I read about turning the antlions on the invaders. I read about the horror of Ravenholm. I heard about great and memorable characters, an engaging story, and so many other things which sounded like heralds of greatness. I first got my hands on a valve game, Left 4 Dead, in \u002708. And I loved it. I still do, just as I do Left 4 Dead 2. I got The Orange Box in 2010. I got it more or less for Portal. Portal, damn, that game is fantastic. As you would expect, having consecutively played three superb games from Valve, I was very much looking forward to the next game in my sights: Half-Life 2. So I selected it from the main menu of The Orange Box on my Xbox360 and began a new campaign on the medium difficulty setting. I as already an FPS veteran at the time, having played through games like Metroid Prime 1 \u0026 2, Bioshock, Metro 2033, Goldeneye 007, the Halo series, F.E.A.R., Doom, Doom 3, and Quake 4. With everything begun, I was prepared to be blown away. I was eager for the greatest FPS ever made. It sucks. I personally rate games mainly on story, gameplay, and characters, with all of these being roughly equivalent. For me to approve of a game, it has to do well enough in these three categories. However, I ultimately pass judgement based on whether or not the game was fun to me. I can forgive quite a lot of if a game is an entertaining experience. Do I think Half-Life 2 is fun? NO! I think it\u0027s awful. I had to force myself to finish this game. It failed in story, gameplay, and characters. It wasn\u0027t even something that I could enjoy taking the piss out of. I know, you\u0027re probably frothing with rage and confusion over why I think Half-Life 2 is an overrated piece of crap. I\u0027ve heard the arguments from the fans, but I just don\u0027t see it like they do. I respect their opinions, but I disagree. Truth be told, I feel like this game was always very close to being the great experience I was told about. Of course, realistically, nothing could have lived up to the hype. Even though I habitually make a note to deliberately not buy into hype, it was impossible to go in with anything other than great expectations. I could argue that it had to end in disappointment, but I disagree. I\u0027ve played other great games, like Call of Duty 4, Bioshock, Far Cry 3, Metroid Prime 2, Metro: Last Light, and Portal, and felt that they deserved the praise they got. Perhaps not the extravagant fanboy praise, but plenty of praise and accolades nevertheless. Half-Life 2 got so many elements right and had a lot of good ideas, but the execution was so often feeble. If maybe just only a few elements were different, then perhaps I would be raving about how I love this game. And I think that, had I played it when it first came out, or at least within two years of its release rather than six, then I could very well have been much more favorably impressed. I could I personally actually quite like Half-Life 2: Episode 1, which was a much tighter game with a much more interesting and dynamic plotline where the player character actually seems to accomplish things. The story is irritatingly impenetrable while being of only vague concern, and yet still managing to hang constantly over the player while constantly keeping them in the dark. The gameplay is the worst part, given how it fails to make combat fun in a first person shooter while bloating the game to excessive length with vehicles and puzzles. The characters are mostly forgettable with a few good exceptions. Gordon Freeman is the worst possible kind of protagonist for this game. Alex Vance should have been it. The game is not fun except in small doses and in certain parts. Your experience may vary. I would recommend watching a walkthrough or LP rather than spend money on it.… ",

The use of the physics engine as well as the famous gravity gun is particularly commendable. However, the shooting has no weighty feel to it, and weapons don\u0027t have any recoil. Enemies take damage with no seeming impact until they die. The characters are almost non-existent because the game\u0027s lack of cutscenes prevents any real development in the story. At every point when you play Half-Life 2, you feel like you\u0027re using compiled C code rather than playing a video game. It just feels like software that\u0027s made for a specific purpose. Although the voice acting, lip-syncing and attention to detail in the environments are all top notch, the main gameplay of Half-Life 2 is just plain bland and boring despite the varied levels.

There is so much to say, and the true greatness of this game cannot be expressed in a simple review. After playing through this game, you look back and just want to play it again, to experience it all over again. Even today, Half-Life 2 still holds up in the \u0027looks\u0027 department, running on Valve\u0027s truly amazing Source engine. What makes Half-Life 2 so great, you might ask? What makes this game from 2004 still one of the best games ever made? Let me indulge you. As a preface to this review, I implore you to play the original Half-Life. Otherwise, this review may be a little confusing. Although playing Half-Life is not needed to understand Half-Life 2, it certainly helps in terms of the story line. The game begins with a greeting from \u0027G-Man\u0027, a familiar face from the previous Half-Life games that can be seen wandering throughout Black Mesa in Half-Life. After G-Man ends his tidings, you awaken on a tram headed for \u0027City 17\u0027.You have no idea why you are on the tram, or what you are doing, but you know that something is afoot. You are Gordon Freeman, a bearded scientist that used to work at Black Mesa as a physicist. This brings me to \u0027point one\u0027, of what makes this game truly great. Instead of being a burly super-human bullet sponge trooper with the \u0027generic rifle 9000\u0027 strapped to your back, you play a mute physicist. Yes, a mute physicist. This makes it a lot easier to get immersed into the game and feel like you are Gordon Freeman. This is enhanced by the fact that Freeman does not speak throughout the course of the game, allowing you, the player, to think what you wish and not be told what you are thinking by your character bursting out in song. The story line of Half-Life 2 is a wonder to play. I won\u0027t spoil any of it for you, you\u0027ll have to experience it for yourself. A myriad of characters help Freeman on his way, fleshing out the world and making the places Freeman explores seem alive... or dead, as the case may be. Brilliant voice acting from all of the cast puts the cherry on the cake and does wonders to immerse you in the story of Gordon Freeman. But what about gameplay? Surely gameplay is the most important thing in a GAME. Don\u0027t fret Half-Life 2\u0027s gameplay is some of the best in any game. Ever. Forget lousy 2 gun limits and boring AK-47s Freeman can carry a whole truckload of weapons and grenades; all tuned to fit in with the setting and the world. From the early pistol to the RPG and the combine weaponry, the guns in Half-Life 2 do not disappoint. The weapons feel good too they have a nice oomph to them and feel like they should as well as the animations being great across the board. Even by today\u0027s standards. And we\u0027re talking about a game that\u0027s almost 10 years old. But, it\u0027s not just guns. Oh no. Ohhhhh no. A bit into the game, you get the Gravity Gun the star of the show. With this beauty, you can lift and throw physics objects. This may seem boring at first, but wait until you pick up a buzzsaw and shoot it at that headcrab, splitting it in two. That feels awesome. But, it\u0027s not just a one-gun show. Throughout different levels, you get different, cool weapons to try. At one point, your Gravity Gun even becomes supercharged, letting you throw PEOPLE. Yes, you pick up enemies and throw them at each other. What more can I say about this game? You owe it to yourself to play this if you haven\u0027t already. Log on to, or get Steam, and go buy it now. You\u0027ll thank me later. Trust me. This game is truly worthy of its legendary status in the hearts of many gamers. You don\u0027t even need a beast PC to play it either. As I said, 2004. You can run it. Trust me. 10/10. From the heart. One of the best games ever made. \"Wake up, Mr. Freeman. Wake up, and smell the ashes.\"… ",

As you play, you will see the characters develop and you will start to care about them and how they interact. The whole game being a long continuous level is also really cool as you can clearly see how the whole game links together. If I were to nitpick the game, the vehicle sections are a little too long, especially the car levels, but this is just a minor complaint really.

The game artfully exemplifies a precipiced human race beset with the horror of a xenocratic dystopia whilst also providing interaction and levity with relatable characters, both central and minor. From the very outset, I was immersed in the eerie mystique of the opening characters and the ostensibly artificial setting. The player\u0027s character, Gordon Freeman, never speaks, nor does he need to; his humanity and heroism become progressively apparent as the player completes the game, despite the perennial air of mystery he conveys. The immersive realism of the game is brilliantly augmented by precise and complex game physics, impressive facial animation, and the perpetual necessity for the player to utilise his environment to complete chapters, rather than the gameplay being excessively linear and unchallenging. The dark, tyrannical undertones of the game stir the player to empathise with the plight of the fledgling resistance movement and become further psychologically involved in the plot. Half-Life 2 is gripping, stimulating and revolutionary. I wholeheartedly recommend it.… ",

Along with all of this, the game looks and runs very well. The game had minor faults. Some areas would feel a little too long, i found myself really only using the shotgun and SMG, the other weapons I would use only once my ammo ran out. The rocket launcher I used basically when I absolutely needed to e.g when trying to take down a helicopter. The ending was great, but left more questions than answers.

I can\u0027t stop playing Half Life 2!!! So much mystery and Half Life 2 has the best gameplay. Half Life 2 has a really good weapon\u0027s sounds and you can kind of feel the weapon like it\u0027s in your hands. There are really great characters like Alyx, Barney and other people you meet, and there are some characters that you want to beat up like Dr. Breen and G-Man. Guns are awesome too. I can\u0027t believe that in the end of the game they also take your normal Gravity Gun and make it a Super Gravity Gun. And The only thing I might not really like is that you don\u0027t have a sniper rifle, but it\u0027s good that Valve at least put a crossbow in the game. I also like the physics. Source made this game awesome and the graphics are still better than some games we play today!!!… ",

Half Life 2 is just one of those games that gets everything right. To find fault, one must look pretty hard. Valve brilliantly incorporated it\u0027s source engine in their true masterpiece. When you find truly good games, you of ten find things put in by the developers to enhance the realism. For example, in Metroid Prime, Samus\u0027s reflection can be seen during flashes of light and certain events. She also interacts with her arm cannon if you wait around long enough, creating the whole image that Samus isn\u0027t just what you tell her to do. This is evident in HL2 in spades. Explosions deafen you, guns wield realistically, and infinite amounts of care went into character\u0027s expressions and tone of voice. This game is truly an instant classic that has an amazing story, well developed characters, awesome gameplay, and truly impressive depth. This game is good to the core.… ",

But then I got to experience the physics. The Source engine is really a brilliant piece of work, the way everything was moving and living really made my jaw drop. And with all these beautiful and functional graphics came an immensely intense gaming experience. Half-Life 2 focused more on the story side than its predecessor, almost every G-Man speech remained in your memory and made you really take a step back and think about all the things that happened already in the Half-Life universe. Amazing gameplay from the first game stayed and got even better because of all the new features brought by the new engine. The most anticipated game in my life did not disappoint me, this is a real must-play, which gives you no other choice in rating the game. 10/10 for my second most favourite game of all time.… ",

While it continues the same classic formula of run and gun rail shooter, it however goes back in several areas. While it has more of a storyline than Half-Life, its just not very interesting. The combine are perhaps the most bland enemy I\u0027ve ever seen, the key problem is they are unmemorable. Like a weaker version of the Strogg (from Quake). While it has the best physics (which makes sense as you are Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist). The game took a nose dive into a completely different locale. The claustrophobia of underground research facility is gone, and some classic aliens don\u0027t make a come back (bullsquid/hound eye)... and Vortiguants are friendly -_- The game also noticeably lacks difficulty, even on hard the game is perhaps the easiest I\u0027ve ever played. Less explosive barrels - Half-Life 1 had a perfect balance. Every time I saw a barrel in Half-Life 2 I knew someone was going to either go near it or hide behind it. Less health kits, once again HL1 had a perfect balance.. here I always find 2-3 to many. Those unlimited ammo/grenade supply crates where so unnecessary. The mediocre AI.. I want the AI to find ways to circle around me and trap me in corners, flush me out with grenades. The airboat portion in Half-Life 2 was dragged on far too long. In between each section you kill a few easy metro cops and then on you go... like some sort of tech demo. +Gameplay is fun, and level design is logical +Ergonomically designed, so you can play the whole in one sitting +Characerisation +Very long +Ravenholm -Easy game, even on Hard -Bland enemy design for the combine -Unmemorable music -Mediocre AI -Physics puzzles brought FPS a interesting twist, but I thought that they really didn\u0027t do anything substantial to move the genre forward. Instead it feels like a technical achievement rather than the merging of FPS gameplay and physics in some meaningful way. Using the physics gun to launch objects at enemies is about as far as it goes in this regard. I think future games to come end up achieving something like this more so. -Why does Gordon have to be a silent protagonist? I feel like it\u0027s more a crutch on the story.… ",

HL2: Episode 2 was \"In my opinion\" even better then both Episode 1 and HL2, it has AMAZING story telling, and character development, The ending is FANTASTIC to start up HL3 which i now understand is so needed by many gamers.

Seriously; you don\u0027t even need to READ a review to play this wonderful game made back in that period where you still loved Half life. From early betas, to the current state, I still love this master piece that will be standing forever into the ashes of old and good games. This outstanding shooter will never bored from playing it over multiple times. After all, where should I start? Characters are very well made, not that good graphics for that period but who needed them on that type of small monitors? The voice acting is one of the best and gives you the feeling that they\u0027re really there talking live to you! They have also a great plot into their own minds, body and flesh. Makes you wanna stick around and love them. Gordon Freeman, the main character, doesn\u0027t speak at all but that gives you the idea to think like him, for yourself, not him for you. The soundtrack should have the Pulitzer Prize for great performance and I still like the songs today. The story is one of the best one I ever met into a video game (FPS). The Half Life Trilogy is sent from 2000s all the way to 2030s. The Seven Hour War in 2012/2013, also having a great appetite for me in the idea of Half Life. Too bad they didn\u0027t release a game where you take part of it LIVE and seeing the world going to hell. Graphics aren\u0027t the best ones but for that time, they were rocking hard. The physics are GREAT and makes the game need-to-play. Facial animations are great even in beta where I noticed they looked like the same in the current game, but with no voice acting. The weapons are told to be human and Combine, some even Combineized. Adding extra attachments for their use of power. This game may have some little bugs over there and over here but it won\u0027t stop you from playing it as long you\u0027re not activating console cheats and exploiting the trigger on the maps! You may play the game again as you did read this review. Doesn\u0027t matter; it\u0027s all up to you, my friends.… ",

The ending is one of the worst I\u0027ve seen in a game. It does nothing that endings are supposed to do (wrap the story up, answer an unanswered question or two, etc). The gameplay, while fun, is quite linear. If you\u0027re looking for something like Fallout (or even the GTA line), you won\u0027t find it here. The AI is pretty poor as well. Friendlies will pretty much either follow you, or charge the enemy, which means they are either in your way, or dead. Having worked with the mapping software a bit, I can see the enemy AI is only decent if you have a fairly linear level (you know where the player is coming from), and you take plenty of time to set up \"cover points\" and such. If you don\u0027t specify where the NPCs can find cover, they pretty much operate on the same AI level as the friendly NPCs. As for the good parts, there are a good number. As I said, the gameplay, though linear, is very fun. There are a number of weapons that will fit most players\u0027 playing styles. The graphics are the peak of current generation games, along with great implementation. The game also works fine on a wide variety of systems. It will run decent on a 5 year old computer, yet can make full use of a new powerhouse computer. As a last note, one of the best parts of the Source (and previously the Half-life) engine is its modability. Through these mods, developers can create a single or multiplayer experience that fixes all the gripes I have about the game, besides the storyline. Overall, I would recommend this game as a \"must-buy\", as what the game doesn\u0027t have out of the box, others can do for it.… ",

I played this game a long time ago on the orange box for the PS3. TBH it didn\u0027t stick back then. Years later I played the game on PC, after playing the first game, and I was shocked at how good it was. First the game\u0027s physics is superb. It\u0027s a lot of fun to drop enemies and watch their death throes as you take them down. It\u0027s such a simple thing yet Valve does such an excellent job at it thanks to the physics of the game which few games out there will ever be able to come close to. That also brings me to the gravity gun. A weapon that will become your best friend upon receiving it. It can snatch and throw objects and can be used on the fly with a simple push of a button when using any other weapon making it a handy gun for breaking and moving obstacles or busting open the many supply crates in the game. Now for the games story. The story is pretty straight forward. In the beginning of the game you show up at City 17, ruled over by Dr. Breen the former administrator to Black Mesa in the previous game. Dr. Breen is essentially a puppet for a transhuman race know as the Combine to ensure domination of the human race by the Combine who rule the human race with totalitarian brutality. The story\u0027s narrative is non-cinematic in nature yet it manages to tell the story with crisp clarity. Constant control over Freeman in each of the non-action story sequences deliver a great sense of immersion few games have. In terms of gameplay the game does an excellent job at balancing great face-paced action and slower non-action sequences to give gamer a quick breather before pushing onwards in their epic journey. The gameplay sequences are also rather superb and varied. One moment you\u0027re on a dune buggy dodging antions, another you\u0027re trying to outrun and destroy a relentless chopper, in another sequence you\u0027re fighting zombies in a dark overrun town. The variety keeps the game unpredictable and fun, and with great gameplay freedom, along with a great arsenal of weapons, you bring down the house however you see fit. The game moves at a great pace and its one of the few games that I\u0027d play again just for the sheer experience of it. The superb narrative, graphics, gameplay freedom and physics make the game a true masterpiece that will stand proud among the best games the gaming industry has to offer. Few come close to the masterpiece that is Half Life 2. Long live Dr. Freeman!… ",

The puzzles, the chill-factor, and the thing that gets me the most, the absolute and complete absorption that you\u0027ll have playing this game is something like no other. You become Gordon Freeman, you live in the world of Half-Life which has been so magnificently created you believe every minute of its being and existence.

StillI know I am treading well-worn ground, here, but Half Life 2 is one of the few games I’ve played that has lived up to the hype surrounding it. I felt like I had to tip my hat, because it is perfect in every appreciable way. Even though HL2 is a decade old, I only recently got around to playing it thanks to a Steam sale. Absolutely fantastic. I love everything about this game. Still looks gorgeous, not at all dated like the first Half Life game. Voice acting is spot-on. Mechanics are good. Nice selection of weapons without having TOO many. Gravity gun is a blast. Music is used very well: long stretches of silence with appropriately creepy or intense electronic tunes depending on what’s happening. What pushes this over the top for me, though, is the story. It was barely there in Half Life 1. You still have no idea what’s happening in HL2 but you discover bits \u0026 pieces as you play. At one of the resistance HQs, for example, there is a bulletin board full of newspaper clippings about the alien invasion which took place while Gordon was…elsewhere. It’s a nice payoff which helps everything else happening in the game make sense. Aside from that, you may only hear certain plot points once or twice from NPC banter. Even if the banter doesn’t contain any story information, though, it’s all scripted well and fun to listen to. HL2 also appeals to gamers who only play shooters for the pew pew and don’t care about story. The maps may be linear (which I don’t mind in a shooter) but you have a lot of freedom and fun ways to go about solving them. There is also a nice mix of gameplay elements which keep things fresh, from turret defense moments (literally) to vehicle driving. You’re not always marching through hallways so it’s very difficult to get bored. The only complaint I have is that there’s no Half Life 3! Of course, I’d rather have an excellent series which rarely releases games than a series that releases a title every year and beats everything we liked about it into the ground until we can’t stand it any longer (*cough*Assassin’s Creed*ahem*). Half Life 2 is one of those amazing gems that is still as good today as it was on the day it was released. Definitely a game which everyone who considers themselves a gamer should play.… ",

So, ok, I\u0027ll look at it as it was back in 2004 and I\u0027ll say how it stands today. The atmosphere is incredible. The soundtrack is really memorable, the graphics were awesome in 2004 (maybe not as beautiful as FarCry, but still...) and the whole universe presented to us is well created. It just... feels real, and the team seemed to draw much inspiration from books like 1984. And I love 1984. The whole concept of a dystopian world amuses me. Of course, the graphics have not aged that well, but the world the game presents is still very memorable, and still is very atmospheric. Few games do that nowadays. I can think only of Batman: Arkham series, Bioshock and maybe The Last of Us, but I have not played the last. The gameplay, for me, at last, is not as good as Half Life 1. The weapons lack some punch, but the enemies are fun to deal with (although it\u0027s a shame that they scraped some enemies from HL1). And the gravity gun, oh man... The gravity gun is so awesome that I never seen such a cool weapon in any other game. It\u0027s a game-changing weapon, and it was there also to showcase the realistic physics engine. And the Half Life series always had such a great pacing. Calm moments. Exploration moments. And really fast-paced moments. And the game plays really well on all of them. And that\u0027s thanks to the amazing level design, which is as good as the first game, if not a little better. The story is pretty simple, and much people complain about Gordon being idolatred by everyone... but, c\u0027mon, he saved the **** planet Earth, and he is just a theoretical scientist, who barely know how to use a gun. And the journey of the hero is a bit clichéd, but you actually FEEL like you are saving the world. I mean... let\u0027s look at Master Chief, for example. I kinda like Halo. And Master Chief saves the **** galaxy, but I don\u0027t feel like I\u0027m really doing it. It\u0027s like \"oh, I\u0027m saving the galaxy, ok\". And Half Life there\u0027s a feeling of desperation, and it is all very subtle at the same time. It\u0027s really damn nice. And the story tells you so much with so little... there are still few games that do this today. And, this time, I can only think of Bioshock. Few clues in the environment that tell a much bigger story. That\u0027s something more games should seek to do. So, yeah... to me, it\u0027s not as good as the first one, but it is an amazing experience if you enjoy first person shooters. And even if you don\u0027t like the genre, you should give it at least a try. Half Life 2 is one of the best games of the 2000\u0027s, and has a perfect balance between old mechanics (huge weapons limit, frenetic gameplay, absence of iron sights, level exploration, puzzles) and new mechanics (story-driven game, changes in pacing, search for a somewhat realistic universe). So... try it once you can! You won\u0027t regret it. The worst that can happen is to you find it boring, but it\u0027s not gonna piss you off.… ",

A good game tells you very little so you\u0027re left wanting to know what the story is. HL2 does the exact opposite. Unskippable cut scene after unskippable cut scene. Instead of googling to find what the story is, I\u0027m googling to see if there is some console command to skip the stupid cut scenes. I can\u0027t believe someone at Valve actually thought it was a good idea to force players to watch the same crap every time they play the game. Start a new game - hey I wonder if that face hugger is going to screw up the teleportation this time. I\u0027ll need to watch the 5 minute cut scene to find out! -It seems like large segments of the game are unfinished. Half of the game is driving or walking, but there\u0027s nothing going on. There\u0027s nothing to shoot and there\u0027s nothing shooting at me. Why was this left in the game? It\u0027s like they forgot to add monsters and nobody in beta testing noticed how boring those sections of the game are. -Physics are completely broken. You can run 100mph in reverse just by running backward and jumping. At least bunny hopping from quake took some practice. -The guns seem a lot crappier than they were in HL1. The amount of ammo one can hold has also been greatly reduced. -HL1 was awesome because it was straight forward. It told a story without telling you anything. An experiment goes wrong, monsters appear, military try to cover the whole thing up, etc. HL2 is about.... what exactly? it\u0027s about running through water canals because a guy in a turtle neck sweater is the leader of some people who wear gas masks. This is Metal Gear Solid level of bad story telling. Snake, you have nanobots inside you because blah blah clones Big Boss blah blah The Combine blah blah turtle neck sweaters. You can\u0027t truly grasp how boring this game is until you watch someone do a speed run of it. Then watch someone do a speed run of Quake.

I\u0027d say that unless you\u0027re one of those people who hates a game that isn\u0027t constant action then play this game just for the experience alone. I only really have one problem that is that the allies you get aren\u0027t very clever and don\u0027t seem to have a sense of self preservation. All of the NPCs seem to rely very heavily on Gordan Freeman to the point where you have to wonder how the resistance survived before he showed up. But this is just one thing that you won\u0027t really notice while playing because this isn\u0027t a game it\u0027s an experience that everyone should have!… ",

I remember, I loved this game back then, it had some awesome graphics which was well optimised as well, and loved the different uniqe parts (ie. driving a buggy, etc.). Now, the game is basically OK, but it has a lot of flaws. First, it happened to me a lot that I got stuck in some terrain object/wall piece/etc., which is pretty frustrating in the middle of combat. The \"helpers\" are more like a pain in the @ss rather than helpful, they are always in the wrong place and one just can\u0027t move freely because of them (especially in the heat of a battle). But my biggest concern is the story: throughout the game, I didn\u0027t have a clue what is happening. It was always like \"Run, Gordon!\" \"You have to go to place B!\" and so on. And there are no cutscenes or other story telling points, only your companions, who tell you you have to do this and do that. It was just a big running, with lot of fights, but for what and why, it was not clear to me. So it\u0027s still a good game which is worth playing, but I think it\u0027s just overhyped - there are lot of others which I played through more times and enjoyed more.… ",

This game would be better fitted as a book, to be honest. It tells a great story, but the gameplay is just so agonizing that I couldn\u0027t get past 40 minutes. If you want a good first person shooter, go play Far Cry or Call of Juarez: Gunslinger. Don\u0027t buy into the hype about this relic. It was good when it launched, but it\u0027s just dog **** that\u0027s beloved by nostalgia-blinded neckbeards who have probably never gotten to 1st base.

Speaking of puzzles, HL 2\u0027s few physics based puzzles are simple and effective at giving a brief relaxation after the intense skirmishes. Looking at the actual shooter aspect, HL 2 more than passes the grade. Aiming is done without much difficulty and you are presented with a new gun type after a while which keeps things a little more interesting. The only flaw I could find was that controlling the vehicles went somewhat awkward, but you can\u0027t blame a game as old as this for that.

If Half-Life was a revolution, Half-Life 2 was more a further refinement of that revolution. The consequence of this is that Half-Life 2 is significantly better than the first chapter, which was already a masterpiece. The most amazing thing of Half-Life 2 is, of course, the gameplay: for an fps is just perfect. Already the first chapter was very advanced for its time, but Half-Life 2 went even further. One example is the way the game has used physics (thanks to the Source Engine) to offer one of the best weapons in the history of video games: the Gravity Gun. The Gravity Gun is the apotheosis of all that an fps has to offer. It is a crude but powerful weapon, fun to use and above all original. It is an example of how everything around you, in a game, is alive if you only try to touch it. This, by the way, is also possible without Gravity Gun, but without it is less fun. Another way of how Half-Life 2 has pushed beyond the standards is the introduction of puzzle elements, simple but fun, in a context with which apparently had nothing to do. Place some batteries to provide power to a gate and open it, may seems like silly but not in an fps game. Even using the Gravity Gun to take a rotating blade, or an heavy box, and launching it against an enemy is the art of using the enviroment as a weapon, and it is fantastic. Other weapons that have gave an higher gear to Half-Life 2 were some like the Pheropods to control Antlions, or the Overwatch Standard Issue Pulse Rifle. It is so cool aesthetically. And the way it shoots, the way it recharge as well. The secondary attack was brilliant and was based on a fantastic physics and bounce mechanism. It was a weapon really fun to use. Last but not least important step forward made by Half-Life 2 (and soon followed by fps games came later) was the introduction of large open spaces where the player could really feel free to move, to experiment, to explore. The difficulty level was generally good and the enemy AI was great and when they were in large groups could get you in trouble. Just perfect as I said. Personally I found the story of Half-Life 2 fantastic and also higher than the story of the first chapter. The setting in Eastern Europe was really beautiful. The game begins exactly from where the first chapter ends, but compared to the first chapter, Half-Life 2 has brought up more raw and human issues such as slavery, despair, infertility, redemption and hope. I appreciated very much the vision that the game give of Gordon Freeman: his fate, his stasis and his connection with the G-Man, his return as a prophecy, his eyes green as hope, the man who goes back and saves the day, a man of few words as Alyx Vance said, The One Free Man (nice language-game with his own name). All this just to describe one of the greatest and most charismatic characters in video game history. A special praise goes to other characters in the game such as the G-Man, Eli and Alyx Vance, Dog, Dr. Breen and especially to the Combine that are among the greatest villains ever seen in a game. The graphics of the game was impressive at the time, and it was even 10 years later when I played it. The Source Engine realized everything perfectly, from the characters to the environments, from weapons to the shadows. But what amazed me the most was the detail in the faces, facial expressions, dubbing and lip sync that were just perfect. Half-Life 2 is a majestic game. Valve gave one of the examples of what can be done when the videoludic art pushes the limits in all its forms. A timeless classic.… ",

The higher the hype, the higher the expectations, and rarely does anything live up to it’s hype. Half-Life 2 however, does. Half- Life 2 is a near perfect first person shooter with star wars level of innovation. I didn’t really understand what was going on in the game and why it was going on. The story and its characters couldn’t keep my attention at all, everything pertaining to the story seemed so generic to me, luckily though the gameplay is good enough on its own to take you through the 10 plus hour journey. Half-Life 2 is a very linear game, but at the same time every section of the game feels connected, it feels open world… you hardly ever feel like you are bread crumbed to the finish.. When you find passages you feel like it was your work, when really the game cleverly got you there with its carefully constructed design. The pacing is nearly perfect you’re slowly hand fed new weapons.. you’ll get to a point in the game where you’re introduced to a new weapon and then instantly have to use it for what its intended for, this is a perfect way to get you accustomed to and comfortable with everything at your disposal and prevent you from wasting unnecessary ammo. There wasn’t one weapon or item given that I wasn’t thankful for or that I didn’t find useful. This is great considering you’ll find yourself in some spots out of a particular set of ammo. The game play is also varied, so you’re not quite sure what to expect. Some games find a formula and stick to it. Half Life 2 doesn’t do this one minute you’re playing a stealth shooter, the next moment you’re playing call of duty style taking out troops, and 2 hours later you’re cruising through the world with vehicle based combat only to end up at a horror game style section This variation keeps the game from ever feeling like a grind, but at the same time the stress is kept at a near maximum. You won’t find too much challenge outside of the final few chapters, but the constant feeling of survival mode will definitely have you stepping away for a few hours or days. I now understand why everyone wants half-life 3 so bad. I loved climbing through every hole not knowing who or what would meet me on the other side. Half-Life 2 is a must play for gamers to experience the magic every developer has been chasing since 2004 For what it is First person shooter – 9.5/10 Overall: 9.5/10… ",

As a modern gamer who has played most of the top-rated games out there, I was curious about this title. Gradually, it blew me away Initially, I thought that the game was overrated. Considering I haven\u0027t played Half-Life 1, the game was a bit unappealing. Take that with the gunplay being a bit on the plain side, and I thought I was in for a long haul of datedness. I deleted the game and forgot about it for months. But when I played it for the second time, its constantly thrilling gunplay, well-made levels, weird \u0026 wonderful creatures and lively animations opened up to me. The game did many things opposing the norm: no cutscenes, physics-based puzzles in an FPS game, and ahead-of-its-time graphics and mechanics. The physics are still better than most games today and killing hundreds upon hundreds of enemies doesn\u0027t get repetitive as you might think because of it. Its story polarized me. Upon perusing Half-Life 1\u0027s synopsis, the story became very interesting. I just wish there was more of it. The game seems to focus more on gameplay and environments, as you blast and drive your way through the Combine. Speaking of that, the universe boasts a fascinating backdrop that treats its audience intelligently, letting you figure out the state of the world yourself. That\u0027s something you rearely see in games before or since HL2 came out. I agree that Half-Life 2 is one of the best FPSs of all-time, and to an extent, one of the greatest overall games. On the other hand, I do think that people mostly attribute this because of HL2\u0027s revolutionary influence. I know you can say the same about the film Citizen Kane, but I think that films don\u0027t get as dated as video games, since they are not virtually produced. I may not think that this game is top 10-20 worthy, but I have put it in my top 40 almost instantly, just like how I completed the game. The game does grab you, and surely enough, the experience is nearly as powerful as a headcrab grabbing you. You try to run, but the thing leaps on to you, and you\u0027re stuck in its immense grasp.… ",

The game is fast paced, tense and ultra-responsive. The game makes ample use of physics and it is still fun to interact with them to this day . There are some genuinely fun sections and the overall design of the levels feels fresh, playful, and rarely repetitive Ironically, the main reason for which this game is regarded as one of the best FPS of all time, is precisely because shooting is far from being the only scope of the game. That said, the game suffers from some serious pacing issues, where certain sections are dragged way too long to the point of annoyance. This game could have easily been 30% shorter and that would have made it that much more enjoyable. The visuals are clean and easy on the eyes yet the overall audio-visual experience is quite dull; Half-life 2 is just not a very pretty game, it has never been. Pair that with a lackluster story, and few annoying design choices, and you end up with an experience that despite being remarkable in more than a few ways is hard to qualify as anything more than \"pretty good\". So here you have it, Half-Life 2 is a pretty good game that is commendable in many respects and despite not being deprived of charm, ultimately fails to inspire.… ",

The atmosphere, the smooth (and I mean it when I say smooth) gameplay, the diverse characters and enemies, the physics puzzles, the environment in general, the story, the set pieces! I could go on and on, as a matter of fact, so many have done just that on metacritic and, well, anywhere else. Also, for a game made in 2004, these graphics are SUPERB. Don\u0027t get me wrong, if you are unfortunate enough to still not have played this software, when you do, it should be easy to see it is a masterpiece. The big bad shooters of today have got their own thing going on. Call of Duty, Halo, Battlefield, and such are okay, but to be honest, when I play these games I don\u0027t really care about the game itself. It just doesn\u0027t seem fun to me. They just don\u0027t seem to possess that pizzazz that half life 2 carries. And really, to me, how fun it is is a pretty damn important part of a game. Still don\u0027t agree? Okay. Not every single person is going to enjoy the same game. But I must say, the half life series, in addition to most if not all of Valve\u0027s other well-known games, definitely deserves the massive fanbase that it has. Half life 2 has left a permanent mark on the history of video games and will be remembered for a very, very long time.… ",

Seu motor grafico é utilizado até hoje, como por exemplo, em Counter-Strike: Global Offensive e até jogos sem ser da Valve (como TitanFall,Left 4 Dead e outros).

Услышал я про неё впервые ещё лет 8 назад, играл в демку, да и забил. Но вдруг решил пройти классику. Ниже мнение человека, который не проходил игру в 2004, 2005... а только в 2016, в конце 2016. Я не ньюфаг, прошёл игру с удовольствием, местами было скучновато, местами очень весело и эпично. -Геймплей тут вполне стандартный. Он неплох, но местами, а точнее ближе к концу, он становится довольно скучноват. До середины игры дают покататься на 2-х транспортных средствах- багги и лодка на воздушной подушке, довольно неплохое разнообразие игрового процесса. Плавно перейдём к физике. Физика шикарна до сих пор, а в 2004 просто взрыв мозга... , но порой она выдаёт такие нелепости или странности, что немного не по себе. вообщем за геймплей 7,5-8/10 -Сюжет довольно интересный. Диалоги было интересно слушать, а финал так и вообще очень крутой вышел. А лицевая анимация просто шик, тоже до сих пор смотрится улётно, а в 2004... За сюжет 8/10. -Атмосфера и музыка. Атмосфера тут бывает настолько разная, что диву даёшься. То это налёт хоррора, повсюду какие-то хлюпания, шорохи, темнота. То это атмосфера одиночества, едешь по дороге на той же машине, а на ней никого, вокруг только горы и океан. Ну и атмосфера пост-апокалипсиса. Музыка хороша, порой задаёт тонус вести дальнейшую битву, она довольно динамична, местами просто расслабляет. 9/10 за атмосферу и музыку. Вообщем на данный момент игра всё ещё ОЧЕНЬ хороша, если вы не играли в неё и вы не ньюфаг, не презираете старые игры, а любите их, то я настоятельно рекомендую данную игру, кто знает, может она станет одной из ваших любимых! 2004- 9-9,5/10 2016- 8/10… ",

This is almost thirteen years from its release, and since those reading the reviews on here are likely those seeing if it is worth playing today, I will base it as if it came out today. Half Life 2 is a game that goes on, and on, and on...and on. It\u0027s extremely rare that a game does that whileI am reviewing this game based on TODAY\u0027S standards, and the date today is March 13, 2017. This is almost thirteen years from its release, and since those reading the reviews on here are likely those seeing if it is worth playing today, I will base it as if it came out today. Half Life 2 is a game that goes on, and on, and on...and on. It\u0027s extremely rare that a game does that while avoiding repetition. One game that comes to mind that did this successfully is Resident Evil 4. I\u0027m afraid to say Half Life 2 is no Resident Evil 4. Half Life 2 struggles to keep itself interesting after the first chapter. The game begins in a train station, in an Orwellian type world with guards, and it is immersive realistic and atmospheric. It was the best start-off to a game I\u0027ve ever played. But it went downhill fast. The guns are very standard and basic, most are very boring. And there\u0027s no variety. All the handguns feel the same, the machine guns are very basic and offer an alternate firing weapon (one a grenade and the other a ricocheting energy orb) and there\u0027s one shotgun. The big draw of the game for many was the Gravity Gun, which utilizes a revolutionary (at the time) physics engine. You can gravitate large barrels or pieces of wood or, well anything you can find really, no matter how heavy, and launch at your enemies. You will use it to solve puzzles. I would recommend looking at at YouTube video at this gun in action. But, no matter how cool a gun is, if the gameplay is boring, then everything else gets affected, no matter great or innovative. Half Life 2 is LONG, and thus variety should have been used to keep things interesting. Well, with little variety used, it isn\u0027t interesting. The story isn\u0027t interesting. The weapons aren\u0027t interesting. The combat is the most repetitive I\u0027ve ever played, and it seems to never end. There are stages where you will ride a hover boat and a buggy car, but even those dragged on too long. I would have preferred Half Life 2 rely more on puzzles and story than its shooting, but Half Life 2 IS a shooter after all, first and foremost. The sound design is very precise. Atmospheric music will be cued at really mind-hitting times to really drive the immersion. It was quite well done, but I would have preferred to have had music all the way through out like in 007 Goldeneye. It would have helped the boringness of the game. All in all, this is an important game. It\u0027s a game everyone should play just to experience what was hailed at the time as a technological achievement. This game has and will remain in the video game history books as deeply significant, iconic, and necessary. Just don\u0027t expect to have a blast playing it in today\u0027s modern game world. While today\u0027s gaming isn\u0027t better, it does force classic games to show their age, and in this case it was bad.… ",

There are some highlights, the more scripted parts where the characters interact with one another was the most interesting part about the game but I wish I got more of that. The gameplay was fun but it did have flaws, the level design was smart and well done and weapons like the gravity gun are fun to use...but most of the other weapons are generic and boring making the game sometimes repetitive and the driving sections are atrocious.

No... Half-Life 2 is not the best game ever made, it is not even a classic. It is, however, a fairly good game with good sound and atmosphere, average story and shooting physics and some spectacular graphics for its time. There are some chapters that are too long, such as the ones where you use an airboat, in which the game feels more like a tech demo where the devs are trying to impress. And the worst thing about the game, a huge minus, is that Half-Life 2 will likely give you nausea. In some chapters I felt sick and my face went pale. I have been playing shooters forever, never have I suffered a nausea in a game, which I believe indicates some serious design mistakes.… ",

You\u0027ll be challenged with HL2\u0027s enemies, scary, shocking and all fun to fight, and a weapon system that is just so amazing. It inspired a generation of FPS, and it\u0027s praise isn\u0027t going to stop.

Well, it\u0027s time to forget about that, because Half-Life 2 has arrived. And, in many ways, this big-budget sequel does what it sets out to do: Half-Life 2 is a technically amazing, sharply honed first-person shooter that pulls all the tricks that made Half-Life such a beloved experience. With that said, many of those tricks feel more than a bit familiar now, and the game itself is saddled with a disappointing story. Still, that doesn\u0027t stop Half-Life 2 from being a very impressive and engaging shooter, and a faithful follow-up to one of the greatest PC games of all time.… ",

Я всегда считал Half-Life 2 (да и Half-Life) полноценной научной фантастикой. Такого рода игры мне по нраву и можно сказать то, что серия игр Half-Life продлила мне этот путь любви к научной фантастике. Говоря про инновации, то да, для своего времени это было нечто. Движок, на который кстати потом перенесли оригинальный Half-Life впечатлял бесконечно. Вся эта плавность при игре была на столько заметна, что хотелось играть и играть (думаю олдфаги спокойно проходят игру за одну сессию). Сюжет держал в напряжении на протяжении всего прохождения, лично мне нравилось это чувство, оно у меня осталось ещё с Half-Life. Если говорить про геймлей, то тут ляжет в основу движок, ибо \"плавность\" (кто играл тот знает о чем я, а кто нет - то обязательно сыграйте и тоже все поймете). Я всегда считал серию игр Half-Life за полноценный одиночный сеттинг (бродить одному), но даже в таких играх персонажи впечатляют своей харизмой и как они поданы, чего только стоит Аликс Вэнс. Хотелось бы этим отзывом сделать вклад и для последующих после Half-Life 2 двух эпизодов. Эпизод один и эпизод два - это достойное продолжение и как полноценные две игры. Можно даже сказать одна полноценная игра из трех частей (эпизод три приди, эпизод три приди, эпизод три приди). На все времена, к прохождению обязательно и абсолютно не важно олдфаг ты или нет (хотя все олдфаги давно ее прошли).… ",

Ну я и прошел, ожидания конечно были велики но в принципе игра неплохая, она не идеальна но хороша. Для 2004 ого года наверное графика халвы была революционной и сам движок с физикой. НО проблема в том что это история о палке с двумя концами. Типа физика дает возможность по сэндбоксить с предметами но иногда она так дико багуется или нефизично себя ведет что хочется блевать. Стрельба в этой игре приятна, когда хуячишь гоошников с дробовика, когда с расстояния стреляешь с магнума, это доставляет дикое удовольствие. Мне во второй халве больше нравится сеттинг, порабощенная инопланетными существами земля, тоталитарный режим, что может быть лучше? Дизайн гоошников просто замечательный, идеальный сеттинг. Но проблема в том что лор уебищный, джимен рандомный чел, концовку в эпизодах слили, полная дичь. Геймплей заебывающий, идешь и идешь идешь и идешь, спасибо хоть то что иногда есть разнообразие в плане всяких \"сложных\" головоломок и покатушек. Первая часть намного лучше. Теперь речь пойдет о эпизодах. Не знаю почему но эпизоды ощущаются пободрее, скорее всего из-за того что там чуток поменяли движок и она ощущается по другому, графика кстати тоже поменялась. Но там больше разнообразия в плане геймплея. Поэтому эпизоды намного лучше оригинала. Но концовку реально слили, взяли рандомных личинок наспавнили и низахуя убили дедушку, идите нахуй.… ",

The gray world in which pressure is literally felt. Although I personally did not have enough contrast. Any scene where all the protagonist and his friends get together and just chat or something. 4) Good Russian localization. Professional voice without stupid mistakes. Disadvantages: 1) Unfortunately, I did not play the first Half-Life and therefore I cannot soberly and correctly evaluate the plot of this game. I didn’t play because I didn’t want it, but because of the devilish attitude of Valve to my fan base. Nevertheless, he seemed to me very bland and boring. A bad uncle installs totalitarianism in the city and another good uncle decided to stop him. Straight plot for the new film \"The Expendables.\" 2) Characters. They are all very cliché. Faddish professor, brave, fighting girlfriend, cowardly traitor and faithful, but an old \"soldier.\" Where is originality, where are great ideas? 3) The physics of shooting seemed to me unconvincing. I understand that the authors wanted to depict the future and the corresponding weapons, but the practice of shooting from the “stick” I went through in Call of Duty. 4) AI, in my opinion, is also a sore subject for this game. They do not try to bypass you, but simply go right through, taking quantity, not quality. 5) The gameplay is monotonous and boring. The authors tried to diversify it with various puzzles, but I think it did not help. 6) For me personally, the variety of weapons seemed very small. I understand that this is not Battlefield, but nevertheless, this is a shooter, whose main goal is shooting. Therefore, I would like the assortment of tools for this purpose to be larger. 7) It is a pity that the game is completely absent variability passing. Perhaps this is a niggle, since the game is quite old, but I would like to be able to go through missions in different ways, and not just running and going through.… ",

The biggest thing they neutered was the story and gameplay, let\u0027s go over the story first. HL2 and HL1 cannot and I repeat, cannot exist in the same universe, there is a very major plothole that makes for these 2 games to be impossible to exist in the same universe. In a script for HL1, the G-man was referred to as \"The Administrator\" and was very heavily implied to be running Black Mesa throughout your encounters with him. But in HL2, Dr. Breen is actually the administrator of Black Mesa. Another thing is that none of the characters in HL2 have been in Black Mesa, as the NPCs in HL1 are completely nameless, and judging off skin color alone to think \"Oh this guy\u0027s Kleiner\" or \"This guy\u0027s Eli\" isn\u0027t a very good argument. it is also never explained how the Combine invaded the earth, and what happened during that time. This is never explained in game. But what if I told you it would have been explained completely in detail, and it would have made sense within the HL canon? The HL2 cut beta featured a completely different storyline, with no Dr Breen, and no retcons of any kind, it is unknown as to why Valve scrapped the entire thing, considering they were really late into development with it, the actual retail HL2 took 6-8 months to make max. The gameplay has been reduced to a hallway simulator, with wimpy weapons and brain dead enemies. Another thing they added which nobody asked for is physics based combat, it really does not play to the game\u0027s advantage, as it doesn\u0027t have the raw strength and sound to give off the feel that you\u0027re all powerful, a small wooden door and a big ass metal crate make the exact same sound, and all weigh the same, it doesn\u0027t even matter, they all deal the same damage. The gravity gun is fun for the first time until you realize it instakills nearly all enemies with a single throw and it completely negates all difficulty you could have. Now onto an even bigger fault with the story, Alyx Vance is the most overpowered Mary Sue character in video game history, she always gets out unscathed, always overcomes anything in her path with no struggle, and she can never die. Even Kleiner was supposed to die in the original plot, but I guess you can\u0027t have death in a Half-Life game, oh wait. Overall, what this all boils down to is a lackluster attempt at milking more money from a franchise with a promising start.… ",

The mission structure is boring, with repetitive combat with uninteresting enemies that lack variety. Certain sections seem thrown in just to show off the engine, without considering why it\u0027s even necessary. Physics puzzles may have been interesting back when it launched but even then I found it boring and insulting to the player. More often than not they\u0027re incredibly simple and is just busywork/filler to pad out the levels. However, it is still fun to run through its expansions, which refined a lot of the game\u0027s mechanics and feel more polished as a result. The story itself is honestly pretty bland, and never reaches the highs of the original. The characters occasionally feel flat and as a result feel more like necessities to drive the game, but overall the writing is pretty good. It Still lacks a compelling reason to keep invested. It\u0027s linear structure is not helped by otherwise boring level design, perhaps due to the limits of the combat system. A pity then, as some of the weapons and tools are legitimately quite fun and unique, and provide interesting ways to interact with the environment and enemies. Ravenholm is still a highlight where the tools and level design feel consistently fun. Play it in short bursts and the combat is pretty fun. However, after certain events in the game, you\u0027re forced to face gauntlet after gauntlet of combine enemies. This is easily the most unrewarding part of the game, forcing you to battle wave after wave of enemies that rarely change their tactics and with the level design failing to bring any interesting twists to the combat. Thankfully it\u0027s usually on sale pretty cheap on steam, and fairly regularly (with its expansions). It\u0027s still wonderful to watch people speedrun it and it\u0027s worth playing through, at least once. i would advise any modern gamer to play it more as a way to see how gaming evolved, rather than using it as a standard for games to compare to. Many games have learnt and built upon the changes made in this game. I do give it points for running wonderfully on many modern systems. I have now played it across 4 operating systems and it has run well across multiple brands of graphics cards. Graphics mean little to me in terms of gameplay but from an objective standpoint it has aged well, unlike many 3D games from the early 2000s. It won\u0027t blow anything away now, but it does look serviceable and much better than many games from its era. Sound design is good, but not memorable. Serviceable perhaps. It does have a wealth of fan made mods but that does not affect my score, as Valve did not create them. I guess Valve made a great game for its time, but for its time only. While other games have gone on to play well long after they have been released, Half Life 2 stands as a dated classic. If you want to play a game from this era that plays just as well as the first time it was released, I would recommend FEAR. It\u0027s almost the complete opposite. Storytelling is far better, with immersion done far better. It has aged worse, has numerous compatibility issues, and requires extensive tweaking to get working on modern operating systems. but it\u0027s fun to play, even today. Another example would be Max Payne 2. It has aged awfully, but remains fun to this day. But play half life 2. At least once. You\u0027d be missing out otherwise.… ",

Что ж, игра пройдена в 15 раз, и вот что я скажу. В моём понимании, таким и должен быть идеальный шутер. Это чистый концентрированный динамичный геймплей, без каких-либо лишних примесей, таких как прокачка, крафт или исследование большого пустого мира (бич почти всех сегодняшних игр), но и не страдающий болячками шутеров начала и середины нулевых - монотонным коридорным шутингом и растягиванием геймплея засчёт поиска карточек к дверям, нет, халва уникальна в своём роде, я бы даже не сказал, что она опередила своё время (хотя и это само собой верно), она просто стоит особняком от всех остальных шутеров, так продолжается и по сей день. Какой ещё шутер, даже сейчас, на момент 2020 года, позволяет себе подкидывать новые механики игроку каждый час? Какой ещё шутер позволяет себе такое разнообразие в геймплее? Игрок исследует город без оружия, затем участвует в побеге на водном катере, проходит через survival-horror в ревенхолме, передвигается в полуоткрытом мире, открытом для опционального исследования, на транспорте (привет Uncharted 4), получает в своё коммандование стаю муравьиных львов, а позднее ботов-людей, для участия в кровопролитных и масштабных уличных боях на манер лучших частей Call of duty, и в финале получает совершенно уникальный опыт, когда у него забирают всё оружие, оставляя только с улучшенной гравипушкой. Какой ещё шутер содержит в себе такую физику и интерактивность с окружением? Во второй халве закончившиеся патроны никогда не являются проблемой, ведь в вашем арсенале гравипушка, поволяющая швырять любые окружающие вас предметы, мелких врагов, отбрасывать гранаты, устраивать ловушки и многое другое, на что только хватит вашей фантазии. Эта игры - пик развития сюжетных шутеров, да и наверное всей индустрии в целом. Очень жаль, что в какой-то момент геймдев свернул не туда, разработчики заболели агрессивной монетизацией, играми-сервисами, гигантоманией, и теперь в угоду более открытых пустых пространств с вышками, урезаются многие геймплейные элементы, в том числе физика, которая даже если и есть, никакого практического значения для геймплея не имеет. Но так как реализовывать наполненные и действительно интересные открытые миры умеют единицы, как, например, рокстар, мы и имеем ситуацию, при которой единственные шутеры для одиночной игры сегодня - это отвратительные фар край: нью даун, вольфенштейн: янгблад и рейдж 2. Мда уж, печально и грустно это всё. Ставлю второй халве максимальную оценку, в память о славных временах: 10 из 10.… ",

The original Half-Life was a disappointing for me, it was frustrating on it\u0027s difficulty balance, combat and annoying platforming sections, those are almost non existent here and thankfully Valve solve all those issues and make a way better Half-Life experience. Although i cannot say that Half-Life 2 is the perfect game or the best game ever made, it has its flaws, like any other game, the game includes a new mechanic that involves driving mechanics to travel long distances... the driving is pretty terrible (sorry). The voice acting is average, not bad but not great either, there are some character with a pretty calm voices over the situations occurring in the campaign, friendly squad AI is not that great, enemies like the zombies, head crabs or whatever they are called, and some little robots that fly with blades are pretty annoying and those enemies are way to often to encounter. One of the biggest improvements was the physics, that are useful to move over other section and they respond fluently, over the failed attempt from the first game. Facial animation is really impressive for a game released back in 2004, character felt... real!!! and not like lifeless mannequins. Still... i cannot deny the Half -Life 2 is a great and impressive game, that everyone should play, specially now that they are for free on STEAM (well... free to play for a limited time). But again, everyone should play it.… ",

There are so many modifications for Half Life 2 popping up, most of them are free too! This game should be owned by every Half-Life fan in my oppinion. There are many many games where you have to wait a long time for things to load, but it\u0027s your computer that makes it so slow. Just get an upgrade as you probably need one to experience the game in its full beauty.… ",

Gordon\u0027s low capacity of ammo serves a nice challenge, since the weapons tear through bullets faster than a squirrel through trees. The ending was a bit of a let down, though.",

VALVe offers you one of the most diverse gameplay: each chapter has its own mechanics and new weapons, real NEW weapons: they\u0027re not just more powerful, they\u0027re really different (as the gravity gun). The story is great and very immersing: you know who you are, what you must do and why you do it... It isn\u0027t like: \"Hey! that\u0027s the story! keep doing whatever you were doing! (mindless killing in most cases)\". The AI isn\u0027t great, that\u0027s agreed, but it\u0027s somehow acceptable because it\u0027s not at the center of the game. The graphics are getting old too but it\u0027s very well done (I still play the first Half-Life: it doesn\u0027t matter) and the physics are still great, actually it\u0027s really the only game where you have a real interactivity with the physics.… ",
