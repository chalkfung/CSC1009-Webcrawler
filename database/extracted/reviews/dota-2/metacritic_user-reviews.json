I know some people who play LOL might bash in this game, but both games are compleatly different. Its like comparing COD and Battlefield, they are so different that connot be compared. (no preference on either game, I think bot of them are good) Give this game a try, the learning curve is very steep but it is rewarding when you learn. I think this is the best gave valve has ever developed and has been the most played game on steam ever since the second year of beta development. Try it out, its free and badass!… ",

I wouldn\u0027t recommend it if you\u0027re a casual gamer and can\u0027t be bothered to invest that time. If that\u0027s the case and you want to play a MOBA then that\u0027s where LoL comes in. If you already play LoL and want something more challenging and more rewarding then by all means try Dota 2. Plus it has way better graphics, great character customization and doesn\u0027t require any money to unlock heroes (which I find very frustrating in LoL). It is also more balanced imo. As for the community, well it\u0027s still a MOBA so don\u0027t expect too much, although it\u0027s not so bad.… ",

I have played LoL, DOTA, DOTA 2 and some lesser known MOBAs and DOTA 2 is by far the best. In addition, it is F2P which is amazing. And unlike, LoL or HoN which require you to use a rotating hero list until you buy your own with real money or accumulate enough in-game currency to purchase a single hero, DOTA 2 immediately gives you access to its entire library of heroes, for free. In LoL as of the date of this post, it would cost $588 to unlock all heroes with real money. (15000RP/$100, total cost heroes 88185 RP. This calculation excludes bundles) Each character has a unique playstyle and skillset, and doesn\u0027t feel like a clone of another character or a cheap rip off. Every character plays a certain role well, and plays it uniquely. Playing well leads to great rewards, and playing poorly has severe consequences. There are issues with DOTA 2, the biggest being there is a huge learning curve and you are going to start out being bad if you don\u0027t have previous DOTA experience. Learning characters skills, what items do, and what you should be doing early mid and late game initially may be overwhelming. However, doing research and practicing eventually pay off as DOTA 2 is truly one of the most challenging and highest skill cap games available. Valve is also implementing (or has implemented) a tutorial, but there is no way the sheer amount of information needed is contained within it. But I\u0027m sure its a great place to start. Graphics are great. Gameplay is great. Servers seem lag free. Crashes are very rare. ITS FREE!… ",

So let me bring this up as a Dota2 ex DotA and HoN and LoL player. If you\u0027re transitioning from league of legends, you don\u0027t have to worry about runes or stuff like that, since any imbalance caused by that is no trouble to us, secondly, you have ALL the heroes/champions. You can experiment without playing x amount of games for a 6300 IP champion, and doing that about 50 times but you have to keep in mind that DotA has more advanced mechanics and is more punishing. If you are saying that this games changes you, it\u0027s not the game that changes you, it\u0027s yourself letting changed by the nature of the game, you become more competitive and forgetting that you are playing with other players. While I do admit DotA has some minor issues as to the matchmaking system but it\u0027s not extremely easy to asses each player\u0027s skill and their improvement, it\u0027s never been done by machines with 100% success we have to be patient. F And lastly, please do not talk about the game if you didn\u0027t play it extensively and competitively, since some reviews say that vote of surrender IS a feature in dota 2 (it\u0027s not). Don\u0027t follow the ragers that critic everything just for the sake of being cynical. All in all this is a REALLY strong game with each hero being unique and strong in itself but keep in mind the advanced mechanics, and if you are new, try practicing with bots, they are pretty okay to start, read guides, don\u0027t assume you\u0027re the all knowing guy and see you in the game.… ",

    "comments": "I played my first game of DotA about 6-7 years ago,and I must say I immediately fell in love with it.I played it a lot and after some time I started playing other games of same genre (League of Legends mostly).I have to confess that i was happy playing LoL and wasn\u0027t hyped at all when Dota 2 was announced, I thought it was another try to get money by copying DotA.I was very wrong,Dota 2 isI played my first game of DotA about 6-7 years ago,and I must say I immediately fell in love with it.I played it a lot and after some time I started playing other games of same genre (League of Legends mostly).I have to confess that i was happy playing LoL and wasn\u0027t hyped at all when Dota 2 was announced, I thought it was another try to get money by copying DotA.I was very wrong,Dota 2 is the most balanced,fun and strategically complex game I played so far. Game is focused on gameplay but graphics are very decent.If you are coming from other games of this genre, it may take some time getting used to graphics.For those thinking that graphics are dark and wondering why,there is very good explanation.Terrain is dark so there is greater contrast between terrain and abillity particles(usually bright) so teamfights are more clear.Steam Workshop did a very good job making cosmetics for heroes, making heroes look even better. As for gameplay its a true skill based game.There are no bonuses you get by spending money and all heroes are playable from start.Game balance is almost perfect(Out of 96 available heroes on tournaments 96 are played at least once in last month).The most amazing thing about Dota 2 is amount of strategies you can play, synergies between heroes, lane combos you can play with friends.Even when you think that everything is hopeless and want to give up, with good timing and team coordiantion you can turn around every game(that is why there is no surrender option in Dota 2). The best side of game is it\u0027s complexity and in same time it is the worst.There are lot of mechanics that are very important and that you have to know to be a decent player, but once you learn them you will find them very clever and fun.All heroes have strong ability kits and are fun to play.Heroes are very different with very different playstyle, even playing against some hereos require different playstyle.Some heroes are easier to play then others so you may find them stronger at beginning but as you advance as player and learn how to deal with them you will realise they are not that good.Although game is updated every week, there are only couple of balance patches a year.Many people dislike fact that there are 4-5 new heroes added each year, but development team philosophy is to add heroes not for the sake of adding, but to improve the game. As for community I must say its very complex.Some people will rage at you, blame you, even troll you.I think that is kinda expected from online F2P game, but as you play more games you will get bigger MMR(match make rating) and you will rarely see this kind of people.Since there is report system most of ragers and trolls are banned/muted.Many people will complain about community, but in reality community is much more mature and friendly then in other F2P multiplayer games. DotA/Dota 2 as an Esport is a game played at almost every Esport event.In my opinion its in Top 3 Esport(others are Starcraft and Counter-Strike) of all time.Biggest tournament is The International which gathers best teams of the world to compete for 2-3 million dollars prize pool.Dota 2 scene is constantly growing, and it is a game that is very fun to watch (You can even bet with Cosmetic items on some sites making watching games even more fun).Games are watchable through in-game Dota 2 TV that is most amazing spectator client i have ever seen.You can watch games through player\u0027s perspective that alows you to see every action of player you are watching (His Cursor ,Screen...),listen to your favorite commentators and there is option to see different type of graphs and statistics available. It is highly recommended to play tutorial before playing against other players.Since at beginning you are matched with players who also created new account your first 10-20 games might be against DotA veteran or complete noobs,but it will get better after those ten game.Bad games can happen to everyone(even professional players have bad games from time to time), so If you play bad in some game and feed just say you are sorry and 99% of time team won\u0027t flame you.Watching guids helps a lot aswell (Purge and Merlini Recomended).There are even mini-guides created by community you can find ingame in top-left corner.Playing this kind of game with friends is much better.By the way if you don\u0027t know Russian you will learn a great deal of it (trust me :D). At the end Dota 2 is not the game you will play and master in couple of hours.Skillcap is enormous and even professional players can\u0027t play all heroes very well.Every game of Dota 2 is a new lesson that will improve you as a player.If you are looking for game to play without spending much time learing it ,this is not the game you are looking for. Note:Some reviews will bash this game,players and mechanics although they never played it before.Its mostly because of rivalry betwen Dota 2 and LoL.… ",

When I was a kid, I used to play a bunch of gamesMy all time favorite game. Every year new game releases turn up in a cartwheel of hype, everyone buys them like no tomorrow or maybe not, but they do sell regardless. If you look back, you\u0027ve probably amassed a lot of games, completed a ton of those, but can you still name them all? Do you still play them? Were they worth the price tag? When I was a kid, I used to play a bunch of games like Populous, Dungeon Keeper, Theme Hospital, Beasts \u0026 Bumpkins, Age of Empires, Roller Coaster Tycoon, Brood War, Command and Conquer: Red Alert, Heroes of Might and Magic III and a bunch of other games of the time. While I enjoyed them a lot, I eventually didn\u0027t get any kind of fresh feeling out of those. While I enjoyed them while they were new and some a bit longer than that, they sooner or later ran out of content. Playing the same things over and over again turned tedious. Newer games, say, Diablo III, gave me about 2 weeks worth of stuff (chest simulation) to do. Hype was massive, reviews were optimistic, but games nowadays tend to be released like that. They have eye candy, but they\u0027re really hollow in the end. I never returned to that game. I never returned to Guild Wars 2. I will never play Bioshock Infinite again. Won\u0027t be playing Darksiders II, won\u0027t be playing Fallout 3. Won\u0027t be playing Oblivion or Mass Effect. Now this game, it merely got a facelift, hence the number 2, in case you have never played the original user made map inside Warcraft III. I\u0027ve however stuck with it for 7-8 years now and I am not tired of it. I am not tired of it because I haven\u0027t got a set final goal or task. That\u0027s something most games have. They have a plot, chapters, maps or stages and when you\u0027re done with them, it is over. I was slightly hesitant to give a perfect 10, because that means perfection to me, but in all honesty, I have never played anything that has even come close to bringing as much joy, ordeal, satisfaction and gratification as this game, so I am going to give it that score. It has the right to get it from me. I got into the beta around October 2011. I have over 4000 hours played. Some has been just chatting, watching games and such, but I am nearing 3000 matches played regardless. I don\u0027t think a poor game can make anyone stick with it for that long. No mods yet besides some useless audio mods as jokes, but nothing that could keep you playing other games a bit longer. Just the original content. I don\u0027t even think the community is such a pain in the ass. At least 95% of all the people in the world are snap judgmental that aren\u0027t afraid to step on you if they get any kind of benefit or gratification out of it, but that fact alone doesn\u0027t seem to make people want to quit life. It\u0027s a team game, thus you probably should have a team or any group of players to play this with, if you are sensitive to the opinions of strangers. It\u0027s a game that doesn\u0027t fit a casual gamer, the kind of person who plays Angry Birds, Bejeweled or some other time sink of the kind, but it is a fantastic game for people who really are vehemently into games, the kind of niche group that played games before they entered a market of people who need their hands held. I think reviewing games of this nature is a bit hard at the moment, because it\u0027s being compared to things where you can choose how easy you want the game to be on you. I think grading Dota is like grading ice hockey. To play, you actually need to know how to use skates, how, when and where to shoot, what doesn\u0027t work and such. If you have no talent or are in no shape or form and can\u0027t be bothered to gain any of that with sheer will, you\u0027re not going to progress. You can\u0027t progress by hitting OK, as the game is testing you and your abilities. Even bad players can enjoy it regardless. They just need to accept the fact that games of this kind won\u0027t unravel spontaneously before them. The game itself plays a minimal part as your margin for error is at least as big as the skill of your opponent is. The fact that losing and winning is completely up to human co-operation and wits is something that keeps me playing. Casual games can be fun for a while, but they lack something that is essential for longevity and that is intense competition, complex tactics and a desire for knowledge. I might be up for a match of Mario Party with some beer, but I wouldn\u0027t do that for months every day or every second day. Maybe the beer, but easy and simple things just get stale fast, as they don\u0027t stimulate your brain when they become clear. I\u0027ll gladly discuss this game with my friends with a pint, reminisce our big plays, horrible feeding games, make fun of each other for our horrible stats in some games, flaunt how we completely demolished some pro or some total we\u0027ve all played with, think of good drafts, which pros are huge noobs and so on. Other games are just games to me. I am not into speed running or to any stuff of that sort, so they\u0027re just one-night stands to me. To me Dota is a hobby.… ",

This free-to-play game will provide you hundreds and possibly thousands of hours of pure multiplayer bliss. Dota is a very complex game with an enormous learning curve, and you will need to dedicate your time and your attention to this game if you want to be good at it. Thankfully Valve has made really neat tutorial levels that will introduce you to the game. There are also dozens of guides online that will help you. The goal of the game is simple: destroy the enemy\u0027s main building: the Ancient. There are two sides competing. The Dire and The Radiant. Each side contains five players. Upon entering a matchmade game you will be placed on the either side. After that you will pick prompted to pick your hero, amongst a selection of literally 100+. You will then buy your starting items and head down the lane (called \"mid, \"bottom\" or \"top\") that you choose. You will then look to kill enemy \"creeps\", which are AI-controled monsters that periodically spawn from the base and head down each lane, and enemy heroes. Gradually you should look to destroy enemies\u0027 towers, after you have become more powerful. After you have destroyed the enemies\u0027 towers and their barracks, their Ancient will be exposed to attacks and you will be a able to destroy it. Dota contains almost limtless amount of ways you can play. The heroes, the roles they fill, the items, they are all so different, you are guaranteed to not get bored. From heroes that support their team like Crystal Maiden, to heroes who \"carry\" their team like Phantom Lancer, across assassins like Bounty Hunter, \"pushers\" like Nature\u0027s Prophet Dota will provide you a different experience every single match you play. As a free to play title it contains absolutely no ways for paying customers to have advantage over non-paying ones. All heroes will be available to you when you start playing. There are simply no buy-to-win elements in the game. What paying customers buy is cosmetic items, whose purpose is just to look pretty. This means you can choose from a collection of different sets of items to customize the way your favorite hero looks, and you can also buy different looks for your HUD and different voices for your annoucner. Did I mention this cosmetic items are available without paying money too? When you play a match of Dota, you are awarded experience and when you have enough experience you will level up, and as your reward you will get a cosmetic item. You can also trade your cosmetic items with other players, in case they have something you like. The amount of detail Valve has put in this game is astounishing. Every hero has their own theme, their story. The heroes are funny and always have an interesting line to say. Every hero has their own unique character. There are even rival heroes for example Lina and Crystal Maiden, two twin sisters, one who specializes in fire and other in ice. If they are playing against one another or are in the same team, they will say different lines to each other. Another example is Zeus who is a literal God, and will constantly make fun out the puny mortals he is pittied against. Anti-Mage, little to no surprise, has a quest to destroy all magic and will constistantly loathe magic users throught the game. Games are unpredictable. One team may be in the lead one moment, and then lose their advantage the next moment. This game punishes you harshly for making mistakes and rewards you greatly for making the right decision. Teamwork is the key to victory. You will need to communicate with your team and make plans together if you want to win. The communtiy of this game is not the best, but it is to be expected of a free-to-play game available to everyone. You WILL run across players who will be angry at you one way or the other, and will maybe throw harsh words your way. My advice is just to report them (open up the scoreboard, click then name and then report) and move on. As you gain in skill you will gain in your victories, and when you gain victories you will be put to play against better people. The higher you go in MMR (which is the system game uses to determine your skill) the nicer people will become. You should definately this game a try, after all it is free to do so. But trust me, you will get hooked on this game and it will certianly take away a large portion of your time.… ",

Short queue timeThe game itself is fantastic and should receive a score of 9/10 or even 10/10. On the other hand, there are several other aspects that are highly detrimental to the overall experience. - Broken matchmaking system. You can queue a long time (5-10 minutes after a couple of declines/failed loading/game dodging) and you are rewarded a match that is completely imbalanced. Short queue time should mean more balanced matchmaking, but you\u0027d be hard pressed to see the difference. Enjoy the frustration levels go through the roof as you can easily play for several hours without winning a single match. Matchmaking is broken even further because of battalions of smurf accounts and matchmaking system fails to evaluate these accounts properly. After wasting 30-45 minutes of your life in a match that was impossible to win in the first place, don\u0027t think it\u0027s over yet as you will most likely get fountain camped. And there you are, basically held as a hostage in the game unless you want low priority queue because of abandoning the game. - There is no ladder nor any skill rating except for high and very high matchmaking pseudo-brackets. Makes sense, because the matchmaking works so poorly. - The player community is one of the worst out there. In EU servers despite English language selection, you will frequently get players from Eastern Europe and Russia that spam the chat with their own language. Even if there are no language problems prepare to get scapegoated, called names and reported for ridiculous reasons if someone else in your team thinks you did something wrong. - To combat armies of trolls there is a senseless reporting system with forced mutes and low priority queues. Every player has two reports available every week, and considering quality of the community, you\u0027re probably out of reports in a day or two. You get the worst of both worlds, not being able to report enough of the misbehaving players and on the other hand you can reported and punished without a valid reason. There are commendations too, but they don\u0027t mean anything. - Instead of improving the essential game content, Valve rather concentrates on making new hats. Just kidding, they don\u0027t even make the cosmetics themselves.… ",

So just go out and annoy them :). Another problem which cause me problems on Dota is some of the people playing it. There so insulting, blaming people for everything just because there loosing asking people to report you. Just ignore it have fun because most of the time there will be some nice people on the team who are just here to enjoy the game so enjoy the little things, from daring escapes to denies. because at the end of the day there going to be the one sat at there computer raging while your just enjoying this great experience valve provides.

Dota 2 is how a free to play game differentiates from all the other free to play games because it brings the community together more easily doesn\u0027t force item purchases or special content to certain players. Dota 2 will only get better from here to study characters and abilities correctly is hard enough and rewarding. This game gets a 9.2 from me with my nostril hairs seal of approval.… ",

There haven\u0027t been any abandonments and the report system is certainly working, there is far less negative behaviour then when I started a year ago. If you practice your hero, learn about them and do your job properly, then there is no reason for anyone to flame you. I have never been addicted to a game as much as Dota 2.… ",

For the most part any hero in the game is capable of defeating any other hero in the game if the two players are equally skilled. It\u0027s very balanced in that respect. It is also a fun game if you can get past the culture, attitude, arrogance, and hostility that people bring to the game. That problem is it\u0027s very hard to get past that part. This game is full of the most hateful, immature, ignorant people you will ever find in any MMO game, period. I played WoW for over a year, I played SW: TOR, I have played several random \"web-based\" games where you also expect the bottom of the barrel in terms of users and community, but every horrid online community I\u0027ve ever seen pales in comparison to this. You may think I\u0027m exaggerating, but if you can put 10-20 hours into this game without being called newb, baddie, or told to go kill yourself/uninstall, then I\u0027m envious of you. That doesn\u0027t even cover the harassment and berating you will receive from your own team no matter how new you are, or how hard you are trying. If you make a mistake prepare to pay for it in hateful comments from your own team, up to and including calling you every imaginable name over mic and in chat. The majority of players on US servers at certain times are foreign and cannot speak English, and Valve has decided to ignore this problem and believe me, it\u0027s a huge problem in a game that requires communication which only adds to the overall hate and frustration level. Russians are the biggest problem on US servers right now and if you happen to offend one of them, regardless of which team this person is on, they will almost certainly ask the other Russians in the game, again regardless of team, to report you. You have no recourse and the process is semi-automated. You will receive mutes from Valve after you accumulate enough reports the validity of which makes no difference. I have just spent two paragraphs warning you of what you are getting into, while only devoting one paragraph to the nice parts of this game. Make of that what you will, but if you do decide to play this game, I advice muting everyone before the match even begins including your own team. It\u0027s your own team that will berate and harass you with the most racist and hateful speech you can imagine much more often than the opposing team. Score-wise I gave it a 6 because I think it represents exactly what I\u0027m trying to say this game is fantastic, but the community and players are not. Half and half. I would also like to add that I am near 200 total wins, with a winning percentage around .433. I am not new nor am I offended by the overall experience, but it is indeed a negative experience as far as the community goes. I subject myself to the player interactions because I can (usually) take it in stride, mute the player, and move on. If you don\u0027t have a thick skin though, this game is not for you.… ",

The game offers full experience to every hero instead of paying to play the hero you desire. Of course, Dota 2 is enjoyable at first. After having playing the game for over 600 hours; the game contains various things I dislike. For example, the Quest tab is actually a tutorial instead of what I expected to be either a mini-campaign for all the heroes or a campaign containing back-story for the characters. But when I found that out I was simply disappointed even now. Some hero dialogues are plain lazy such as Tidehunter\u0027s lame level-up dialogues of eating sea-creatures. Furthermore, if you fail to do what a team-mate desires they will insult you; some will even ask you to simply quit playing Dota 2. Now, there is a report button but it requires multiple players to do so, but most of the time no one reports the unsporting player which this really disappointed me. Moreover, when you know you\u0027re going to lose (enemies are unstoppable, your defenses are destroyed, your items are basic, your level is low, etc) there is obviously no point in staying, unless you don\u0027t want to get reported or insulted by the bad community or get battle points and item drops (usually useless cosmetics). Beside of me \u0027bashing\u0027 this game, Dota executes well for playing with your friends in a full team or in a team match which you gain full communication. I highly recommend this as I often get a team that does not communicate well. Dota 2 should include significant changes in modes and add \u0027Fast Respawn Mode\u0027 as the mod has it and because it\u0027s longass waiting time is really frustrating. Although, I have not mentioned \u0027over-powered\u0027 heroes there is always a way to \u0027counter\u0027 them. Unless they counter you. Many may disagree with my review but this is simply my opinion of Dota 2. I am actually being kind to this game with its score (otherwise this might have been a 6 or 5) because it does keep me \u0027enjoyed\u0027 for some parts of the 600 hours I\u0027ve played ever since the early beta.… ",

And if you learn the game the right way, even the learning process is tons of fun. But if learn it the wrong way...it can be horrible due to the community. Speaking about that...if you are looking to get into DOTA2, here are a few tips that I think should make your n00b experience less painful: 1. Don\u0027t just stick to one or two heroes...in order to be a good player, you have to learn what the other heroes can do so you can better counter them. The worst thing in DOTA is to be ignorant of an opponent\u0027s abilities and then do something silly like run around when Bloodseeker ruptures you and wonder why you died. You only get this experience from trying out each hero. 2. On that note...until you are very confident, NEVER pick a hero you haven\u0027t played before in a multiplayer game. Always try out new heroes in bot games so you can get comfortable with how they play. 3. Most importantly, realize that DOTA is honestly more like a team sport than a game. It is competitive, and if you don\u0027t take it seriously, you will ruin the experience for your team-mates. I know it\u0027s frustrating when people yell at you, and sometimes they honestly are just wrong and being jerks...but be considerate and realize that if you go in unprepared you are basically being a jerk too. I mean, would you play goalie in a competitive game of soccer without ever practicing or even knowing what the goalie is supposed to do? No...so take the same philosophy with DOTA 2...dont\u0027 play a hero or a position/role when you are completely ignorant of how it is supposed to function. Just put in the time to do a bit of research and practice and you will have a much better experience! Happy gaming!… ",

It\u0027s a $10 virtual book which allows you to really follow and interact with the tournament as it progresses. You\u0027ll be able to make predictions about all kinds of game stats and winners, stamp your book with collectible player cards which you can collect from playing the game, create a fantasy team and earn points based on their performance throughout the tournament, and also vote on who you want to see play in the 1v1 and all-star matches using your compendium. But possibly the best thing about the compendium is that 75% of your $10 purchase will go directly to the tournament\u0027s prizepool. What started out as a $1.6 million prize pool has almost reached $2.6 million through the community\u0027s purchasing of compendiums. And along the way, Valve has rewarded compendium purchasers for reaching 5 of the prizepool milestones by them unique skins and items which themselves are worth the $10 purchase (Any future compendium buyers even get all the previous rewards as well so they won\u0027t be missing out). Even the 1v1 tournament portion portion of the event wasn\u0027t originally planned, but is now being held as a reward for the compendium reaching its 5th milestone. By getting into Dota 2, you\u0027re not just learning to play a game, you\u0027re learning to play an e-sport. It\u0027s a game you\u0027ll have countless hours of fun playing, but also a game you can watch and follow even when you don\u0027t feel like playing. And watching Dota 2 can be just as captivating as playing it, because there can be so many amazing and exciting things that can happen.… ",

Korea w/ Starcraft. I really believe this. Valve has done a simply amazing job of bringing the game over into its own while retaining the character and solid mechanics of its WC3 counterpart. It\u0027s a highly challenging game that will immerse you for hours, the support of the pro scene is phenomenal, and the little holiday events that Valve puts on just ads to the charm of the game. The characters are well developed and feel unique not only in their gameplay styles, but also in their personalities. They do not feel static, but feel very alive, just like an RPG should. It\u0027s the perfect blend. If you\u0027re into games that are addicting, have high skill caps, e-sports, team play, and community, then definitely try DotA. The community CAN be a little brutal sometimes, but once you find some good, mature, and patient friends to play with, that\u0027s when this game really shines. Their matchmaking system would be my only complaint. They are still sorting it and are actively looking at ways to improve it, but it\u0027s really put a damper on the game since its launch. The temporary issues with MM aside, this game is an absolute masterpiece. What could you expect from Valve though? These guys are the new Blizzard.… ",

For those who know how to play, have a balanced match with other players of similar skill or even more experienced is very rewarding and fun, it feel like to play a real game of football, basketball or any other sport under the same conditions. But not everything is perfect. For beginners is one of the hardest games to learn and master. All choices are important, since the hero to your items or even your \"line\" matter. And to make the right choices you need to understand and consider what qualities, disadvantages and various other aspects when choosing... and the only way to learn is by trying, struggling, being blamed for the defeats and various other things. If you take learning with humor you\u0027ll probably have a good laughs, but if you do not have a lot of patience to learn and not have anyone to help you, I advise you to skip this game and avoid stress. The main reason why I can not give 10/10 is the process of training that should be much improved as well as some other aspects such as match-making. Finally, like any new game Dota 2 have their faults that can be corrected over time, but that surely does not affect the main purpose of the game, which is fun, challenging and competitive, something that the game achieves very effectively, hence... 9/10 for Dota 2.… ",

Dota 2 is considered to this day \"THE\" MOBA game and it\u0027s impossible to deny that a lot of veterans and old gamers of the old version haveI\u0027ve never been a big MOBA player and I really, REALLY suck at RTS games or any game that requires real time strategy: this point shows an opinion from an outsider, and not a veteran, as I just randomly got into this game and played for over 100 hours. Dota 2 is considered to this day \"THE\" MOBA game and it\u0027s impossible to deny that a lot of veterans and old gamers of the old version have both gripes and angers upon this game for changes and whatever: like I said, I\u0027ll just say what I think as a random gamer. And that is, this game is excellent...for a free to play game. For starters, the game already lets you use EVERY hero in the roster from the start with NO money required to buy other avatars: that is a HUGE pro because, as many know, in other f2p MOBA games (like LoL) you need to buy with real money the other heroes (or be extremely patient), or else you\u0027ll be stuck with a few bunches every week that changes sporadically. This also means that the only thing you can buy are costumes and keys for crates, which unlock other costumes or parts...just like tf2 (afterall it\u0027s also a game of Valve). But that\u0027s it actually: the game asks nothing else from us and the fact that you HAVE all the heroes at once means a HUGE longevity from the start: every hero is unique in their skillsets and have an unique design that are kinda fascinating (sure, there are exceptions, but if I had to make examples, it would take all day); the statuses and the levelling upgrades are very well programmed, since that you only need to check out for 6 stats :Attack, defense, speed and the 3 main stats, which are strength, agility and intelligence; these last stats are also how the heroes are splitted, which basically means that the items you will need are gonna be more or less effective, depending on your main attribute, which will increase BOTH your damage AND whatever the stat grants: for example strength increase hp, agility increases armor and attack speed, and intelligence gives you more mana and mana regenration. With the items splitted into 3 stats plus other statuses (and with also items that give unique abilities and many active items), you can see that, on paper, the game is very big and \"complete\" from the get go. Of course though, with a big roster of heroes, we also have a lot of issues with balancing: heroes are splitted into various roles that can do also multiple roles, and these roles also define their main focus on the match and how they must be played That it\u0027s actually well done...for the most part. Sure, some heroes WILL be more powerful than others and WILL need a lot of effort to take down, but at the same time you\u0027ll see their weaknesses from the instant you\u0027ll try to fight them, showing a balance...to a certain degree, since some heroes are extremely powerful that, while not being overpowered, they CAN be the ruination of the match. In the end, also, it\u0027s also up to the player, since every character have a weakness that must be exploited to take them down (Stealth based heroes, for instance, require a dust to take them down or you won\u0027t be able to spot them anymore). Enough of good points...what\u0027s rotten instead? There are various issues in the game like the difficulty that REALLY requires a lot of training in practice mode but, if I have to pick one in particular, it\u0027s gonna be... The community. This isn\u0027t the worst community ever...but sure is annoying! Don\u0027t take me wrong though, EVERY SINGLE ONLINE GAME has at least a part of community that can\u0027t stop annoy other people, so I can\u0027t really say it\u0027s the biggest problem of the game (or else every mmo or online game in existence would have a zero just because of the community). But yes, the community can be a problem: in many matches I\u0027ve played, there was, AT BEST, one leaver from one of the teams...if not 2 or more: that means that if a player leaves, that match is gonna be a loss or a tough fight, because there\u0027s NO substitution of players; I heard they were planning some sort of player switching and I do hope so because I\u0027ve seen so many matches lost because of one \"insert insult\" decided that not getting a first blood means we fail as a team. But I\u0027ll be honest saying that, while I\u0027ve seen MANY bad players, I\u0027ve also had many good people willing to cooperate and I rarely met too many \"insert insult\" willing to ruin the mood and the game, so I consider myself lucky to have played many good matches, without mentioning some matches won with huge disadvantage (I once won 3 against 5, but also lost 5 against 2!). Other issues are probably the items in the shop, which can be expensive too...but that\u0027s entirely for looks and nothing else, so it does\u0027t count. Probably there are other minor issues but I can\u0027t much, except that Dota 2, as a MOBA game, it\u0027s very complete and deep, with no restrictions on how to start: you can start anytime, and you can pick any hero and enjoy until you want, either improving or just for relaxing. The limit is only your patience.… ",

First I would like to explain a little about me. I personally have a strong connection with strategy games and overall challenging games with fairly high learning curves, this being civilization 4 and 5, starcraft 2, league of legends, heroes of newerth and so on. So what I can say about Dota is that it is potentially the hardest of all of these to master. If you play the game and go to the hero screen, select meepo, then you know\u0027ll know how hard it can be. Getting into the game though has started to become easier then when it was in Beta though as tutorials, in-game guides, and improved layout has made it much easier to come into then before. Even if I didn\u0027t play Dota 1 I can tell you it is much, much smoother. But while their exists only a couple major tutorials I want to highlight that their will probably be more along the way. In fact, valve has set up such a progressive series of goals for Dota 2 that will make the game run even stronger. For example, the dreaded leaver situation when someone loses internet or just is angry and leaves everyone 4 v 5. I personally have this problem in League of Legends, and Smite all the time. Well eventually Valve plans on reaching the point of having a bot take control of the character. Now this is amazing to me! Too many times has someone left at critical points and I suffered defeat at the hands of this. I already applaud the fact that unlike Lol or Smite I can control the leaver but even then that can be difficult with your own hero. This just shows how much work is still on the table and where this game is still going. Dota 2 despite being released out of Beta still has another 10 or 11 heroes not yet ported from Dota 1, so more strat is still coming. Another amazing thing is Dota 2 future plans to allow modding of maps and game modes, which is something the original dota at its heart was all about. Already people can mod costumes for characters and make cool in game gear (that pays the maker, Yeah valve pays people to create cosmetics) that doesn\u0027t affect the in-game gameplay. Dota 2 is a game about balance, constantly looking to create a fair strategic game. I have problems with Lol about how skins can improve champs, which adds to the P2W argument but thats a whole different debate I\u0027m not touching. The game has come to such a point that it runs so smoothly and in a sense it has the mindset of a game of basketball. At first your not the best shot and people will get aggressive but as you become comfortable with the game you catch on quick. You can imagine the different roles like positions on a basketball team, and make comparisons to help you. There is a great deal of help not necesarilly in the game but online too. The Dota communitty is very strong, simillarly to the LoL communitty on websites like Reddit. I believe the Dota 2 reddit did a poll actually and found that they were the 6th most visited Reddit group (don\u0027t quote me on it, I could be mistaken since I can\u0027t find the post) There you can find people who are also learning and professionals who can answer your questions or help you learn. It\u0027s very interesting as well to see how much Valve pays attention to their fans, if a bug get\u0027s reported or an issue with Dota 2 Valve responds incredibly quickly. One of the things that even I thought I would never take a part of was the professional series but valve has done a great job to nudge me in. I never thought I would start enjoying watching pros play but the I didn\u0027t think the same about basketball. However with so much accessibilty it becomes easy to get excited and view just about any game with the replay system and what not. Currently Dota 2 has the largest prize pool in eSports for the International 3. The community is strong and although we may have the occasional aggresive teammate, I personally find the aggresive teammate often is someone who needs a hug cause he having a bad game. (a.k.a dieing a lot or he\u0027s not sure what to either) So in conclusion, It\u0027s honestly amazing to see how far the game has come along. However it is important to note that even now that it\u0027s out of Beta it still has a long way to go, with so much more planned ahead. Whether it be adjusting a model to give a character a better charm of likeability, or striving towards their goals the game has come along way in improving itself during Beta. However do not have the notion that it is done most of what it wants to do. It\u0027s just getting started.… ",

It can take quite a while memorize and become comfortable with all of it, but it\u0027s well worth the price. Low ranking matches can be quite frustrating with how long a rounds are. New and confused teammates will take out frustration on each other, but mid-high level players all have social skills and communicate effectively. The low level community is one of the worst I have seen in a game, yet the high level community is one of the best. Overall I think the game\u0027s complexity, and balance results in one of the best online multiplayer experiences you can get, but Free 2 Play isn\u0027t actually free as it will require a substantial time investment. It\u0027s a brilliant and polished game on so many levels, but until Valve develops a more effective teaching method I don\u0027t think it deserves a 10.… ",

I wish there was a 9.5). I\u0027ve dedicated over 1400 hours to this game, and probably more in it\u0027s original incarnation of DotA back on the Warcraft 3 engine. NOTE: I will list all the technical aspects first, then go through the bad and mixed after that, and the reasons I absolutely rate this game a 10 will be listed after. First off, the game itself is solid. It is mechanically and competitively balanced. There may be certain heroes that are currently favored in both high level public matches and in professional matches, but statistics show that win rates are pretty balanced at the 50% mark. Secondly, the aesthetics and graphics are pretty well done. It is clearly a step above the original DotA. However, design style in comparison to other DotA clones are strictly to a user\u0027s preference. I know people who love LoL\u0027s design over Dota2\u0027s and vice versa. The caveat is that these things SHOULD NOT matter. It might get some getting use to, but overall, it will not detract from the experience. Thirdly, the (may be) bad. This is true for every ARTS (or MOBA) game out there. There WILL be rude players out there. This is a game where every game counts. Since each match lasts for about 30 minutes to an hour each, a lot of people will only be able to play 1 to 2 games at a time. As such, they are emotionally invested to get the best experience of playing the game every time. Being so will encourage players to be extremely passionate about each match, so when there exists a player who is clearly not up to snuff, a visceral raging will most likely ensue. This leads me up to the next point: Fourthly, the mix: This is not a game you can play just play casually forever. This game has a learning curve for EVERY aspect of the game, i.e. heroes, item builds, map control, laning, jungle control, warding, etc. You will SUCK at the beginning. It is inevitable. Everyone who starts this game has to go through it. This is the source of what many people call \"Egoism\" among veteran players. All of us veterans had to go through periods of mediocrity to be where we are now. We invested hours and hours into not just playing the game, but reading about it outside the game. This means we did homework on reading hero guides, watching replays, looking for tips on ward positions, etc. We went through sort of a \"rite of initiation\" to attain the personal skill level we are at now. In order for ANYONE to play this game WELL, they\u0027d have to go through the same process over time. However, you will not go through this process alone which is illustrated in the next point. Fifthly, the good: The community as a whole is one of the BEST i\u0027ve ever been a part of. This may seem weird after I listed the third point. However, aside from the vicious minority, I\u0027ve largely felt that this is the multiplayer game with the least amount of \"a**holes\". I\u0027ve also found that the people who regularly complained about the \"horrible\" community are also the ones who regularly berates others in game. A bad attitude always begets bad attitude from others. However, this is one community that also LOVES to help new players succeed. People regularly posts guides and videos to help new players out. You just have to search for them. There are alot of resources to be gain from youtube as well. And friends i have that had just started out regularly tells me about their experiences where their teammates and even their opponents would give them tips to perform better each time. It is always best to upfront about your level of expertise, especially if you\u0027re new. This will set your teammates expectations at the appropriate level from the beginning and they\u0027d be able to help you out when you need it. I\u0027ve even seen people offer to train new players. Sixth, The game itself has one of the most deepest design I have ever experienced in a game. You know that feeling that after 100 games of COD multiplayer, you\u0027d feel like there\u0027s nothing new anymore? I\u0027ve played this game (Dota2 and DotA) for 8 years and I\u0027m still learning something new and subtle everyday. What sets this game apart from the other ARTS games is the things you DONT see on the surface. Everything is manipulatable, which translates to the evolution of a large variety of strategies that continues to expand after so many years. Things like creep pulling, stacking, lane control, etc are little nuances that may seem irrelevant to the untrained eye, but as you evolve as a player, you\u0027d realize these little things help so much in the metagame. In extreme cases in high level play, a game can be said to be one from the moment you pick your heroes. This high level of strategic thinking is something other multiplayer games cannot achieve and is something is refined and evolved from community enacted plays over these years. I\u0027m running out of space to write more about this game. Just know this, this game is WORTH IT.… ",

And yes, you will get one idiot who reports you for not knowing what to do, but hey, they\u0027re idiots, just remember that. The only time I had to report someone was when he was stealing my last-hits as a support and when I repeatedly kept telling him to do the opposite, he kept on doing it, and no, he wasnt a different nationality. Another thing I love about the game is the in-depth trading and cosmetic item system, quite similar to Team Fortress 2. I love the way people can design items on the workshop and then be able to have them sold on the official store. People have also made unofficial trading websites where players can make offers for trades, or place bets on tournament matches. Yes, the community can be a bit uptight sometimes, but they are just passionate people who love the game, although it may not seem that way. If you are new, occasionally, you will get one player who will be willing to help you learn, there have been days where thats all my friend and I do, help new players in public matches to get better at the game and to learn its rules and strategies. I think DotA 2 is a step up from other MOBA\u0027s like LoL, and i can almost guarantee that one day it will be as popular… ",

Speaking of balanced the game is not ex actually balanced, although it may be argued that everything can be countered, at a low level this is unknown and therefore the players who choose the most common characters such as zeus and drow ranger will always dominate the game and therefore will progress further up the learning curve.

Neither of the other two competitors of Dota 2 (strife doesn\u0027t really count as the perspective is totally different) really offers both depth and reliable management that the Valve production team brings to the table. League of Legends may be backed by a reputable company that truly cares about the game, but the game really doesn\u0027t have the depth. HoN, on the other hand, may have some depth, but the company that developed it is completely detached from the community. They are all about short term revenue goals with the early access heroes that are often overpowered and weird avatars that actually change the attack animation (read: often benefit the people who can pay for them). Valve listens to the community and asks for input for item suggestions. The community is pretty toxic, but that\u0027s the situation with EVERY moba game out there. Don\u0027t kid yourself that LoL is less toxic. Just because the game doesn\u0027t have native voice chat, doesn\u0027t mean the people playing are any more friendly. This is by far the best moba game and is the true successor to Dota 1.… ",

Since there are so many negative reviews, I will address their issues first. There are two broad kinds of people who play Dota 2, and you will recognise them straight away. One is the player who doesn\u0027t whine, and the other is the player who does. Those who whine can be recognised easily, because they have the glorious, 12-year-old attitude that is unmistakable. If they\u0027re winning, they will be cheeky in chat about their victory, and if they lose, they will flame at everyone and every action everyone took in the game except themselves and their own actions. I believe I fit into the former category, and this is reflected in that I have never been muted. Those who are in the latter are those that post on the Steam Dota 2 community discussion forums, complaining that they get muted everyday. Check them out if you want to have a laugh. Also, when you\u0027ve played the game and got used to it, come back on here and read the zero-rated reviews; they will also make you laugh at how deluded they are. But, of course, none of what I just said, really matters. How you play is down to you. Yes, it\u0027s a very hard game to learn, and yes, there will be many matches that annoy you, but stick with it. There will be many times when you die and think to yourself, \"wtf just happened?\", but this passes when you learn the heroes. If you are expecting, or hoping, to win every game, don\u0027t even bother installing it. I played a lot of LoL before playing Dota 2, and oh my god, I\u0027m so glad I found this game. I\u0027ve never looked back. It is much more player skill-based than LoL. You don\u0027t need to get summoner levels, or pay, to have runes, masteries, summoner spells... Everything you need to win, you have from your first game. There are no \"external influences\", if you will, like runes and masteries. Everything is down to your hero, the items you have, and how good you are with them. Another difference from LoL is that invisibility is a hugely prevalent annoyance. You can buy invisibility in this game fairly cheaply, and some champions either have permanent invisibility or can be almost permanently invisible. Fighting these heroes will probably be your first struggle. If you meet Riki, Bounty Hunter, Clinkz and some others, remember the arsenal of anti-stealth that you can buy! Sentry wards will reveal them so you can farm safer in lane, and something special (and cheap!) that you wont find in LoL is Dust of Appearance. If an enemy nearby goes invisible, use Dust to reveal them! A more risky and much more expensive, but sometimes better investment, is the Gem of True Sight. It grants you true sight like a permanent Oracle\u0027s Elixir, however if you die, it drops from your body and an enemy could steal it and use it against you! Also, you can find weapon and armor \u0027skins\u0027 for your heroes without having to pay. You can pay if you wish, of course, so it does kind of nullify the common, uncommon, rare, mythical branding of items. In my opinion, rare and mythical items should only be found by playing, so that their rarity is actually reflected by how many will have found them by braving the game. But this is Valve we\u0027re talking about, so that wont ever happen as sales will be down. Also, the game does have its annoying bugs. At the time of writing, assuming they haven\u0027t just fixed it with the patch that is being downloaded right now, I have a bug where I can\u0027t select or attack enemy wards. Annoying, but hardly game-changing. I wouldn\u0027t worry about this too much. Anyway, I hope I didn\u0027t ramble on too long on single topics, but I want to say what\u0027s important for those who haven\u0027t played yet but who want to. Good luck, have fun!… ",

It takes on average around 15-20 minutes just to start a game, sometimes closer to 30 minutes. This is because it usually takes around the 7-10 minute range to find a lobby, and 50% of the time from there someone either drops out or leaves, causing the whole process to start over again. Compare this to LoL where it takes probably around a minute on average to find and start a game. So you\u0027d think with all that time being spent finding people to match with it would be due to the complex algorithms being performed on the back end for their magnificent matchmaking system, right? WRONG I\u0027ve never even SEEN a matchmaking system more broken. Every god damn game of Dota 2 is a steamroll for one side. If you\u0027re winning it just gets easy as hell and you can play as sloppy as you want. If you\u0027re losing there is pretty much nothing you can do to make a comeback, and you\u0027re then forced to watch the other team toy with you instead of ending the game. And you can\u0027t agree to a surrender in like oh I don\u0027t know EVERY OTHER MOBA GAME EVER MADE. Seriously.. why the can\u0027t your team agree to a surrender? Why do you have to just sit there while the other team kills you IN YOUR FOUNTAIN? You can\u0027t leave the game because you basically are tracked for games you leave, so what are you forced to do after this game you already spent 20 minutes waiting for and 50 minutes playing a lopsided unfun steamroll on? Wait 10 more minutes and just watch the other team toy with you, like happens every god damn game. Horribly horribly inexcusable to not have a surrender option. The lack of a surrender, long match making times, and horrible match making of skill is where I downrate this game mostly. The other reasons I downrate it are the before mentioned horrible snowballing this game employs. If anyone on a team feeds AT ALL it\u0027s GAME OVER. disgraceful. The other thing is the game simply is laughably imbalanced. For instance, some characters just suck complete ass, like the brood mother. You can\u0027t ever use her spiderling skill because a.) they aren\u0027t even that good, but more importantly b.) They give the enemy experience when they die, and most importantly c.) They give the enemy gold when they die. Considering how weak they are, any decent AOE spell is going to kill em all and put the enemy WAY ahead of you, like basically a heroe kill\u0027s worth of gold and exp. It\u0027s ridiculous. And it\u0027s pointless to use the spiders in any other way than bunched up, because on their own they can\u0027t do **** Compare that to a phantom lancers illusions which give NO GOLD and basically NO EXP when killed, yet they are probably close to 100x more useful than a spiderling. SO MUCH SENSE BEING MADE BY THIS GAME. And you can easily see on the stats that the game is horribly imbalanced, broodmother has something like a 37% win rate, so I have facts to back up my statements. THAT IS NOT A SIGN OF A WELL-BALANCED GAME PEOPLE. Aside from all that the game plays well, a lot of the heroes actually are designed well, such as spirit breaker and pudge. The game requires much more skill than LoL to play which is something that I like. Landing a Pudge hook from long range or concealed areas is infinitely cooler than landing any skillshot in LoL, and the heroes are much more dynamic in their move sets.… ",

The community is what you make of it, if you play with random people and don\u0027t make an effort to play with people you know and just do constant solo matchmaking, you aren\u0027t going to enjoy yourself on ANY MOBA that is out today. There is a steep learning curve and people do expect after about 100 games for you to understand the basics, so if you are a casual gamer who doesn\u0027t want to have to do a little bit of reading then I would suggest move on. On the other hand if advanced strategy mixed with fast paced team PvP sound like your niche then you should definitely check it out.… ",

First major problem is a conceptual one below-average dynamics resulted from RTS-style control, that is in fact not suitable at all for action games, which Dota is supposed to be. This game hasn\u0027t got a single reason to have RTS control, there are just a few heroes who have summons so you may need RTS conrol in it. This game originally as Dota on Wc3 engine was born for Wc3 fans as a custom map, just to have fun in between common games. It definitely doesn\u0027t deserve a standalone game and especially as a competitive one. Just because its idea doesn\u0027t fit its technical implementation. There\u0027re dozens of creeps running around, but you still control only one hero and a courier for your items. That\u0027s not a game for RTS control. This problem results in low dynamics, there\u0027s no intensity in any \"action\" in the game apart from teamfights (which occupy no more than 10% of game time) and occasionally laning (early phase of the game when you\u0027re supposed mostly to kill creeps and force your enemies back). The majority of time is a \"positional war\" with 1-2 heroes in a team farming creeps to get items and eventually to carry the game. Rare tactics (which are hardly seen on a competitive scene) can include fast-push (taking down towers and rushing for enemy base from the first minutes) or very massive gangs (killing enemy heroes) to suspend enemy development. They are not effective and there\u0027s nothing done by developers to improve the situation, just not to break a fragile close-to-balance state. The second major problem of this game is it being unbalanced. There are almost always a few (~10 out of 100+) heroes in the game that are holding the trend. You may see them is 80% of the games. And there are about 30% of heroes that are almost never picked. In some patches you may even have one hero that may alone carry the whole game even if player puts no effort in playing, unless enemies have a strong counter-pick and act almost flawlessly to negate a single hero\u0027s power. And that\u0027s after about 8 years (since IceFrog took the game and made it \"serious\") of constant development and balance improvements. Due to its \u0027overcomplexity\u0027 any patches applied to the game can change the situation only in terms of which heroes exactly are most picked/most winning but not the rates, but there are still 60% winning rate for some heroes and 40% for others. Third problem (a lesser one) is non-friendliness for newcomers. It\u0027s difficult not only to master the game, but also just to get a motion in a right direction. And no guides can actually help you. Your performance while you are a newcomer is determined by whether you have an experienced friend in a voice chat who will constantly explain you every single detail of any action you are going to take, should it be picking a hero, leveling skills, getting items or acting in fights. You can forget about learning how to play this game even as a below average player before you put about 1000 hours in it, unless (as stated before) you have a trainer (a really skilled trainer) who\u0027s going to teach you any time you play. Also, the game is overestimated as a competitive one. Most professional gamers you can see on a top-scene were playing it for at least 4 years. The majority were playing it since early Dota1 for more than 6 years. The fourth problem is its community, which is (and always was for some reason I can\u0027t explain) extremely unfriendly and aggressive. This adds negative experience equally for newcomers and for veteran players. Assuming that even after almost two years of beta-testing there\u0027s still no adequate matchmaking system (it\u0027s not developers\u0027 fault by the way, the \"skill\" in this game is too vague to determine it even manually, what can we say about automated system) it results in a big gap in skill among players that are matched in the same game which itself results in players constantly insulting each other based on their performance.… ",

If you play/playedI started playing this coming from League of Legends since I wanted to try something new. I highly do not recommend this game unless you know what it is going into it, it is extremely unfriendly to new users and you will probably get flamed every game even bot games. If you do play or have played DOTA 1, I recommend it since it is a nice improvement on the original. If you play/played League of Legends, DOTA 2 will probably get you to start playing League of Legends again as it did for me. While most people think the simplified stats make it easier, I find that it just means if your primary stat is intelligence, you\u0027re getting screwed late game. Pros: - Very in-depth for this type of game and the champion interaction is refreshing. - In-game graphics are a lot better than League of Legends and the client loads significantly faster. - Truly Free to play since you don\u0027t need to unlock champions with any game currency or what not. - In-game voice chat works well most of the time, although the sensitivity slider has been very buggy. - Made me appreciate League of Legends more. Cons: - Community is the worst since... well... ever... - The game has a ridiculously steep learning curve and is painful to climb. - Every champion is overpowered at first so that no thought has to be put into balancing, then late game anyone that relies on abilities gets the shaft since they don\u0027t scale with your stats. - Turrets hardly seem to do any damage and I\u0027ve seen turret dives at very early levels. - Losing gold upon death just means you are even further behind then before making the game quickly snowball in the winning team\u0027s favor. - Denying minions and turrets is also aggravating as heck when you are short on gold. - Only one map and one mode. - League of Legends has Runes and Masteries, while not very powerful alone, they do add a lot of customization that dota 2 needs since the only customization at the moment is purely aesthetic. - The camera sucks... period. It never zooms back far enough so you end up having to take focus off of your character just to auto-attack. - Roaming the map is annoying at times since trees are misleading upon which you can walk through and which you can\u0027t. Overall: If you played DOTA 1 and loved it, play DOTA 2. If you have never played DOTA or even LoL, try League of Legends first.… ",

I was shocked when I heard the announcement that VALVe was publishing this game. After all, this game was originally a mod for Warcraft III, a really fun strategy game made by Blizzard Entertainment for the PC. VALVe is a company well known for their first person shooters (Half-Life, Team Fortress, Counter-Strike), so I was wondering why they were even entering Blizzard\u0027s territory with this game. My questions were soon put to rest when I played the game. All I can say is that this game is simply amazing. To start, the gameplay is a mixture between Real-Time Strategy and role-playing games. In this game however, you are not controlling your factions, you are only controlling your heroes. Basically, your heroes level up over time like in a Role-playing game, and the way you control them is like a strategy game. This is actually quite a good mixture. It worked in Warcraft III, and it works perfectly here. However, there is more to the gameplay than just that. This game pits two mighty teams against each other (the radiant and the dire). One side is noticeably more heroic, guarding a lush green forest, while the other is noticeably darker, guarding an ashen wasteland. The overall goal is to destroy the enemy team\u0027s ancient (base of operations). To do this, you really need to coordinate with your teammates, and let them know what is happening around the battlefield. I think that this is a very good approach, especially considering that the game is entirely multiplayer. The graphics of this game are also quite good. Everything is quite beautiful, and enjoyable for anyone who loves video game graphics. There is no real story to this game, which although I have criticized in the past, I don\u0027t feel the need to here. All of the characters in this game have their own stories to read if you ever want a good story in this game. There is only one real complaint that I have with this game as a matter of fact. This game does have a very steep learning curve. It is easy to learn, but incredibly difficult to master. You need to find a hero that suits your playstyle, which if you ask me, can take ages to figure out considering that there are over one-hundred of them. However, having over one-hundred heroes is not a bad thing. In fact, I\u0027d say it\u0027s a great thing. It gives you so much more variety on what kind of hero you can play as. Overall, I\u0027d say that this is another fantastic game by VALVe software. It is ultra-competitive, fast, furious, and one heck of a lot of fun. It\u0027s steep learning curve may be a tad bit problematic, however, that does not stop me from awarding this game with a 9 out of 10.… ",

It\u0027s very fun and here Valve are just laughing at the bank with the game as people loved the origonal so much. In this case, you might as well just give your money to valve, it\u0027s making that much. Very fun RPG, yet hard to explain. You get to pick a character, level him/her/it up and the objective is to destroy the enemy base. Each base creates small creatures called \"creeps\" and you gain gold for xp by killing creeps and destroying towers. In this case the creeps are red-shirts, running into battle and no real loss when they die. You can download it for free, spectator a match and see what you think. what do you have to lose? Since then they\u0027ve exited beta and now you can take on a tutorial to learn more about the game rarther than put up with the difficult learning curve that I had to suffer with having never touched Dota2 before.… ",

The only things purchasable in game are cosmetics and tournament passes. Dota 2 is essentially the exact same game as DoTA except that it has been ported to Valve\u0027s source engine. The menus and user interface are extremely streamlined and includes tournament integration if there is one in progress. The game has a harsh learning curve that not everyone will be able to appreciate. But, it is highly rewarding once you learn the game. The community is not nearly as toxic as other reviewers are trying to make it out to be. Most of these reviewers are probably overly sensitive people to begin with. The community that I\u0027ve been exposed to may be slightly elitist, but that\u0027s to be expected from a game with this competitive nature and learning curve. However, although elitist most of the players are willing to give advice and help out if they are asked to. Don\u0027t let one toxic player ruin your experience of this amazing game. The game is smooth, tightly integrated, stays true to its predecessor, and has possibly the best matchmaking system of any MOBA to date. If you\u0027re a fan of the genre and want a challenge then this is the game to be playing. If not, then look elsewhere.… ",

This is the only truly \"Free To Play\" game in this genre; you start off with every hero in the game, there\u0027s no rune system that benefits those who buy rune pages/boosts/play more than you do, and all in-game store items are purely cosmetic. On top of that you can actually win cosmetic items for the heros just by playing the game. I will not discuss the actual gameplay in great depth Plenty of people do that already, suffice to say that it has the most complex mechanics out of any Trilane-based game. The engine works very well, looks great, and lacks the issue of \"spell clutter\" often found in a game like Leage of Legends, where so many spells are going off in huge, obnoxious colors it\u0027s hard to know what\u0027s going on In general, once you know what to spot in Dota 2, you can analyze team fights with ease. Whether its gameplay is better or worse than LoL, in my opinion, is personal preference to how difficult you want the basic game mechanics to be, and how casual of a player you are if you like competitive, hardcore gaming, Dota 2 is better suited to you. Both games are smooth, work well, look good, and offer satisfying gameplay, but for a different crowd. There is a huge caveat though that I feel the need to mention, where this game lacks behind its competitors; The community, the leaver system, the matchmaking, the lack of region locks, and the HUD, altogether, make what should be an incredible gaming experience an incredibly frustrating one. Leavers are quite rare in League of Legends. They are generally heavily penalized and most people avoid them at higher summoner levels, because of the level of time investment necessary to get a free account to such a high level, the length of bans due to leaving too often, the tribunal system, and how active the community is in using its report system and enforcing it. The community, as hard as it is to believe, is actually worse in Dota 2 than in any other MOBA I have played, In part because of all the other issues mentioned. Integrated microphones without region locks mean people from Russia will queue as teams on American servers, not speak english, and talk in russian all game, or curse at you in english and just troll all game. A limit of 2 reports a week, which can only result in a global mute for a short period of time (and quite rarely) does absolutely nothing to deter trolls and leavers. When someone leaves a game, after 5 minutes, everyone can start leaving the game without any consequence, and whoever is left over will decide whether it\u0027s a win or a loss. Meaning some dude on your team rage quits, after 5 minutes 2 other members of your team leave, and you\u0027re instant loss. The Matchmaking is absurd. I\u0027ve played matches with people who have more than 10 times the games I\u0027ve played, and people with 10 times less games than I\u0027ve played, on the same team, in the same match. (100 wins 10 wins 1000 wins, for example, same team). And the gap of game knowledge is beyond apparent, it\u0027s gross and it reinforces the negativity of the community due to frustration from the new player for playing inadequately and probably being berated by his team, anger at the experienced player for losing his time, and a negative atmosphere for absolutely everyone else in the game. One of the biggest failures in this game, is that for a game that claims to be much more suited around competitive play, it surely should have a scaling HUD, like LoL does as a casual game? Guess what, no. No it doesn\u0027t. The HUD is The size of it and pure amount of dead space blocking your screen gives you severe disadvantages when approaching situations from certain angles. Also I cannot count on 2 hands the amount of times I right clicked on the minimap while escaping from enemies (playing Radiant) and turning around and running back into their team. I\u0027ve never done this in LoL, ever. In the end, it doesn\u0027t matter if it\u0027s the best MOBA I\u0027ve ever played mechanics wise if 1 out of 2 games are incredibly unpleasant to participate in because of these issues. And while I respect Valve and Icefrog for being focused on balancing above all else, not taking active measures to make the community better, and being purely passive about accepting such negative and counter-productive behavior, will eventually kill everything but the most hardcore of fans. 5/10. Only worth playing for hardcore fans of complex, deep MOBA systems Those with little time to waste, casual players, or those with difficulty dealing with trolls/leavers/bad attitudes should look elsewhere for a more fun-oriented, lower stress MOBA.… ",

While League of Legends is often the one most compared to dota, the two are vastly different and drawing this parallel is futile as their target audiences are wholly different. To make something absolutely clear, every single hero is a viable option, it all depends upon the player\u0027s style, skill level, and the team composition. Many will tout that this game\u0027s lacking is in its community, yet do not strive to take the effort to find the players worth adding as friends and developing partners whom compliment your play style. You might as well say your local coffee shop has a bad community, but that doesn\u0027t accurate reflect the coffee shop as a whole does it now? To those new, give it time. It\u0027s a game that (very much like counter strike) you have to take a bit more seriously to truly enjoy. Once you hit the base level of understanding specific characters and being rewarded for such, it\u0027s a satisfaction unlike any other.

There is a training mode which teaches you how to do most things in the game. There is also bot matches which puts you and 4 computer controlled players against 5 computer controlled players.

However after reading some of the ridiculous \"0\" reviews for this game I found it necessary to defend Dota 2. - Yes the game looks like the old War Craft 3 in regards to map, direction etc. it\u0027s supposed to. Valve\u0027s intentions were to update the old game but to keep it true to the original, there is nothing wrong with this. - Yes the learning curve is very steep, for me this was my first MOBA and while it was challenging to start out in the game I have been playing it for over a year and it\u0027s highly rewarding. For me it actually took a fair bit of time watching the game and doing some research in order to progress at a quicker pace. - People say this is \"broken\" or unbalanced which couldn\u0027t be further from the truth. All of the heroes in the game have their place and can be useful and powerful in certain situations. One hero may seem to be over powered to you but that\u0027s because you aren\u0027t familiar enough with their weaknesses or a hero to proper counter any perceived \"OPness\". There isn\u0027t a single hero in DOTA 2 that is OP, all of them can be stopped if you use the right strategy. - It\u0027s highly likely you struggled with the game because generally in the newbie queue all the players want to play agility carries, you all just want to go kill stuff but that\u0027s not how the game works. There needs to be a proper balance between supports, mid game/semi carries and late game carries. Do yourselves a favour if you are starting the game new, play support heroes. You already have no clue what you are doing, it\u0027s best to have no clue while you are support those who might have an idea. This will allow you to get into the game while not playing as important a role. (not that support isn\u0027t important, at higher levels it\u0027s just as difficult to play good support as to carry if not more so). And don\u0027t be a greedy support, in most cases all you need is a magic wand, boots and in some cases maybe a blink dagger/force staff. Other than these items you should be buying wards, dust, smoke etc. all while protecting your carry and NOT stealing his farm. - For those who gave this game a 0 they obviously didn\u0027t put the time in, until you actually understand all the heroes in the game you can\u0027t comprehend the depth involved to play this game at a higher level. For those who are willing to put the time in the game is excellent and should be experienced the price is definitely right.… ",

There are so many trolls in this game that can ruin the whole game for you if you play solo. I don\u0027t want to sound racist but most of the trolls are russian, sadly this is a fact and has grown to a real problem. When valve finaly solves the problem with the russian speaking players who really dont think about comunicating with their english-speaking teammates, I will rate this game 10/10. It is really time consuming and I would not recommend to start playing when you have important stuff to do.… ",

It is nice to have all the heroes available from the start. Too bad over half the heroes are never used. I have tried many of the so called weak underpowered heroes and to be honest, they do have problems. Over-all, it is a well-made game that is very unforgiving to new players. The tutorial is great and helps players to learn the basic laning skills and abilities of each hero. However, once you start playing against other people, everything changes. Hopefully you are a patient person or you might end up breaking your monitor in frustration. Part of that frustration comes from the community: very toxic and nasty. The reporting system for the game is a joke which means that the behavior will not change anytime soon. Here is my advice, if you have a group of friends who can log on with you and will work together as a team; then you have the potential to be successful in DoTA 2 and have fun. I am guessing this applies to middle/ high school students and college students with too much time. If you have a job and responsibilities and can only solo play, you might want to pass on this game and find something else. League of Legends has a somewhat nicer community and a better reporting system. The game is a lot more forgiving to new players; however the same problem of needing a group if you want to become ranked still applies. Anyway, play at your own risk if you are a solo player.… ",

It is, without doubt, an improvement on the old formula and yet remarkably true to it. DOTA 2 looks great and feels great, but if you\u0027re coming from games like League of Legends or Heroes of Newerth, you\u0027ll feel like a fish out of water. It\u0027s not that the game is different in formula, but rather it\u0027s very different mechanically. You\u0027ll have to learn how to play this game almost from scratch, but it will be well worth the journey. This game has a tremendous skill gap, but it also offers the best tools in the genre for learning the game. Bots come in 5 difficulties, from Passive to Unfair and the tutorial, so far, is a pretty good learning tool though I suspect it will be improved over time. The hero line-up is impressive, diverse, and intriguing. The map is true to the old DOTA formula, but flows quite differently from what you might be used to. Just to name a few of the dominant mechanics you\u0027ll have to learn and hone are: side/secret shops, couriers, item sharing, and teleporting. The differences hardly stop there, but even just these few are such dramatic differences from what players know that they serve as an adequate sampling of just what\u0027s so different about this version of DOTA. DOTA 2 doesn\u0027t just bring the RTS back to MOBAs (this game feels far more like managing a Starcraft or Warcraft 3 battle than it\u0027s predecessors), but it\u0027s also causing seismic activity in the games industry itself with its super accessible item shop. It\u0027s more like a DOTA 2 marketplace than a simple shop. Not only can players buy anything from soundpacks to UI skins to items to characters, but players can also make these items ...and then sell them right there on Steam. Never has getting into the games industry as an artist been as accessible as Valve has made it. With their track record of opening up the development process to their modders, this is a very promising feature that I\u0027m sure they\u0027ll do better than all the competition. The game isn\u0027t without it\u0027s flaws, though. The matchmaking needs strong improvement and greater enforcement of language filters. Performance is pretty good, though it seemed unserviceable at times. However, with the International only recently ending, it\u0027s difficult to tell how much of the issues were just extremely high server traffic and how much was actual issues with game stability. All in all, though, this game has fewer flaws than features and since it\u0027s free to play, the offerings are prime. I highly recommend lovers of MOBA gaming to dive into DOTA 2. It does a wonderful job of requiring truly skillful gameplay by bringing that RTS feel back into the game.… ",

For example, I raved about world of warcraft when I had a community of friends/guilds to play with but hated to game when those relationships waned. Dota2 is similar. If you don\u0027t have friends to play with you may beIt\u0027s hard to separate an online game from it\u0027s community and be objective about it, because let\u0027s face it, when it comes to online games the community often makes the game. For example, I raved about world of warcraft when I had a community of friends/guilds to play with but hated to game when those relationships waned. Dota2 is similar. If you don\u0027t have friends to play with you may be left wanting more. The reason is the US servers aren\u0027t locked at all so often times you have a lot of eastern europeans who speak very little English or a lot of south americans. The south americans are worse, they tend to be in groups or 2 or 3 and use the in game chat as a social hours going back in forth in Spanish or Portuguese the entire time (that\u0027s why private mumble servers are for). When I play with my friends we use mumble and only use in game chat for relevant in game things. If we want to vent about a player or socialize we keep it out of the game. And other times you just get plain old jerks who always roll carry heroes, complain if you don\u0027t babysit the crap out of them despite their bad positioning, poor farming, overall lack of knowledge etc. In short the community is hit or miss. Half the games suffer from obnoxious players while half are fine. There\u0027s also some serious matchmaking issues. Skill levels are rarely equal unless you queue with a full group. Valve also hides their matchmaking ratings so you don\u0027t really know why or how you got in the match you got into. I\u0027ll go from a match against obvious brand new players to one against a full 5 who are on top of everything. So again hit or miss. As far as gameplay though I couldn\u0027t ask for a more balanced and well designed game. The graphics are mediocre but the art style is good and I love the brightness of it. Compared to Heroes of Newerth (HoN) it looks so much more appealing. Some complain a lot about the animations say they\u0027re too slow and your heroes react far to slow, but this is appealing to me as well and part of the strategy. Not every hero last hits at the same pace so you need to learn them. By contracts HoN seemed very frantic to me without much time between decisions because every animation is so fast. The balance and strategic depth are amazing. Valve does a great job patching and keeping every hero in order. There\u0027s so much strategy to picking teams and counter matchups and what to do in your lanes. It\u0027s a deceptive deep game. The downside is this creates a very high skill barrier to entry. It takes literally 30-50 games to understand the nuances of the game at all. Many players will become frustrated with this learning curve and simply won\u0027t like the game and that\u0027s fine. It\u0027s not for everyone. But if you take the time to learn what you\u0027re doing it\u0027s a wonderful pvp game. There\u0027s a few things I think could be done a lot better like more maps, fixing the matchmaking, etc. There also really needs to be a vote to surrender and end obvious losses earlier. A blowout can be recognized 20 mins in but take another 20 mins to resolve. In general tech support is very good, game almost never crashes. Overall judging the game for what it is, I give it a 9 because it simply is the best of the moba genre. But if you don\u0027t like mobas or online games stay away. If you want to really enjoy all dota2 has to offer do yourself a favor, dive in, expect to lose your first 10 games or so, read a lot of guides, watch some youtube clips and find a group of friends to play with.… ",

Match making is based on experience, records, roles, etc of a player, but some players as me, keep geting horrible teammates with bad behaviour, quiters, \"reporters\" (troll that report u for nothing), noobs, and first time players. making me lose, and getting a bad record, that send me more players like those... this must change. 2. Server Locations \u0026 Filters: US, EU, LA, everywhere we get russians, (we all agree that rusians trolls can be rly insane), if i want russians i would pick RU server, why i keep getting them? dunno... Dota should have an auto critic bar, where i say witch my level is, so he can do a better job matchmaking. If the player is right about the level, then the bar stay still, if dont, it goes down. 3. Reports: i know this have perma fixes and changes everyday, but we are not ok with the way it works atm. Actually u can be a pro and be banned by trolls whom report you. That its insane, there should be certain of restrictions on who, how, and when u report players with better record than you. Las and more important... 4. THE INTERNATIONAL TOURNAMENT How do teams participate? rules? request? where to sign? Steam/Valve is very noob there, this game requires more tournaments, and more important, Regional Tournaments (Like Soccer world cup, but less corrupted). SEA Tournaments, South America Tournaments, Central America Tournaments... This is crucial in order to get a better community and better gamers.

The Basic structure of dota is to defend your base while destroying the enemy\u0027s base while controlling a particular character(termed as hero) in a team of up to 5 players. Dota 2 offers better graphics, animations as well better voice overs and hero customisation(in terms of looks). Developed by Icefrog himself, who is the original creator of the DoTA-Allstars map for Warcraft III game, its all that and plus more. The DoTA Store is one of the prime features of the game, offering items for customising the hero looks as well as other appearance changing items like HUD skins, couriers, tournament passes, etc. You can play matches and earn items or you can buy them directly from the store or you can even trade items from other players. Valve has stepped up their matchmaking algorithms providing better-scaling of player skills. You can even spectate pro-matches(with tournament passes if need be) from inside the game. Icefrog takes suggestions from the community so that none of the heroes in-game are overpowered or underpowered and the game balance is maintained. If you do however, learn dota\u0027s basics, its a hell lot of fun to play casually with friends. The sheer number of strategies that can be employed, because of the hero pool of almost a 100 heroes(more to come) and more than 200 items, ensure that you will never be bored of repetition to say the least. DoTA is one of those games, that is here to stay. It will be played by many and it will be played for a long time until a better competitor comes into play. Overall I feel, DoTA 2 is a really fun game after you get the basics down. Its even more fun if you have friends to play it with.… ",

However, there are a lot of people like me, who don\u0027t care about a learning curve since we don\u0027t feel the need to be a pro immediately. People like me, and possibly you, enjoy the challenge of mastering the game slowly. If this is the case, the learning curve is only a positive point. 2 the community There is no way to describe this in a friendly way. MOBA communities are generally atrocious. DOTA 2 is no exception. If you combine this with the high learning curve, this will drastically lower the fun for newer players. Personally i think this game is really worth the time and investment. Even with a high learning curve, the game only becomes more fun and satisfying the better you get. This is mostly because you feel you are achieving something. Still, i highly advise to find at least one friend to play with. Optimal situation is if this friend is on the same skill level as you. GL HF in you coming DOTA 2 career.

The game itself is REALLY hard for beginners. But don\u0027t let that discourage you! It is really worth learning everything, though it might take more than 50-100 in-game-hours to fully comprehend the most of what you should do. You can always learn something new in the game, but the beginners might be a little confused. The game itself has some things which are considered bugs but actually are intentional mechanics (such as the Pudge-Fountain hook with Chen) but if there is a bug Dota mostly tries to fix it as soon as possible. The characters over all are MOSTLY balanced. Though there are, in my opinion, some characters that are easier than others, which makes them seem totally op if you play decent, and others not even close to good if you play them like a professional. While I say this I am thinking about Spirit Breaker, Sniper or a well played Pudge. These are the only characters they really should nerf, because you can\u0027t do ANYTHING if pudge lands a hook, spirit charges you or sniper perma-stuns you with headshot. Besides that I like the balancing a lot. If you come to the community this game really shows it\u0027s downside. People are complete a**holes when it comes to small things like picking or laning. If they see 3 hard carrys picked they are going to pick a 4th one instead of a much needed support. This also screws up the lanes and a lot of people don\u0027t listen to more experienced players when it comes to laning or small things like mechanics. The report buttons are not even close to be enough. There is report-button for quitters, trolling or people who simply just don\u0027t listen to people who have more experience then them. It really sucks not to be able to report someone like this. Another thing I want to talk about are russians. I have no Idea what a russian is supposed to do on an english west-europe server but they are still there and it sucks. They will, no matter what you tell them, do exactly what they want, don\u0027t speak english at all, even though you searched for the english language-preference and they will ruin your game big time. And this holds to be true for about 97,2% of the russians you meet in dota. The communication with the team is overall quite okay, most people will react if you tell them something or suggest what you could do next. Of chourse, it happens from time to time that they won\u0027t even listen to you, but that is rarely the chase. But my overall impressions after over 400 hours of playing: I love this game. If you play with 4 friends you won\u0027t have the problem that you have to deal with russians or idiots. This makes the game a lot cooler. Beginners might have trouble but it is really worth checking out, and I say that though I don\u0027t like MOBAs, so this really means something. … ",

The graphics aren\u0027t the best in the world when compared to games like Crysis 3, but it uses a modified and updated source engine. It\u0027s well optimized to the point that I can even play it easily with an hd4000 integrated chip without issues. From one of the other reviews about frame rate, there can be some lag when you play on bad connections. It\u0027s not quite optimization, but rather based on your connection as with any online game. If you want to pick up this game, I would suggest looking at other pros playing it to see what goes into the game. It\u0027s also very helpful to pick it up with some other friends as it is a multiplayer game. It\u0027s f2p, so you don\u0027t loose anything by doing so. Good luck on your journey in playing DOTA2.

Dota 2 is lilttle bitt different if we compare to other MOBAS, there is alot more things you can do. Like courier system, you can hide woods (not like in LoL), you can cut woods down to make yourself good escape, secret shops, rune spawns etc. Game is very friendly for players who havent played before MOBAS, there is long training before you can go and play against other players (For me it took like 40mins, after that you can continue or skip straight to play with other players) Anyway, since its more new player friendly there is problems. First of all, Ive been playing alot MOBAS and im pretty good in those. Problem is that game is pretty full of casual gamers, who actually dont use brains even people who haves like 500+ wins, may be pretty bad players. Lets talk now little bit about good things. In dota 2 waiting lines are not big and also you can choose region near your country there is alot options. You can also buy new items to your heroes to make it look more unique, you can use items from different sets. In League of legends and Heroes of newerth you can buy \"skins\" and you cannot took gloves from skin X and boots from skin Y. You are also able to buy several different ancouncer voices, ward skins, HUD skins and couriers. Next lets move to settings. There is not much resolution options, but you can modify pretty extensively other settings. I hope valve is going to make more resolution optison in future. Gameplay in dota 2 is pretty intensive and few heroes are able to use terrain very advantageous, which is cool. Most of heroes are aldready known from original dota version. Last but not least, I want to talk about gaming community. First of all you are able to make teams and play with your friends. You can also make guilds, which havent that big role in dota 2. There is alot people in dota 2, who dont communicate in game and that is such a shame mostly it leads to lose. Of course there is people who communicate aswell, but I have had always bad luck with teams... I prefer this game for people who look more \"hardcore\" way to play MOBAS and for those, who are bored to LoL, HoN etc.… ",

The hate I got that game was horrific. I thought this was just a one off so I tried another match, I ended up not killing or getting killed for a while, and the comments started coming again, and again, and again, and again... This game to put it easily is a 2-sided coin. On one hand the game can be enjoyable if you find a character you can use effectively, however the community is honestly the worst gaming community I ever had the utter misfortune of playing with or being part of, if your not perfect instantly you will be hated. I\u0027d say since the game is free, it\u0027s worth the price for the offline mode but that\u0027s it… ",

Though you guys need to be patient, all the heroes will come out soon inlcuding steams original design for heroes. But sadly, playing Dota 2 frequently or if you have not played Dota means that you are one of the new noobs amongst everyone else who are not sure of how to play. If you want to be a pro i recommend getting Dota and practising with insane bots or getting Garena. It is also completely free. Almost no payments required accept for skins. It is still a more competitive game than LoL and HotN. It almost never gets boring, Though if your after a game with good graphics and not gameplay i suggest something else. What NaaR is talking about is LoL.And i must say Dota 2\u0027s waiting time is way better than LoL. It does deliver very frequently, but yes the fun part is that the suprise of know who is going to play with your or against you, nobody knows but sadly you cant check others ping. A flame fest can start but it depends actually. Its just a luck. But i think the new compendium match is a way to play against those who are competitive. And at least you do not draw the same hero as the opponent team. There is a counteract for each hero in the game unlike LoL where if 1 hero has been made a slight bit easier to play, they will nerf it to the extent that you can no longer stand playing. And unlike LoL there is no mastery or runes and stuff making everyone equal, it just depends whether they know how to play or not.Though for NaaR i recommend LoL on garena servers not american servers. Though despite what I have said, For about 6-8 years of playing Dota I have not found such a big a issue.… ",

I play dota 1 for 10 years. dota 2 is a very bad copy of the game mechanics are good but lacks a system for calculating statistics more detailed (had to implement by taking example from the game server dota 1 dotalicious, the absolute best ever!). Because the statistics are not carefully considered in all respects, and the games are not properly balanced, some players are ridiculous. It also lacks a system of more detailed report of the moderators and active (arrive ban for no reason). A report must be done according to minutes of the game (by checking the replay) and not because a player is annoying you. There is also lack of statistical reports received to check if the player is a recidivist. The reports received must remain on the listing so you can avoid some player. It lacks the ability to swap heroes! The objects to buy are thrown bulk (strength, intelligence, agility, support, all at once!). The break is ridiculous anyone can resume the game (there dovrebber be guaranteed a break of 30 seconds and extendable from your allies than 30 seconds each with a command to the need), usable only once, and the possibility of reactivating only by those who has begun the game break. Overall, in short, is a real disappointment I was hoping to find (after closing dotalicious), a game of dota competent, accurate, instead I find myself with a child\u0027s play ... Truly awful in everything!!… ",

After playing lol for 4 years and having to watch lol go from good to awful thanks to Riot not inability to balance heroes and releasing new gamemodes that ultimately no one cares about and not Riot themselves I got fed up. I used to hate Dota as a mod for WC3, Dota 2 is different. The community issues in Dota remain but are not worse than LoL besides the point that Dota has more leavers, this aside Dota is deeper, more challenging, more strategic, more balanced and customizable than LoL or HoN. You have access to everything and only your skill is a factor for you sucess or failure. Low and high grounds, field of vision night time daytime differs and between heroes even, jungle is more jukable and the lack of summoner spells from LoL makes sure you have no extra safety net. Warding and items are more complex mechanics, math is a bigger factor and teamplay is more encuraged. The fact that valve is not even done with modes and ranked play means that the game will get even better. The trading of items is a game in it self outside the game. Guides for new players written by others can be accessed during matches to help with skill builds and item choices.... So if you can ignore flamers and focus on getting better and improving your play Dota has no equal. Add me ingame if you need help. There are alot of players willing to help not just the ragers.

Matchmaking: The algorithms used by valve are just horrible you don\u0027t know who youre gonna play with or if he/she even speaks your language(even if you select just spanish or just english). you can get to play with noobies or with pros and worse you can get a mixture of both, so in a game you\u0027re a pro and you get a guy that knows how to play 2 that have an idea and 1 that has just started playing and the other team gets 4 good players and 1 that doesn\u0027t. thats an example but its even worse than that cause usually you get noobs all the time that think they can play and they dont and the leave, making you lose the just because someone was trolling them or because they got to stressed. 2. Report System: the RS is just lame. it looks like they didn\u0027t even thought about it. it gives you3 options either to much talking, abuse of skills, and i dont remember the third xD. this gives a chance to bash the hell out of new players by \"pro\" players or people who think they are by saying report X person because he is a noob. 3. DotA Gameplay: The original dota was just as harsh as this one. i mean you don\u0027t know how to play DotA, don\u0027t come and play DotA 2 because your gonna get insulted like never before. 4. Nothing New: It has the same characteristics of DotA 1 except for grapics that are better but the animation problems are still the same,what do i mean by this? in DotA a certain kind of hero let\u0027s say i.e. a wizard would lift his arms up then point at one direction and cast a spell then stood there for 1 sec doing nothing that\u0027s the spell animation of the hero, now when you actually got to learn how to stop this animation from happening all the way, you might say that you know basics. in DotA 2 you have this same problem but as i have tried there\u0027s no stopping some animations, you just have to wait for the 2 sec animation and get pounded while your at it. 5. Shop: I don\u0027t know why they changed the shop style, if they didn\u0027t change anything else why the shop? DotA players knew what letters to what items to buy, now they\u0027re numbers. it completely obliges you to learn all the new numbers and it\u0027s just lazy. 6. The Pro Gameplay: DotA stays the same for pros once you get used to the new commands and the shop. 7: Team matchs: Another Matchmaking error, once you get a few players that you qualify as \"good\" and add them as friends, you can get a team and search with them for matches. This is great if you\u0027re on the team. Horrible if you\u0027re not. you might be a pro but get to play with 5 people that know DotA and you get 4 of them that don\u0027t, Result: POUNDED. 8. Bugs: There are some known bugs out there that you might not know like being in the shadows or a certain kind of spot that even if you\u0027re right beside the hero you won\u0027t see them, again if you don\u0027t know how to play you\u0027re screwed. 9. Basics: The tutorial gives you a veeeeeeery small minded picture of what the game really is, it actually gives you one or two good pointers like, last hitting, and buying potions but that\u0027s about it. thats not DotA. 10. Microphone: the mic feature is great...if you the language of the people that are speaking it, if not it\u0027s just annoying, and worse there are some people whose mics sound ALL THE TIME, like you hear them breathing and stuff like that, just annoying. 11. Community: Again, if you want to play DotA 2, Learn how to play DotA or practice till you can beat the out of Unfair bots, then youre ready to play with people and get ready to be insulted, mistreated, trolled, reported unfairly, screamed at, etc. the community SUCKS. and i mean it. im a pro player and i understand the anger of other players when they get noob players, but i actually surpassed that, now i know that a noob player can be taught, a player that \"thinks\" he is good, doesn\u0027t want to be taught and actually will insult you if you try to give pointers,so in my experience, youre a newbie, say it from the beginning so someone that know how to play helps you but then again, try to beat unfair bots then play with people. 12. Given all of these critics the matchmaking, the report system, the anti-newbie community, the gameplay,etc. i think DotA 2 is a great game for people that know how to play it. but a NIGHTMARE for people that dont.… ",

That said, it is an improved version of the original and fun when things go your way if you stick around long enough. Let me elaborate on my statement that it is not designed to be successful: the learning curve is steep, and painful, even for those who are very familiar with the genre. Until you are at a high competitive level, once you are down you stay down. There are many champions that are very strong against new players that are not very good at all at higher levels of play very anti-fun mechanics leave you muttering and wishing to give up, which is not an option until your opponents choose to end the game, no matter how far behind you are. The lack of protection for new players does allow for more fun and wild champion design, but may not be worth the price. The community remains nearly as toxic as the original, and when you can choose to play a champion that is permanently invisible or can dash across the map and stun you for the entire time it takes to kill you, this isn\u0027t surprising.… ",

Throughout the years I have tried mostly every game within the genre and can\u0027t seem to find a game that offers me the same complexity as DOTA, yet this is just a personal preference of mine. The game and it\u0027s features: DOTA offers a F2P(Free To Play) model unlike any other of it competitors, you open the game and every hero is unlocked and ready for your command, no unlocking anything, so no one have an in-game advantage of any kind. This to me is the only way for a competitive game to present it self. If you want a professional player base, why would you limit newcomers to 5-10% of the hero base? Further more I\u0027m very pleased with the result of DOTA2, smooth movement, each hero feels unique and original. I\u0027ve had my beta key since the earlier stage of the game, and there have been bugs to say the least, I would though have to credit valve for their very fast respond time of fixes, and listening to the community and making changes accordingly. Now the game have been released and I can only think back at the process I have seen this game come through. Must admit I\u0027m huge fan of the result. NOOB go un-install: I\u0027m sincerely sorry for all the new-comers to the game that they have had bad experiences in so many games in a row. But DOTA is an extremely frustrating game you just have to get your head around it, it\u0027s like the first time you play counter-strike and misses everything, the game changes character once you start hitting your opponents before they hit you. The same goes for DOTA once you you figure out how to manage all the little things, the bigger things starts to make more sense. The high learning curve makes this game the most time consuming game I\u0027ve ever played, there is always something new to be learned. This I understand can be a huge challenge to new-comers and to people that somehow lack the patience to learn the essence of why things goes wrong. Luckily I can tell you this; If you keep improving and keep understand how/why things happens, and try to figure out how to avoid the bad things and do more of the good things, you must be willing to learn the mechanics of the game and understand them properly. I have friends who have played this game for years without improving much, the have stopped learning beyond the names of the heroes and their abilities, and they sometimes rage over skype when being out-played by opponents, then i explain to them what happened and why, further more suggestions how to avoid it in the future. Rage will never help you, common sense on the other hand, remember there is a counter to everything and every hero, you just have to figure it out. One does simply not just play good DOTA..… ",

If the people Im partied up with are going to do good based on their character choices, lanes, etc. This game, this game just has everything for parties of 5 or less. However this game has one downfall (Actually more, but one major one). The skill cap is ludicrously high. This makes it hard to get people into the game, as they have to spend literally hundreds of hours learning to just be \"less than average at best\". This makes it hard to get friends to join in on the fun, however, if they do, and they stick to it, it is quite possibly one of the most rewarding games out there period.

With occasional releases of new heroes and rare appearances of new in-game items, the gameplay remains interesting. The servers are also good and multiple servers are available, with new servers constantly being added, to cover the entire globe with good pings. The game is also officially available on LAN which makes it especially interesting for players who cannot benefit the most from online servers (you don\u0027t get any Dota2 player experience or cosmetic item drops if you play on LAN). The game is free to play, besides for purely cosmetic items which do not affect the gameplay in any way. Dota2 is not a pay-to-win style game. Besides Windows, it runs on Linux (Ubuntu) as well. This means that you have to pay NOTHING besides the hardware and bandwidth costs to play this game. That\u0027s definitely next level of free-to-play in the gaming industry. The cosmetic items are regulated very well for quality control and players can get random cosmetic item drops at the end of matches or each Dota2 level upgrade (which is different from in-game hero level upgrade) DotaTV, or the spectator mode, is great. It allows viewing the game from player perspective, event based automated camera, free camera or any caster\u0027s camera. DotaTV also supports in game casting with full audio commentary. The tournaments get great coverage and casters are good too. AND you get additional cosmetic item drop chance while spectating a tournament game (which have rather high community market value) All in all, a great game. Definitely a 10/10 in MOBA and also in free to play games.… ",

The graphics make it difficult to see what exactly is going on and doesn\u0027t get much easier as you progress. Pretty much every champion has at least one ability that will root/stun/slow ect. for around 5 seconds. When a game has that kind of kill security it doesn\u0027t matter if the champions are Balanced. I\u0027ve played many other Game in this genre and besides HoN they were all much more enjoyable than DOTA II. When I first played a game or two It was extremely easy compared to league of legends or other similar games. It may be more difficult to see what\u0027s going on but the spells are so overpowered on all the champions that it was easy coming from game that have underpowered spells. The worst thing About DOTA II would be the Item system that has been Implemented. It\u0027s just ridiculous how it\u0027s not user friendly at all. This game has such a bad In-Game and Community Experience that players Uninstall it after playing 1-3 matches. The fact that this game was for sale when it had been released and is now free to play should tell you all you need to know about it.

Even veterans will make mistakes when trying out new heroes, and they will be flamed too, so why spare the newbies? DotA 2\u0027s growth is amazing. Just take a look at the tournaments. We have the biggest prize pool in e-sports history, and it will increase every year for sure. That says a lot about this game. People pay for it. People earn a living from it, not only from playing, but by casting it too. We have awesome casters like TobiWan, LD, Merlini and much more. They will make tournament games much enjoyable to watch as they already are. As for the gameplay, I\u0027m sure many other reviews had mentioned about it, so I would not waste your time here.

DotA 1 was only a map, and when War3 gets too old there\u0027s concerns about this game that people may give it up some time in the future, and the glory of DotA will be finally forgotten. However, after Valve\u0027s taken their hands on it, they have renewed the masterpiece, and taken it to a new level. They have kept every single thing that\u0027s original in DotA1, every single tree, every skill, every hero, finest details, so that when old players get to play DotA2, they find it all new but all familiar. They know where they could hide in the forests, they know where the wards could be placed, etc. etc. Heroes change their posture upon injured, and if you are hit by the QOP\u0027s dagger you could see a dagger stuck on the hero\u0027s butt. Details like that could cost me days talking about! If the only thing they haven\u0027t restored, it\u0027s got to be the hero models, which are actually impossible to restore because of the copy rights. DotA\u0027s mechanism, no offence, is very complex to every single new player, and is very hard to master. It doesn\u0027t matter how clever you are, but you are certainly almost 100% gonna play like a fool in the first few games. My suggestion is that you play the tutorial, which is the easiest way to learn the game fast. The matchmaking system means you are not likely to be playing against someone who has won 100 times in the first few games in your life (although they could be someone who has already mastered DotA1), so do not take it too seriously. The system allows you to ban all the massages from other players, and if there is someone offending you, he could always be reported. I admit that the community is a bit like chaos right now, because of the sudden increment of players. New players only searching for fun won\u0027t be adoring this game even after months, because DotA is no fun if you don\u0027t know the rules and tricks. I say those because there are certain large amount of players who know nothing about the game itself, but only cursing and offending other players. Why do I value this community? Because DotA is a community-based game. Every game is 5v5, so that people will hear each other, and know each other. It\u0027s not like Battlefield 3 in which there are 32 people in a team and you have no idea who is the rookie. If the DotA community sucks, then the gaming experience sucks, then everything sucks. It is just this simple. Like every other game. DotA is not for everyone. Its most reasonable price means it could be played by everyone, but it\u0027s just a game and have its own fan base. If you don\u0027t like it, you can delete the game and play what you like for losing absolutely nothing. But if you liked it, I guarantee this is still the best choice for you.… ",

But giving it a low score because of its graphics or soundtrack or \"DOTA copied Ashe and named her Drow\" is a terrible reason to not give Dota a chance. . Now the reason why I started LOVING this game is because I didn\u0027t give up like so many others. In order to truly appreciate Dota, go find people, your friends if you have any, and start your training in a party. If you don\u0027t want trolls then just avoid them on your friend\u0027s list. If you want to LEARN and still play in a fixed champion camera (which I don\u0027t recommend), then you can still do so. Trust me when I say, LoL limits your ability to learn as a gamer. You can\u0027t freely choose your champion, so that\u0027s a downer. You can\u0027t play in a party if you’re like level 5 and the other person is level 30 (Trust me; you can\u0027t do nothing to the opponent except harass). Also, I see this in many LoL gamers, once you get too comfortable with a character and decide to stick to it, you start to forget what makes a game both difficult and rewarding. That is why Dota is so deep and immerse. You have to learn to adapt quickly and pay attention to your surroundings because dying hurts...like a lot (you lose money. MAN I NEEDED THAT!). You have to constantly change your character based on the situation, and since they didn\u0027t put in the surrender option, the game literally tells you to NEVER GIVE UP and FIGHT!… ",

They have seriously made no attempt to tell us, the players, anything at all and it\u0027s too much at this point. Diretide 2013 was pretty much guaranteed and they let all the hype build up until the 31st where they still say nothing, and no Diretide is released. Honestly this lack of communication is damaging this game and Counter Strike somewhat died in the same way. This isn\u0027t the first time valve has been lazy too. They used to port heroes like crazy but now you rarely see one hero get added every 5 months. Bugs are everywhere, and they haven\u0027t attempted to improve ranking in the game at all. They are still adamant on hiding our ranks despite showing them in CS:GO, which is solid evidence that showing ranks will not cause everyone to simultaneously freak out and blame valve and their teammates and rage every match (Earth to Valve, this is happening already because everyone thinks they are pro and the matchmaking pretty much matches anyone together at this point). I\u0027m giving this a fair rating.

When Valve decided to take (yet again) another community member idea, and make it into a game slowly but surely that game gets killed. CS was a great game. Look at it now, CS:GO is a shell of was CS 1.6 was back in the day. Ofcourse they up with Source before that but the difference between Source and GO was that Source was actually popular for a period of time. TF2 was initially a very fun team FPS with an interesting theme and simple but effective and fun team class gameplay. The game was decently balanced around it core classes. The came the hats, and even though initially they had guidelines about matching their artsyle it was of course throw away in order to make more money from the communities work for their Steam Marketplace and virtual economy. Then they added new weapons to with the balance and clearly the game became a remnant of what people liked. Honestly you know it\u0027s bad when I\u0027d rather play the console port of TF2 because even the inferior 5 year old port is better than that they up on the PC. They made garbage decisions forgetting why the game was popular to turn it into a money generator. Dota 2 follows very closely in the same footprints Long ago were the days people were optimistic about the spoils of war update, thinking we could go a seperate path than the game that walked before it. What did we get instead? SLow and stagnating game development, with he Original hero pool not done aftre three years, three years for LAN mode which you need to be online to play anyway, bare bones MM and no ladders/stats of any kind unless your a 5 man team(which you are better of playing inhouses anyway since the TMM rating has very little value). You also get very little additional or new content. In fact now that Dota 2 is out of beta, the game is progressing less and events like Diretide that happened in beta with less players gets canceled without a word. And yes they did promise it, last time I checked Annual meant once a year. Diretide was supposed to be an annual event. Guess that\u0027s done, but TF2 can get its 5th Halloween update despite much less concurrent players? What? It\u0027s also taking Valve MONTHS to port already established heroes from Dota 1. Riot can make a completely new one in 2 weeks. Ouch. Valve is sitting on their hands and making bad decisions faster bad decisions. The only decent thing they have done is catering to e-sports with tickets and Dota TV, but when it comes to playing the game rather than watching it, your in for some disappointment. Oh and the hiked up the ticket prices initially when Dota 2 TV were on average $2.99. Now your average ticket is $8 dollars or more with only the lower tier tournament being $3.99. If your not a diehard MOBA fan, honestly you\u0027re better off going to LoL, and I\u0027m saying this as a Dota fan(not Dota 2) and as a person who thinks LoL is the inferior game. Why? Because if you play MOBAs causally Riot gives you hats AND new content. Valve only gives you hats and disappointment and zero communication. Also, for what it\u0027s worth, Riot\u0027s hats are better anyway. Go figure. This game gets a six just for being good as a port of Dota, -4 for being under Valve\u0027s control. This game is going the way of CS and TF2. Ded. Which is a shame because CS was a really good competitive game.… ",

The only thing we have left is Icefrogs Balance patch. Valve doesnt communicate anymore, the bugfixing is so slow like never (fix 3 bugs and create 15 others) and we had 2 Heros in 8 Months (and we still need 10 to complete the pool). i dont really care for Diretide (or the greevling at christmas) but these 2 Funmods where relaxing after some tough normal matches. but the fact that Valve doesnt communicate and doesnt work on DotA 2 anymore is unaceptable! yes Valve has its own way to work on projects but this half assed we get now is just a big YOU in the face to the Community! DotA 2 is the MOST played game on Steam with more than 5 times the players the second place has. tl;dr i wont recommend playing now! this game doesnt deserve a 10/10 or a 05/10 score... it deserves a -10/10 score. i never did think that i would say this but: League of Legends as it is now is by far the superior game.… ",

It is clear that no Valve employee cares about Dota 2 at all, because there has been no expansion of gameplay features provided by Valve. Matchmaking is atrocious. It takes far too long to find a game and puts players of completely different skill levels in the same game. There is no leaver prevention, as one simply makes a new account to circumvent the quality protection features. Addition of game impacting content has slowed to the point where the last meaningful update occurred four months ago. Valve refuses to divulge any information of future developments, and bugs are left in the game for years. Valve refuses to communicate with the playerbase on any matter, while the regular content updates include micro transaction cosmetics and nothing more. There is no incentive to be competitive in this competitive game. Dota 2 is a good game if you are a professional Chinese Dota player and Gaben will personally donate money to you to play it, but otherwise it\u0027s not a special moba experience.… ",

The TF2 events always were fun, and i couldnt wait to return to Diretide. But nothing happened. No communication, no diretide. I and many others got angry and demanded atleast some communication towards the biggest playerbase on Steam. Just a little more then an hour ago they updated Dota2, with only cosmetics. Just a few cosmetics, while the playerbase is raging about the fact that there is no Diretide event. And jet no communication has been made. Valve, you have dissapointed me. In my eyes you were the best in communicating and making games software. But after this, i have lost all hope in Valve. In my eyes, you belong right down there with EA, Ubisoft and Activision.… ",

There are still missing heroes from the original dota (heroes that have not been ported yet), there are several missing options in the option tab, you have to edit some cfg to change them, game is poorly optimized (memory leaks that force you to restart the it after 1 single game), there are graphical artefacts caused by the engine, matchmaking is a joke (they explain how mmr works but that only shows how an 1500 mmr player end up in same team with a 3000 mmr player something that is completly wrong), when a hero spawn the game freeze, if you alt+tab the game in win xp and try to get back you end up with a blank screen and only way to get back ingame is to end task dota 2, some heroes are overpowered big time and in the last 2-3 patches nothing has been done to adress this problem, drop system is badly implemented trools, flamers, feeders get legendary and mythical items while decent and good players barely get a rare from time to time, 3 posible reports week is a bad joke for someone that play 5 games day because on average he will have to report 1 player game, mute system is badly implemented cause it cripples a team game cause the one muted is matched with unmuted players and he can\u0027t talk/answer to them, dispate the fact that the game has not implemented heroes from dota 2 valve works on cosmetics, extremely poor qualy hero graphic (abadon, omg extremely bad quality base graphic for this hero), no communication from devs part, devs refuse to listen comunity (take for example diretide 2013 there is a topic with more the 200 pages and no dev answered if there will be diretide 2013 or not, not that they answer to something), \"balance patches\" that don\u0027t balance anything but make some overpowered abilities even more stronger (aghanim buff for doom) and add useless things (aghanim for disruptor, disruptor is a support hero he will not get the farm for aghanim during an average game...). Those are the main reasons that make me score 2/10, it\u0027s so low because that\u0027s the score i gave to any game that is officialy released dispate the fact that it\u0027s in beta and has tones of problems.… ",

Each hero is very different, so there are almost a hundred different ways you can play, not even taking into consideration the item or skill builds on your hero. The map is gorgeous, the dialogue is pricelessly funny, and the time it takes to learn the game is well worth it. The game is very complicated (this is where reading the wiki comes in handy), but it\u0027s very fun with friends or even in a random game. It can be frustrating at first, but taking the time to learn tricks from playing, messing around, or watching competitive games (which are mind-blowing) makes the experience that much better. As for the plethora of negative reviews, many of those are non-credible due to the fact that lots of people raged about Valve not releasing some content on time. Valve is normally very good about things like that, and even without all the cosmetics-only updates, you get far more updates and additional content than you would from pretty much anybody else. After all, I\u0027m rating the game itself here and not the company, and Dota 2 gets a 10/10 from me.… ",

The main issues with dota 2 are mainly developer related. I have been playing dota for almost 2 years now and the community has been extremely vocal about the features and aspects they really want to see in the game, yet NOTHING has been implemented accompanied with absolutely no communication from valve or the dota 2 developers. For the past few months the main content of this game has been nothing but hats and cosmetic items, this wouldn\u0027t be an issue IF the game had the features it really needs but, they are not there and there is no sign of them ever being implemented. Now out of Beta, dota 2 Still has absolutely no competitive aspect for the general player, there is no ranked games no ladder no MMR system absolutely NOTHING, not only does this result in terrible match making but the game seems to become stale. This feature is an integral part of EVERY succesful competitive game at the moment yet valve chose to ignore it which is a massive mistake in my opinion. Additionally there are no ingame stats, and basically absolutely no reward for playing the game anymore. It seems as if valve have adopted the idea that hats and cosmetics will keep the community happy without improving the game. As a result of this most of the community has become complacent and annoyed especially with the recent situation of valve choosing to not implement a Halloween event that had been there in the past without notifying the community. I do believe Valve are falling short when it comes the the competitive aspect of DOTA and have turned it more into a fashion boutique. In the end if u are looking for a game to show off your items and have some casual fun then dota is the game for you otherwise i would suggest a game like League( As much as it upsets me to say that)… ",

The players are: Egotistic, ego centric, unsporting, aggressive, hostile, uncaring, mean, mistrusting, immature, callous, apathetic and incredibly pretentious while at every loss prompting everyone inside the current game to \"Report player X\" if someone on their team was even remotely new to the game or did any other action not sanctified by them, be it going in what lane you want, not purchasing courier/wards or simply just had an unlucky run/getting cross-classed. Along with being completely miserable to be around, they frequently never speak the language in the region you\u0027re playing and nowhere else is this more apparent when russian is spammed into the chat at all times on European zones from 3 different sources at once. And if people do know English, trolling is nothing short but assured from all directions to all teams. Second biggest problem with this game would be the elitist mindset that orbits anyone that has played this atrocious game for more than a couple of hours. Any behavior that breaks the typical dota 2\u0027s hardcore player routine of buying tango, healing salve and iron branches, perhaps with some boots of speed if they\u0027re feeling adventurous will result in a wave of F-bombs, intentional feeding, votes of surrender, spam prompts to report player X and disconnecting users as far as the eye can see. I even had cases where players left the game because some guy forgot to buy a courier at the start of the game. And that\u0027s me overlooking the fact that killstealing off your TEAMMATES is considered average behavior/a common tactic. In LoL, you can even report people for \"being unskilled\". As in, anyone. Even if they\u0027re level 1.To put it bluntly, MOBA\u0027s like dota 2 give out a special kind of disgusting behavior that makes me feel physically ill for very good reasons. Coming close to problem number 2 is the third epic fail problem of this game. The match-making in Dota 2. Broken, poorly thought through and executed horribly. You are prompted to select a variety of regions before initiating the match-making system and the more regions you have selected, the less waiting time.. Which begs the question, what is the point with the regional system if you\u0027re just gonna encourage people to sign up for all regions? The end result will be that nobody sticking to their geographical zones and not only causes frustration in the form of people trying to communicate and chat with eachother in the chat as described above but also disallows any kind of vocal text tactical communication since everyone does not speak the same language. In all honestly, this game is overloaded with issues just like this and I would be able to overlook this particular embarassing design-flop if it wasn\u0027t for the actual hard functionality of the MM as well being broken. The scenario on where 4-5 organized people in a group, all sitting in ventrilo/teamspeak while packing thousands of hours in Dota 2 each have a very likely possibility to be \"teamed\" up against new players with less than 10 hours with no complaints from the match-making system (even if there is a very large queue) throws out any chance of that. This happens particulary often if you decide to try the game out with a friend or two which leaves me with yet another question: The purpose of match-making was to find equally skilled opponents. So why is this even remotely possible? Team-based games with a mandatory MM are supposed to be fair. Not Tyrannosaurus rex VS a duckling. I\u0027m reluctant to say that Dota 2 even has a match-making at all once you look at all the facts. Even with all these problems, I could actually see myself overlooking them at a certain time during a year due to the sheer amount of possible combinations in this game with heroes \u0026 items and the addictive quality the game has if it wasn\u0027t for all the other flaws. The commitment to play DotA MOBA\u0027s however, is the biggest flaw of them all that this game inhibits. It changes whoever plays the game as a person. For the worse. Why? Because the game inhibits \"addictive\" qualities similar with that of jamming needles full with endorphin into your spine every half hour. It\u0027s painful, it hurts your emotional stability, it hurts you as a person and it hurts the people around you and for what? A small kick of pleasure/self satisfaction as you managed to win a fundamentally unbalanced game with an emphasis on gank above all else due to chance or otherwise pre-meditated \"pubstomping\"? Not worth it in so many ways since at the end of the day, Dota 2 will never be fully balanced because Valve will be split between tournament-balances and casual or the \"normal\" version of the game while repeatedly adding more and more content in the form of heroes. I could keep on going with design flop after design flop but at the end of the day, this game is not worth anyone\u0027s time or dedication.… ",

Now I\u0027ve had some bad experience with these type of players even though I do not wish to generalize but when even the language preference gets ignored when you queue up for a game and you get a game full of russians where only 2 of them speak english. In my experience, russians are the worst players to have in your team. I am not generalizing here, I know there are exceptions, there are always exceptions but almost everytime I had a russian in my team he didn\u0027t even speak english or he didn\u0027t even try to communicate with his own team besides cursing and I only wish that I won\u0027t deal with these kind of players in my future games but it\u0027s inevitable since Russia is the prime demographic for dota2 by population. -The community is toxic, no matter what you, no matter how you do it, the community will always be toxic. It\u0027s a competitive game, it\u0027s completely normal, but man, I\u0027ve encountered some type of players that are the worst human beings in this world. Now I\u0027m speaking about cursing your own teammates or stuff like that, when you try and help someone, or teach them a lesson that apparently they don\u0027t know, their ego inflates so much that he will no longer be a part of your team. Most of them will either leave, feed intentionally by walking right into the enemy and staying there until they kill him or just doing things that generally helps the enemy team more than it helps you (a.k.a. sending the courier into the enemy lines so it will die therefore we cannot transport items and the enemy team earns a bounty for killing our courier, OR even using special items like the force staff to push you into the enemy etc, the list is way too long). Meanwhile there ARE indeed consequences, leaving puts you into low priority for X ammount of time based on your total abandons or abandon spree and reporting players but that doesn\u0027t seem to be enough. -The reporting system is a spam and that\u0027s it. If someone does not like you, they\u0027ll report you for whatever reason. I don\u0027t know how the reporting system works but sometimes I get into low priority for nothing, literally nothing or nothing that I know about. Do people actually check the replay for every report submission sent? Because that would be way too hard for the devs to do considering it\u0027s players number and the devs number and/or admins. -The matchmaking is a forced 50%. This means that if you win 9 games in a row, you will lose 9 games in a row and not in the same way. For example today you win 4 times and lose 5 times, tomorrow you\u0027ll lose 3 more times and so on until your win/lose ratio ends up to a roughly 50%. This thing means nothing whatsoever. People who are playing competitive games usually have hopes or are actively practicing games so they could step in the pro scene. Now the way other games in this genre are doing is by adding a ranking system bronze, silver, diamond, cheese, bacon whatever etc that a player can be proud of and show to the team he wishes to enter or to know his current status as a player compared to others. What does the 50% win ratio prove? Absolutely nothing, you\u0027re the same as the other players, it doesn\u0027t matter that you stack with other players and you\u0027re on skype or whatever, you\u0027ll eventually end up with players better than you that will kick you back down and down from the very beggining. The matchmaking should add players of your current skill level so the match would be even. Most games I get are usually one sided stomps that don\u0027t even get to see the 30 minutes mark of the game, which is considered a very important part of the game since there are actually heroes that are good only after that 30 minute mark, also known as hard-carries. -This game used to have weekly updates with old heroes that needed to be ported into the game, cosmetics so the developers can actually earn money and general gameplay updates and bugfixes. They also used to make events during the obvious holidays of the year, well, most of the time. A year ago DotA2 had an event called Diretide during the Halloween that had a new gamemode added to the game that was Halloween inspired, The Greeviling for the christmas and so on and so forth, but this year, it seems like that has changed. DotA 2 didn\u0027t get any Halloween inspired event at all and in the past 3 months, the game had a single patch besides cosmetics patch. I am no longer buying cosmetics from the store until they decide to work on the game.… ",

Its great and yeah,MOSTLY valve did a great job in the past. But they screwed it over this time. Reading all of these give Diretide posts? It might be a bit irritating for \"outsiders\" but in fact a very viable,alive game with one of the strongest gaming communities ever was bought by valve. In the begining they communicated and had visible progress,I think I can say everyone in the community was glad they did their job that well. But after releasing the game,making it the biggest game on steam and such... there was nothing. There still is nothing. Silence,no updates. Heroes were added in like weekly back in the beta days,there are still A LOT of heroes missing from old DotA 1 and well... no overall progress for months. But it was okay,the people believed in something cool for Diretide (the Halloween event held last year),it was like everyone was saying: \"It\u0027s okay you don\u0027t have the heroes just give us something new to play\". NOTHING. Not even a \"sorry we cant do it this year\" nor bug fixes (this is another pretty big problem,there are about 1000 KNOWN BUGS not being fixed... well,since beta. So everyone was waiting for this update,because hey we didn\u0027t get anything else in the near past. Instead of releasing the halloween update they release cosmetic items (slang: hats) to buy. You know there are people refreshing a community driven page every 30seconds to know if there is a really needed update to a game that just went out of beta. There is none. Even sader there is no communication,there is no feel of improvement. There is just more stuff to spend your hard earned money on. And this is why all the people are mad and why this is absolutely legitimate. BECAUSE IT IS OUR (THE CUSTOMERS (its f2p,but the majority of this community spent money in good will)) way to show our disagreement IN HOPE TO CHANGE VALVES BEHAVIOUR IN THE FUTURE. Again this is not about DotA in general,this is about the games treatment by valve. they are literally killing their own child. I hope this is strong enough to beware em… ",

Not only is the development side of valve lackluster, but, with the recent community aspirations for the annual \u0027diretide\u0027 event, Valve has now not only ignored the celebratory season, but what is really saddening is their community management/responsiveness when it comes to such events in general. Oh, guess what? We got another hat update today. We were quite openly given the middle finger from Valve.

You don\u0027t know how hard it can be to implement these kind of things, and you certainly don\u0027t fully understand the situation. Just wait a little and we will learn all about the reasons DireTide isn\u0027t out yet.… ",

I revert my 9/10 score to a 1/10 due to a change of opinion about the game\u0027s developers. More than 4 months of waiting for any actual content that aren\u0027t cosmetic items and the community got nothing. On November 1, Valve chose to update the game with more cosmetic items instead of giving the community the highly anticipated ANNUAL Halloween Dota2 event \"Diretide\", a huge slap to the face of their fans who were waiting for any sort of actual content. The game was in beta for more than 2 years and they still couldn\u0027t port all the Dota 1 heroes because they choose to shove as much cosmetic items down their costumers\u0027 throats instead of working on actual game content, better matchmaking, or bug fixes. Meanwhile, Valve apologists still defend this company\u0027s terrible practices of keeping the community in the dark and berate people who are angered by Valve\u0027s practices. I bet these same people would shove a horse\u0027s penis up their anuses if Valve ordered them to do it, not surprising too because Gabe and the majority of the community are Bronies and they\u0027d love nothing more than getting screwed by ponies. 1/10 Bad developers, terrible community, dead game.… ",

    "comments": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view. Great game but bad developer.no communication between valve and dota 2 communities.MORE HATS DEAD GAME Never In my entire life have I witnessed a worse community revolving around a video-game than the one that is to be found in Dota 2. The players are: Egotistic, ego centric, unsporting, aggressive, hostile, uncaring, mean, mistrusting, immature, callous, apathetic and incredibly pretentious while at every loss prompting everyone inside the current game to \"Report player X\" if someone on their team was even remotely new to the game or did any other action not sanctified by them, be it going in what lane you want, not purchasing courier/wards or simply just had an unlucky run/getting cross-classed. Along with being completely miserable to be around, they frequently never speak the language in the region you\u0027re playing and nowhere else is this more apparent when russian is spammed into the chat at all times on European zones from 3 different sources at once. And if people do know English, trolling is nothing short but assured from all directions to all teams. Second biggest problem with this game would be the elitist mindset that orbits anyone that has played this atrocious game for more than a couple of hours. Any behavior that breaks the typical dota 2\u0027s hardcore player routine of buying tango, healing salve and iron branches, perhaps with some boots of speed if they\u0027re feeling adventurous will result in a wave of F-bombs, intentional feeding, votes of surrender, spam prompts to report player X and disconnecting users as far as the eye can see. I even had cases where players left the game because some guy forgot to buy a courier at the start of the game. And that\u0027s me overlooking the fact that killstealing off your TEAMMATES is considered average behavior/a common tactic. In LoL, you can even report people for \"being unskilled\". As in, anyone. Even if they\u0027re level 1.To put it bluntly, MOBA\u0027s like dota 2 give out a special kind of disgusting behavior that makes me feel physically ill for very good reasons. Coming close to problem number 2 is the third epic fail problem of this game. The match-making in Dota 2. Broken, poorly thought through and executed horribly. You are prompted to select a variety of regions before initiating the match-making system and the more regions you have selected, the less waiting time.. Which begs the question, what is the point with the regional system if you\u0027re just gonna encourage people to sign up for all regions? The end result will be that nobody sticking to their geographical zones and not only causes frustration in the form of people trying to communicate and chat with eachother in the chat as described above but also disallows any kind of vocal text tactical communication since everyone does not speak the same language. In all honestly, this game is overloaded with issues just like this and I would be able to overlook this particular embarassing design-flop if it wasn\u0027t for the actual hard functionality of the MM as well being broken. The scenario on where 4-5 organized people in a group, all sitting in ventrilo/teamspeak while packing thousands of hours in Dota 2 each have a very likely possibility to be \"teamed\" up against new players with less than 10 hours with no complaints from the match-making system (even if there is a very large queue) throws out any chance of that. This happens particulary often if you decide to try the game out with a friend or two which leaves me with yet another question: The purpose of match-making was to find equally skilled opponents. So why is this even remotely possible? Team-based games with a mandatory MM are supposed to be fair. Not Tyrannosaurus rex VS a duckling. I\u0027m reluctant to say that Dota 2 even has a match-making at all once you look at all the facts.… ",

You can spend hours endlessly playing and there\u0027s so much to learn from the pro scene. I love watching Dota 2 matches almost as much as I do playing them!

At the beginning, you might think that there are OP characters, however, there are counters so everything. Anyone is OP if they are fed by someone, so that\u0027s not a valid reason to mark the game down. The community in this game is questionable, as you can get some really nice players and some really insulting individuals, which can slightly ruin the game, however, that\u0027s not the games fault, it\u0027s the peoples.… ",

Disgruntled players starded spamming twitch chat with emotes, which eventually changed to people losing on purpose in-game to \"call Valve\u0027s attention\" and finally to defacing Wikipedia articles and raiding the game Metascore. Again, because there was no holiday event, which by the way, lots of people complained last year because it was imbalanced and was delaying the release of new heroes. But remember, the issue is not about the event (or lack of it) but about \"Valve\u0027s disrepect and lack of communication for the community\" about a event which people expected to happen thought it was never officially announced or hinted in any way.\" -Nerf NOW!!… ",

Noone is checking those reports. YOu can be reported for being black or for wearing glasses and believe me: YOU WILL. Valve doesnt talk with its playerbase at all, the UI sucks big time as well as the game interface nothing gets changed, you buy tournament tickets ingame: they lack casters, the casters audio lags so hard its unwatchable, very bad matchmaking that couples a very bad player with a very good player so we have a balanced team, right? RIGHT???? No ladder, no MMR, no feeling of progression. Artwork is getting up though by the weekly (very often more than once a week) Hat patches valve is making money from. I will never buy another steam game nor put any kind of dollar into this platform after Rome 2 and DotA 2. Thank you fat lord Gaben.

Over the progression of the game, prices continuously increase and the community fanbase continuously worsens. There is no way of setting a public, free room and instead you are thrown into one of their preset matchmaking queues. The way around this is through third party match clients such as the IXDL. Even though it is so popular Valve frantically prances around in its ignorance of implementing such a crucial system. The gameplay is average in the current battleground of MOBA games while the graphics are generally better. Overall I am just playing this game to make some money. Nothing more. IGN: 322.Solo… ",

There is ABSOLUTELY 0 communication between the developers and the community. There are currently two forum in which you have to post if you want to discuss about dota: one is the developer forum and one is the old wc3 dota forum. The developer forum is meant ONLY for bugs in DOTA2, the wc3 forum is instead for balance discussion. If you post for balance in the dev forum they send you to the wc3 forum. Do you know what is the issue with this? THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO VALVE DEVELOPER IN THE WC3 FORUM. Why Valve is confusing the community this way? The wc3 forum is clearly inappropriate to hold a discussion about dota 2. It\u0027s as if the official League of Legends forum was inside the Heroes of Newerth forum, there is no reason to split this way the people who like the game. 99.999% of the answers you get from the wc3 forum are from other community members. That is right, there is currently no one WORKING on dota 2 answering your question. Icefrog the person who is balancing the game hasn\u0027t answered or talked to the community in the last 2 or three years. Valve developers are even worse. Forget about knowing if there will be a patch soon, NONE OF THE 300 VALVE DEVELOPERS WILL ANSWER TO THIS SIMPLE QUESTION, they prefer to keep their fan waiting for hours as if this wouldn\u0027t make them angry. In other Dota like games the developers always say that the community must be keep clean from the toxicity. In DOTA2 I say that the developers are the most TOXIC part of the game.… ",

It\u0027s about the lack of communication from Valve and the complete lack of respect towards the very same community that made The Internationals and all the hype around them possible. Dota 2 is an unfinished product with a bug list longer than a Fall Out Boy song title (i\u0027m talking 1000+ entries), with quite a few heroes not yet added and a broken matchmaking. And when I say broken, I really do mean it. So with all these things around to do/fix, what does Valve do? Right, they go out of their way to release cosmetic items, sometimes twice a week. I\u0027m not saying they are actively working on them, they are just allowing community-made items into the game. I\u0027m not saying that Valve are a money-grabbing company that cares not for their players/customers either it\u0027s them who are saying this by not communicating about the development progress at all. All we can see lately are new hats, cosmetics and whatnot. You know what? I\u0027m changing my score to 1, just for the effort, but it really have backfired on them. Time to wake the f up for without us you ain\u0027t nothing.… ",

The players are: Egotistic, ego centric, unsporting, aggressive, hostile, uncaring, mean, mistrusting, immature, callous, apathetic and incredibly pretentious while at every loss prompting everyonei am really really disappointed with my team right now Never In my entire life have I witnessed a worse community revolving around a video-game than the one that is to be found in Dota 2. The players are: Egotistic, ego centric, unsporting, aggressive, hostile, uncaring, mean, mistrusting, immature, callous, apathetic and incredibly pretentious while at every loss prompting everyone inside the current game to \"Report player X\" if someone on their team was even remotely new to the game or did any other action not sanctified by them, be it going in what lane you want, not purchasing courier/wards or simply just had an unlucky run/getting cross-classed. Along with being completely miserable to be around, they frequently never speak the language in the region you\u0027re playing and nowhere else is this more apparent when russian is spammed into the chat at all times on European zones from 3 different sources at once. And if people do know English, trolling is nothing short but assured from all directions to all teams. Second biggest problem with this game would be the elitist mindset that orbits anyone that has played this atrocious game for more than a couple of hours. Any behavior that breaks the typical dota 2\u0027s hardcore player routine of buying tango, healing salve and iron branches, perhaps with some boots of speed if they\u0027re feeling adventurous will result in a wave of F-bombs, intentional feeding, votes of surrender, spam prompts to report player X and disconnecting users as far as the eye can see. I even had cases where players left the game because some guy forgot to buy a courier at the start of the game. And that\u0027s me overlooking the fact that killstealing off your TEAMMATES is considered average behavior/a common tactic. In LoL, you can even report people for \"being unskilled\". As in, anyone. Even if they\u0027re level 1.To put it bluntly, MOBA\u0027s like dota 2 give out a special kind of disgusting behavior that makes me feel physically ill for very good reasons. Coming close to problem number 2 is the third epic fail problem of this game. The match-making in Dota 2. Broken, poorly thought through and executed horribly. You are prompted to select a variety of regions before initiating the match-making system and the more regions you have selected, the less waiting time.. Which begs the question, what is the point with the regional system if you\u0027re just gonna encourage people to sign up for all regions? The end result will be that nobody sticking to their geographical zones and not only causes frustration in the form of people trying to communicate and chat with eachother in the chat as described above but also disallows any kind of vocal text tactical communication since everyone does not speak the same language. In all honestly, this game is overloaded with issues just like this and I would be able to overlook this particular embarassing design-flop if it wasn\u0027t for the actual hard functionality of the MM as well being broken. The scenario on where 4-5 organized people in a group, all sitting in ventrilo/teamspeak while packing thousands of hours in Dota 2 each have a very likely possibility to be \"teamed\" up against new players with less than 10 hours with no complaints from the match-making system (even if there is a very large queue) throws out any chance of that. This happens particulary often if you decide to try the game out with a friend or two which leaves me with yet another question: The purpose of match-making was to find equally skilled opponents. So why is this even remotely possible? Team-based games with a mandatory MM are supposed to be fair. Not Tyrannosaurus rex VS a duckling. I\u0027m reluctant to say that Dota 2 even has a match-making at all once you look at all the facts. Even with all these problems, I could actually see myself overlooking them at a certain time during a year due to the sheer amount of possible combinations in this game with heroes \u0026 items and the addictive quality the game has if it wasn\u0027t for all the other flaws. The commitment to play DotA MOBA\u0027s however, is the biggest flaw of them all that this game inhibits. It changes whoever plays the game as a person. For the worse. Why? Because the game inhibits \"addictive\" qualities similar with that of jamming needles full with endorphin into your spine every half hour. It\u0027s painful, it hurts your emotional stability, it hurts you as a person and it hurts the people around you and for what? A small kick of pleasure/self satisfaction as you managed to win a fundamentally unbalanced game with an emphasis on gank above all else due to chance or otherwise pre-meditated \"pubstomping\"? Not worth it in so many ways since at the end of the day, Dota 2 will never be fully balanced because Valve will be split between tournament-balances and casual or the \"normal\" version of the game while repeatedly adding more and more content in the form of heroes. I could keep on going with design flop after design flop but at the end of the day,… ",

This is embarrassing considering it has been 3 months since the last hero was added. - Dysfunctional punishment system. No in-game moderators or tribunals that can assist in rooting out the \u0027rotten apples\u0027 of the community. - Because of the nature of the Matchmaking System, you can forget about Solo-queuing and having a good time. Unless you play with friends, at certain levels, you will only have a terrible gaming experience, including lots of flaming and blaming. Once again I say this as someone who has been playing the game for 7 years. Unfortunately, these negatives drag the game so far downwards that I do not even enjoy playing it anymore. However if Valve can fix these issues, this game will become unrivaled. Good luck to Valve, because thus far I am extremely disappointed.… ",

The matchmaking may pair you with non english speakers sometimes, but Valve has implemented features to circumvent this problem such as the ability to ping locations on map and a customizable chat wheel that will automatically translate common sayings into the end users chosen language. 90% of the negative reviews are just made recently by flamers who are upset about not having the halloween event in the game this year (Diretide for those of you who don\u0027t know.) Go with the critics on this game as most of the negative comments have no actual criticism of the game or developer and the game is absolutely excellent.… ",

I love the tourneys, comics, broadcasters, chickcasters and everything about the game. What I hate: Valve Corporation, and I don\u0027t want you to wait 8 years to realise this. So read on. 1. Valve is more interested in selling you cosmetic items and maintaining the Dota 2 economy than the actual game itself. 2. Valve has selective hearing when it comes to the Dota 2 community which is based upon the same community that build WCIII DOTA in the first place. 3. Valve does not have a habit of keeping Dota 2 players abreast with the latest developments. At the time of writing (Nov 6, 2013), the last Dota 2 blog post was on September 19. 4. Valve hosts one of the most lucrative tournaments and supports smaller tournaments, but they can\u0027t get this right Team Logos and Team Banners. Players have been complaining about this for nearly a year. Shouldn\u0027t Valve be trying to help teams? Aren\u0027t they the key to a robust competitive scene? 5. Valve has prostituted the beloved Icefrog the man that single-handedly made ARTS/MOBA what it is today. Icefrog no longer communicates with the community. That is sad. 6. Valve implemented a terrible tutorial system that doesn\u0027t help me bring new players into the game. They should take a page out of LoL. 7. Valve doesn\u0027t see a need in improving the MMR/report system, or are hiring really stupid people to do it. They should take a page out of LoL. 8. Valve somehow thinks that a ladder system is not important. This means that there are times that my five man stack meets absolutely new players. I don\u0027t think they are going to play Dota 2 long if they keep getting stomped. 9. Valve has no qualms going back on its word. They said that Diretide is an annual event. They lied. No apologies, even for those who have spent a lot of money on their product. That sucks. That is UNPROFESSIONAL. Alright would-be Dota 2 players. You have been warned. Now, if you\u0027ll excuse me, I\u0027m going to click on the FIND MATCH button.… ",

Solution-\u003e be polite sharpen your skills be a good player and ask other people you played with (that you consider good in any meaning of the term) to play again with you. In conclusion be a good gamer enjoy a good experience or be a dick and enjoy a dick growing up your ass. MUAHAHAHAHA Pointless to say that every team PvP community is toxic as and mobas are hella elitist so deal with it you will get insulted where you go, accept that or take this quote made by a LoL player: cry me a river you lil and put a ward on it. To Valve: Yes you my dear valve... who took my favorite game to make it a chicken that poops golden eggs. Stop making hats and make some content or you will die of thirst to better teams, i have a free keys to open the chests of your minds: good games MAKE MONEY, good teams developing good games MAKES MORE MONEY, listening to your community to improve your game with a good team MAKES EVEN MORE MONEY. The game is really good now, the question is: are you good enough to make the KING of mobas stay in his throne? time will tell us. PD: DIRETIDE SUCKS GET OVER IT FREE HAT HUNTERS… ",

If you have a few friends looking for a team game to play this is a great one without a doubt. Be warnedDota 2 is a fantastic MOBA that is based off of the original Dota 1 from the WC3 era. The game is immensely complex in all of its mechanics but very simple to understand. As you can guess this results in a massive learning curve and adheres to \"easy to understand, difficult to master\". If you have a few friends looking for a team game to play this is a great one without a doubt. Be warned that you will get frustrated at times with your team mates, and if you solo que you risk being put on teams with those who may not speak the same language. Queing on US East servers does NOT guarantee and english speaking team, but honestly, that is the biggest issue. Otherwise, the game is flawless in execution. All heroes are immediately available, there is a tutorial mode for new players, and the ability to create your own private matches if you have a large group of friends to play your own games. These matches can also be changed to include \u0027cheats\u0027 and have zero cool down on abilities which makes for some hilarious games with your friends. Generally, Dota 2 is hugely addictive, and is a ton of fun! Particularly when you get into the high skill heroes and when you learn the \u0027juke spots\u0027. There is a ton of material on youtube to help you learn and to up your game. I personally have logged well over a 1000 hours as have many of my friends. Don\u0027t be fooled though, this may share similarities to HoN or LoL but it is NOT the same.… ",

Instead all you get is - original DOTA with a new coat of paint - questionable art direction - EXTREMELY SLOW gameplay and matches - NO RANKING SYSTEM - a community that is nothing but trolls that will literally trap you in the environment to troll you - A TERRIBLE report system that simply counts the number of reports against a player and eventually punishes them in some minor way for 5 minutes - A complete lack of literally ANY originality, no new ideas, systems, modes, maps or anything else folks! - A god awful tutorial that does nothing to go into the much more important and deeper mechanics of the game - A lack of ANY WAY to concede the match so 9/10 games you\u0027ll end up sitting in your base for 10 minutes watching the enemy very slowly get closer. In short, as I previously mentioned, DOTA 2 is nothing more than a redone version of it\u0027s original with nothing to offer and certainly no reason to keep going back to play it unless you\u0027re a troll. If you want a decent MOBA game and LoL is too easy, shallow and casual for you then I HIGHLY recommend you try out \"Heroes of Newerth\" the best, most complicated, competitive, skillful and unique of the MOBA genre with a lot more to offer than this!… ",

After the initial excitement at the game, over the last 22 months I have become increasingly frustrated by Valve\u0027s arrogant attitude towards the playing community, which seems to have become worse since the official release earlier this year. My frustrations and objections are too numerous to explain in full here, but the final straw [so to speak] was the Diretide no-show this Halloween, and the rumoured cancellation of The Greeviling. I had been looking forward to Diretide for the last two months, counting down the days (yeah, sad, I know). But what angered me more than anything was the way Valve completely disregarded the Dota 2 fans by not even having the courtesy firstly to inform them of this high-handed decision and secondly not even bother to answer their questions on this matter. Shame on you, Valve! Such disregard for the fans isn\u0027t really a good idea. As a DotA player, I would \u0027ring the changes\u0027 by playing games of Warcraft III with family and friends. (DotA is fun, don\u0027t get me wrong, but running down the same lanes all the time with the same purpose can become just a little tedious) and so having other game modes was fun. When Valve promised annual evens such as Diretide and The Greeviling, this opened up the opportunity for those players who wanted something a little different to engage in these games. There were some Dota 2 players who objected to these games, but, hey guys, they were alternatives, not compulsory! Well, I never trust those who go back on their promises, so Valve, you get a big fat zero for your game and your dereliction of duty to your fan base.… ",

Cons - The matchmaking system must be fixed.You can have 1 hour of gameplay and suddenly end up with 2 or 3 pros on the other team which obviously isn\u0027t fair. - Even though you choose to play in european servers there are bunch of Russians (not racist) who don\u0027t speak English .Those who do speak English tend to be offensive against everyone and refuse to cooperate. - Though the buy-able cosmetics do not give any advantage to the player,it\u0027s a big problem for other players who just don\u0027t care about them and don\u0027t want them.That\u0027s because they have to download 7gbs of useless models.I\u0027m pretty sure that the game itself isn\u0027t even 5gb. Tip Find some people to play with if you\u0027re not patient.Otherwise you\u0027ll be wasting your time.… ",

Then, the nightmare started, they yelled on me, they called me a noob, they insulted, reported, I was in low priority a lot of times but guess whatwhat, I didn’t cry like some of the losers I saw here, I knew I was a noob, sometimes I attacked heros being attacked by creeps at the same time early game (and that caused death), teammated said to me “stay close to towers and you will be fine” I watched playes that owned others and screenshoted their builds to try to understand how it’s done, and I deserve it I felt bad because it was a hard game but when I saw the international that confirmed my desire, I wanted to LEARN that freaking hard and amazing game, the fact that I saw a giant roster of heros, a lot of ways to build a hero, a lot of combinations, wow!, I knew I wasn’t playing a little thing. THAT motivated me to improve. Because I have internet, instead (and not knowing at all) I decided to READ heros descriptions and LEARN I watched videos, viewed builds/guides (if you played a MMORPG you know what Im talking) is not a big thing, just a little learning, then, something magic happened, I started to improve, I started to buy courier and the team won, and I FEEL GOOD. For the first time in a single game I felt I learnt a very hard thing, to communicate English properly, to teamfight, to PLACE WARDS, but most of all to LEARN. A lot of months have passed since the greeviling, and I felt a high income of new players, that was good, new people playing, its ok if you have a nice tutorial, not everybody can have the same passion about hard video games like me to search and learn, so most of the people will get bored and abandon the game before extracting its potential to be super fun, matchmaking take a lot of minutes, sometimes you could had waited like 20 minutes for a single match? Like if you wanted to play a match, you can play one on your mind while you wait. That’s ok, I thought there isn’t a lot of players with my number of wins/skill level (at that point I knew game basics, ward, courier, but not deward, dust/sentry when necessary yet) that allowed me to play something tolerable. The nightmare of being yelled cause was my fault (actually it was) that team lose, but another worse nightmare started now… Actually the matchmaking system will make you hate this game, not even be able to want to learn, finding a match takes a lot less, but I get matchmaked with people that doesn’t have 50 wins (and I have around 900) if Valve wanted cooperative learning Valve failed (until now) because we have a bad tutorial, we actually have like 5 stages of tutorial (yea, long and tedious) but still don’t talk about the philosophy of the game! I still don’t see to tell the new people that if you pick a support and you don’t buy wards/courier you will increase to lose since minute 00:00, same for wards, same for sentry/dust. So playing with these people is like talking in another language, they pick venomancer/lina cause are cute and they got bored of play a drow/ursa and you tell them to buy courier, they say “buy it yourself, you are mid, you buy, I don’t have money” then you get muted for being a noob and know how to play the game and telling them that we will lose if you don’t buy anything for the team, only 1 newbie with no desire to learn in team and you are enjoy 30-45 minute sitting back in your sit and get confortable, because that will be a looooong ride to sure lose and wasting your time, why team game if tutorial don’t tell you that you are a mere piece of a cog and not the superman or a nice frager that will save the team being a support and say at the end of the game. \"Omfg I’m 19-15-3 report the noobs, they didn’t killed a single anon Lina around 80 wins, 2013 (ofc no ward/courier, and taking mid). If you never played MOBA’s or don’t have a real interest to LEARN the game just don’t play it, you will end hating the game at the first week, you need to wait until they fix the matchmaking system and above all, a GOOD and not tedious, long tutorial that encourages people to LEARN, not giving all the food in a dish to their mouths like a freaking baby, I know most of us americlaps, want a easy game, and start fragging right away and feel like a pro at the first week, people, this aint team fortress 2 or counter strike, is a hard ass game and you will suck at start no matter what, you gamer powers that no one cares but you will fail here at start, but the only thing that will not fail is a desire to LEARN with that Valve, with that, you will achieve a masterpiece, until that, this game is in pub matchmaking, just fun when u play with friends (full party or at least 3) for now, is only a troll matchmaking and tutorial.… ",

They\u0027re both massively different games, but DOTA features several additional layers of complexity such as denying, jungle stacking, couriers, and buybacks. They give the game a completely different flow and provide several different items to strategize on. The gameplay is great, lots of different heroes with their own niches, and tons of items that each have something that sets them apart. The graphics are wonderful, with rich colors and detailed models across the map. And the sound is also pretty good, they have a system that plays different music based on your context. For example if you are in combat, it will play intense music etc. The reason I\u0027m giving it 8 stars is because it\u0027s hard to see your progression. There is no ranking system for those who matchmake solo. Because of this, it\u0027s hard to see if you are improving, and how much if you are. There are crude divisions, \"normal\", \"high\", and \"very high\", but they are hard to find and the statistics for the divisions are also not disclosed. I have no idea what\u0027s up with the current rating though, this game certainly deserves more than 4 stars.… ",

The learning curve is high, there are almost 100 heroes, with 4 or more spells each, and a ton of items (some build into others too!). It is a game you will be bad at for a while, but the learning experience is a good time as well. There is a sense of accomplishment in this game that I haven\u0027t had in others. This game will take time to learn, but if you are going to spend time gaming my advice would be to put some into this. The professional scene is also a great part of this game, and will teach you a lot as well. Overall, Dota 2 is my favorite game of all time, and I truly believe that it is the best PC game out there. Give it a try, you won\u0027t be sorry (for that long).… ",

Valve\u0027s matchmaking really does a stellar job of (most of the time) matching you with other players of a somewhat similar skill level. 500 hours is a lot, but... it\u0027s also not. And I expect to put in 5,000 more. Also, did I mention it\u0027s free? And not free like, \"Hey, here\u0027s a demo version!\" or even free like \"Yeah, you can play some, but give us money to buy more characters or powerups!\" I mean like,actually, totally free. The only things that money will buy you is cosmetics (cosmetics which also drop randomly at the end of almost every game.) So think of the money I\u0027ve saved putting 500 hours into a free game, instead of spending $5-$60 per 50 hour game? yeah, DO THE MATH! Worth. 10/10 would f2p again!… ",

IncreasingDota 2 is certainly a very interesting game for it\u0027s genre, with the major attraction being that you get pretty much all of the content up-front, free of charge. Whilst you may purchase an advantage in earning points for your in-game profile via the use of \u0027Battle Point Boosters\u0027, this cannot be looked at as a form of \u0027pay to win\u0027, as all the points do is increase your level. Increasing your profile level gives you both a random item and the ability to find even rarer items (Not to mention the bragging rights that come with such.), It should be noted that no item in Dota 2 gives you an advantage, or disadvantage during actual game-play. This makes it one of the more worth-while free to play games out there. On the other hand, Dota 2 has a very steep learning curve, and some may be turned away from the challenge of learning how to play. The genre of this game itself is a very small one, and this has led to a lot of confused newbies to the game. A tutorial was added into the game to help the player learn, but doesn\u0027t necessarily go into enough detail for some. To sum it up, Dota 2 is a free to play game that manages to steer clear of the ever-dreaded \u0027pay to win\u0027 issue we quite often come across in other free games. However, the game comes with a very steep learning curve that requires you to really get into the game and learn in your own way through trial and error. Dota 2 receives a 6/10 from me. It\u0027s not bad for a free to play game, but it\u0027s not the shiniest penny out there, either.… ",

Some people may talk about a toxic community, and it\u0027s true that you can meet your fair share of but Valve has really done their best to remedy this their report/commend system works wonders, and you can easily mute any player you choose with the click of a button. It may take a little getting used to after playing other similar games, but those who give this game a proper shot will find it to have depth and strategy beyond that of its kin. Truly addictive and a blast to play with friends, this game is one of the best I\u0027ve ever played.… ",

However, some parts of the developer\u0027s work is a little bit confusing, and perhaps even downright disappointing. Valve has, for a long time, been a community friendly company, at least very much above the average. So when updates come for months at a time and offer only hats, when proper game mechanics updates are promised more regularly, and seemingly trivial bugs aren\u0027t fixed, the frustration is quick to set in. All in all, a real great game to play with a couple friends regularly. The cosmetics are a very awesome addition to the game, and are usually very fitting, and really cool, but now and again a couple questionables get in. When Icefrog updates heroes and their abilities, there\u0027s always a very interesting change that changes the game substantially, which once again just adds to the replayability. I highly recommend this game, but only if you have a few hundred hours you can dedicate to just learning game mechanics, hero\u0027s abilities, and the map. It will seriously take that long.… ",

If you are hardcore there is plenty to see and enjoy. If you just like to see people win money there are casters that will make you piss your pants. In DotA you will encounter some flame yes, but there are moments in this game that bring such a smile to your face they will last a lifetime. If you don\u0027t play DotA you\u0027re cheating yourself out of an experience of a lifetime.… ",

The biggest drawback of dota is probably the steep learning curve, but don\u0027t let that scare you away, start playing it, you won\u0027t regret it. It\u0027s literally the best time I\u0027ve had with online gaming in my entire life, and I met some great people along the way. (and I learned some Russian)… ",

But in light of the intentional score sabotage campaign by legions of petulant children, I figure I should do my part to bring it back up to where it belongs. Let\u0027s get one thing out of the way from the start: the game is difficult. Mechanically, there are more challenging games. But you\u0027ll be hard pressed to find a game that taxes situational awareness and decision making more than DOTA. Even after almost 700 hours with the game, I still make many blunders in judgement per game. Watching the streams of notable community members who have dumped thousands of hours into this game and its predecessor and you\u0027ll see the same thing. They say that there are no two chess games alike and that there are more possible chess moves than there are atoms in the universe. Dota is even more complex. So is there hope for the new player? In short, yes. There are many many quality resources out there for the education of players, both new and old. There are in game templates to guide you through which items to choose. There are many useful youtube channels offering tutorials and other guides for making the correct choices. And with the streaming technology of today, you can watch popular pro players play their games every day or watch tournament matches to learn the tactics of the best players in the world. The staggering thing about this game is the depth and nuance. The primary name behind the game, Icefrog, has been the caretaker of this game and its predecessor for years. You can tell whenever changes are made that there is a deep understanding behind them, there is a man who has devoted so much time to the game that he understands each interaction and what needs to be done to bring things back into balance. Every change is measured, purposeful, and many of them are outrageously clever. This is a game that rewards both careful thought and study and mechanical practice. As they continue to flesh out the features, I\u0027m sure it will be easier to track and measure your progress, but as it is, it\u0027s very rewarding to learn new things and apply them to your play. This is truly a brilliant game.… ",

I wouldn\u0027t recommend it if you\u0027re a casual gamer and can\u0027t be bothered to invest that time. If that\u0027s the case and you want to play a MOBA then that\u0027s where LoL comes in. If you already play LoL and want something more challenging and more rewarding then by all means try Dota 2. Plus it has way better graphics, great character customization and doesn\u0027t require any money to unlock heroes (which I find very frustrating in LoL). It is also more balanced imo. As for the community, well it\u0027s still a MOBA so don\u0027t expect too much, although it\u0027s not so bad.… ",

First match making I think it has improved, but it is still source of annoyance Second no single player ladder Third lots of misbehaving players (I have to confess, that I do use offensive language sometimes too) Despite that shortcomings Dota 2 offers intensive and diverse experience. After several months of playing it I still enjoy it (not as much as at the beginning but still enough to play it very often). I strongly recommend it. Ps. One more remark. I rate Valve business model higher than Riot\u0027s all meaningful content is free. You pay only for visuals (or access to transmissions from tournaments). In LoL you are encouraged to spend usually new champions are stronger than existing plus limited choice of champions affects your game-play. This is very discouraging.… ",

Dota 2 bring out the competitive spirit in us, and not everyone handles it as well as they should. You will meet people that rage and trash talk, but your skin will grow thick, and it is my experience that the report system works fairly well. I do wish that Valve would be a bit better at communicating with it\u0027s player base though. I must also admit that their development speed seems to have slowed down a lot these last 6 months.

I\u0027m still just scratching the surface on a lot of the deeper concepts, but am enjoying myself for the most part. The game is plagued in my opinion by language issues (in a very team based game). I set my language preference to english and play on US servers, but still see most of my matches dominated by people who can\u0027t speak english. I think this could be solved by electing to join region locked queues perhaps (i\u0027m no expert however). For me this is the largest issue I have with Dota and it is extremely painful. I\u0027ve tried my hand at LoL and found Dota to be more geared to mature gamers and it has a deeper and more complex system. I just could not be bothered to play League when I have the option.… ",

This game is much harder than League of Legends in the respect that there are mechanics in DotA 2 that is not present in LoL. Mechanics such as denying, day and night vision difference, creep blocking, the concept of a courier system, or things such as being punished for dying via losing gold (aka reliable and unreliable gold). As you start playing DotA 2 and accepting such mechanics exist in the game, it becomes more fluid and you start to develop game sense such as mini-map awareness, your reliable gold vs unreliable gold, the time (aka if it is night or day). These are small things that you might not become aware at first, but it\u0027s one of the things you will see yourself improving very significantly. Combined with the fact that every game is different, and there is a counter to every hero, it is a rewarding game that allows you to explore more of yourself as a gamer.… ",

They cant hook they feed andddddd if their good well u wont see good pudge pickers often -THE LAGGERS they will most often pick a carry or a mid hero and suck at it before they tell u the truth that their lagging -The people who find the game boring but still play it to tell other people its boring... well these people just belong in hell The secret to not playing wif idiots is to not be one urself orrr u can just have a party of 5 people well besides the idiots in matchmaking they often pair people like myself who have won around 300+ games with people which have 5 wins. And guess wut the everybody on the enemy side have OVER 600+ wins while im stuck with idiots who picks only carries and pudge. and it seems that if im playing alone in pubs people cant seem to talk english becos its too hard. other than the matchmaking system being this game offers a lot of fun if u play wif friends.

If you compare that to leg of lesbians where you dont have any idea how good a player is, you cant really play agains bots, atleast not any who have a brain, so you have to play for a while to have a chance to win, you dont have to have played any rounds in this game before you have a chance to win if you are against opponents who is around your own lvl. So its easy to start and itll get more and more intense and harder and harder the more you play because youll get to play against ppl who is at your own lvl and therefor have played it about as long as you have.

It is also deceptively complex. Coming from Starcraft 2, I believed the game would be a child\u0027s toy meant to satisfy those who could not handle a truly competitive game. The reality is that the game is not a RTS where your APM and build order are vitally important, instead it is more like a FPS where your ability to work with your team is important. The heroes are individually simple but in a 5v5 format the interactions between the various heroes and items can make for interesting matches. You are not picking a hero like in an MMO, you are picking a hero that fits the situation based on the other heroes in the match. The game does have it\u0027s negatives. In particular the game is very hostile to new players or players who are just having a bad game. Due to the anonymity of the internet, the 4 other people who depend on you are not as reluctant to let their frustration show at the earliest provocation. I highly suggest any new player simply mute their team at the start of their first 100 matches. You will still see important information like pings but will not have to suffer their taunts for your mistakes. Another glaring flaw is highly controversial to the community. The game does not have a surrender option. Much of the vocal component of the community detest a surrender option. They claim such an option would result in people surrendering by default at the first sign of difficulty and would prevent the back and forth that is possible in a game. I consider this an idiotic notion as there are ways to give a surrender option when there is no reasonable expectation that a victory is possible. Without a surrender option, teams that secure a highly probable win (ie: Destroying one lane\u0027s barracks) do not play the rest of the game with the same intensity as before securing the win. The games last about 10-15 minutes after they have been decided due to a lack of urgency as the other team farms kills in your fountain, goes back to farm for some item they really want to own, or simply stands back and taunts you.… ",

Everything has a purpose. The game is very hardcore and may be boring at times, but teamfights and base pushes are never a dull moment. The character design is excellent, and each hero is completely different than the other. There are many roles you can play for your team. Each hero plays out differently and in an unique way. This is why strategy and skill are huge factors when it comes to playing well in DOTA 2. Playing correctly, making the right decisions as a team, getting the right items at the right time, and teamwork are very important if you want to win. Because of this, you always feel like you\u0027ve actually accomplished something or that you still need improvement. You can even customize heroes by receiving or buying items, each hero having numerous combinations of looks to choose from. You never have to pay for any of the heroes in the game. All heroes in the roster pool are and always will be free to play. The only thing you have to pay for is the option to customize your characters, announcers, and even couriers. The only thing I would have to say about the negatives of this game is that it\u0027s not as new-player-friendly as League of Legends, and there are only new game modes when it comes to DireTide and Greevus. Rather than that, this game is a must-play, but not a game that should be played by people new to MOBA\u0027s. I rate this game an 8/10.… ",

Calling it a skill-based game is almost something of an understatement. Dota 2 is about \"growing up\" alongside all the mechanics it provides. There will never be an aspect of the game that you will have truly mastered at 100% and even if you are somehow able to, there will be uncountable other details and lessons you can learn to understand even better. It\u0027s learning, it\u0027s having fun, it\u0027s experimenting, it\u0027s getting rewarded for your efforts. This is a truly immortal game that you\u0027ll never sink enough hours into.

For that reason we do not promise salvation, we simply deliver it.\" In the years to come I would fight many wars with the ancient heroes, but often I look back and think about how I got here. Had Gaben not given me this gift of knighthood, had I missed out on IceFrog’s training, I think I’d be a lesser man for it.

I do admit that the hat market is enormous BUT since it does not affect the game in any way(other than giving virtual Barbies for people like me) I see no bad in it. It is a way to earn some cash for community members too, assuming you have the skill and imagination to create a nice enough item. Valve announced a big patch coming out this month and also proved that they do care for the community, unlike some people claim. Thanks Valve… ",

From the unique interesting designs, to interactions based on lore between the heros, from great support to an absolutely true free-to-play game model. For people familiar with the genre The game is exceptionally balanced. Seemingly every hero is Overpowered and not a single one feels useless. There are only very -very- few abilities that actually overlap, with pretty much all abilities spread between the 100+ all feeling unique and interest. From it\u0027s gameplay, to it\u0027s sound design, heck even to it\u0027s visual design (if the quality of added cosmetics doesn\u0027t degrade) the game impresses on all fronts.

I wouldn\u0027t recommend it if you\u0027re a casual gamer and can\u0027t be bothered to invest that time. If that\u0027s the case and you want to play a MOBA then that\u0027s where LoL comes in. If you already play LoL and want something more challenging and more rewarding then by all means try Dota 2. Plus it has way better graphics, great character customization and doesn\u0027t require any money to unlock heroes (which I find very frustrating in LoL). It is also more balanced imo. As for the community, well it\u0027s still a MOBA so don\u0027t expect too much, although it\u0027s not so bad.… ",

The concept of free to play with all gameplay related content unlocked has become a new standard in my eyes, given how successful valve has been with dota. Games like Path of Exile are following suit, and hopefully the days of grinding to unlock characters in a game are coming to an end.

The improvements implemented are beyond my wildest expectations, and their support of the growing professional scheme has completely blown my mind. DotA is a strategy game enjoyable at any skill level, recently a handful of coworkers tried it out and have been hooked as well. I\u0027m pleased to see the wide appeal of a team-based cooperative yet highly competitive game mixing elements of micro-management, RPG, and tower defense. DotA gave birth to an amazing new genre of gaming and Dota 2 well deserves to be at the forefront of computer gaming, catering to serious and casual players alike, without damaging micro-transactions, and is posed to lead the gaming community into a new era of broadcasted e-sports.

Dota2 is an incredibly deep and fun game. While it does have a steep learning curve (90+ heroes, each with 4+ skills and 6 inventory slots that you can fill from among ~100 different items), there is a tutorial system and built-in hero guides. Once you start to grasp what the different heroes and items do though (it\u0027s good to have friends to play with!), you come to realize the immense replayability of Dota2 and the combinatoric explosion of interesting hero/skill interactions, given that it\u0027s a 5v5 game. I have played more hours of Dota2 than any other game, and it is not becoming boring at all I\u0027m still learning new interactions and tactics all the time. Definitely play with friends as much as you can, to speed learning and make the games more enjoyable and friendly. Another aspect of Dota2 that Valve has done a good job with is competitive play. There are high-quality tournaments played by professional teams running all the time, which you can watch ingame or on twitch.tv. You can view the player perspective (including mouse movements and clicks) of professional players, which is a great way to learn different heroes and special tactics. And the game is free! All heroes/skills/items are free and the game is in no way pay-to-win. Definitely watch some VODs or streams, round up some friends, and give it a try!… ",

If that\u0027s not enough for you to try this game I don\u0027t know what is. The only thing that you have to spend in order to play this game is time. That\u0027s right, Dota 2 is not like most other games and that\u0027s because it\u0027s very complex, so be patient",

Read the heroes, try them out and then you will be ready. This is the game that has higher skillcap than dark souls, but only because the ones you play against are humans, that can also make the game very easy, play with ppl on your level if you want to have a really good experience of the game.

In DotA 1, you can barely see what\u0027s going on; in DotA 2, you can see things. DotA 1 is based off WC3, which is not free, and gets updates ported back; DotA 2 is standalone, and gets updates first, although it is still missing some heroes as of writing. In LoL, you have to unlock or pay for heroes, gameplay-affecting masteries, and have to pay for cosmetics, but some baseline level of Asian-style T\u0026A is free. In DotA 2, all heroes are free, and there is no equivalent to masteries, so the only thing you can spend money on is expensive cosmetics, which do not significantly effect the lower level of baseline T\u0026A. In LoL, meta is very rigid, games snowball easily, and the game is more forgiving to mistakes; in DotA 2, meta is flexible, comebacks are extremely common, and mistakes are punished hard. In HoN, everyone is angry at you and leaves your game; in DotA 2, only select ethnic groups (decided based on a player\u0027s mood at time of abandon) are angry at you, and players generally leave the game slightly less. In a nutshell, DotA 1 and HoN are for players that have played for 10 years and put up with the problems. LoL is casual, which makes it trivial to learn and better for playing games with friends. So DotA 2 is basically king right now, if not in player count. So what makes a DotA 2? It\u0027s a MOBA/ARTS/DotA-like game, which means it pits two teams of five heroes against each other, each occupying half of the square map, with territory on opposite corners, divided by the diagonal. Each side has an \"ancient\" which can be reached through three lanes. The lanes are protected by two barracks (which spawn friendly \"creeps\" periodically), and 3 towers. The goal of the game is to eventually push with the creeps down the enemy lanes to reach and destroy their ancient. Heroes gain gold and experience by killing enemy and neutral units, which they spend on items and skills that last until the end of the round. So a game goes through the arc of an RPG in about an hour: you normally first spend time hitting low-level creeps with basic attacks, then you take on higher level creeps and enemy heroes with basic abilities and items, and in the endgame (if you could afford the items and skills) you go all out with a nearly full loadout of skills and items. But this arc of battle is made interesting by how the mechanics interact. Interestingly, there are 5 heroes per side, but 3 lanes, meaning that there are several different ways to split heroes between lanes, so you\u0027ll often see interesting splits, like trilanes. You can often win the game by going with an esoteric item build (as long as you know what you\u0027re doing) and communicating with your team. Thanks to intense fog of war, wards and team communication are fundamental for map control. Positioning and timing are very important during teamfights. And things like last hits/denies introduce skill to even basic farming. You get the idea there are lots of mechanics to keep track of, teamwork is important, and there are ways to learn all of them. DotA 2 is a great game to play with a team of four other friends, and a game with a very high skill ceiling. Thanks to all the different ways the mechanics can fall together, it\u0027s a very enjoyable game to watch, too. It\u0027s pretty much at the pinnacle of its genre.… ",

And unlike, LoL or HoN which require you to use a rotating hero list until you buy your own with real money or accumulate enough in-game currency to purchase a single hero, DOTA 2 immediately gives you access to its entire library of heroes, for free. In LoL as of the date of this post, it would cost $588 to unlock all heroes with real money. (15000RP/$100, total cost heroes 88185 RP. This calculation excludes bundles) Each character has a unique playstyle and skillset, and doesn\u0027t feel like a clone of another character or a cheap rip off. Every character plays a certain role well, and plays it uniquely. Playing well leads to great rewards, and playing poorly has severe consequences. There are issues with DOTA 2, the biggest being there is a huge learning curve and you are going to start out being bad if you don\u0027t have previous DOTA experience. Learning characters skills, what items do, and what you should be doing early mid and late game initially may be overwhelming. However, doing research and practicing eventually pay off as DOTA 2 is truly one of the most challenging and highest skill cap games available. Valve is also implementing (or has implemented) a tutorial, but there is no way the sheer amount of information needed is contained within it. But I\u0027m sure its a great place to start.… ",

With fair graphics and abundance of free heroes to choose from, Dota 2 will definitely capture the attention of dedicated and devoted players. However, casual players beware, as the smallest mistakes in Dota 2 will punish you deeply, and with even the slightest wrong selection of your hero from the selection screen may set you to play out a long, inevitable defeat, as the games\u0027 balance is centred around heroes countering each other. If you are to look over the incredibly high skillfloor (new players of the genre may find this game somewhat even stressing at times), you might set yourself up for a game that you might find exciting and rich. Lastly, I recommend that you do not listen wholeheartedly to the critics so endorsing Dota 2. You must play the game to see if you really like it, because what they tell you, I -will- completely guarantee you that you will find a rather different experience actually playing the game, whether the experience for you would be exciting, or plain-right stressful.… ",

It has improved upon the WarCraft 3 ARTS custom map in ways that makes the game more visually appealing and it helps get new players up to speed quickly. I am not going to say that this game is better or worse than any of its competitors, only that it offers something else. Case in point: League of Legends offers a free-to-play platform where abilities are mostly comprised of \"skill shots\", contains a leveling system where the higher level you are, the more points into a tech tree you can spend and the more power-ups you can put on your character (which affect how your characters play in-game). In addition, League of Legends offers you a point system where points are earned by playing games and those points can be used to buy power-ups and unlock more heroes. Defense of the Ancients 2 is also a free-to-play game. However, there is nothing outside of actual game play that changes your character\u0027s abilities and the full roster of released heroes is readily available to you at the beginning of your DotA 2 adventure. If you have never picked up DotA or any ARTS games and you are using this to see if you are interested, please listen to me when I say it would be a good idea to fully finish the tutorial and play multiple practice games against bots. It will still match you up with 4 other people to take on AI controlled heroes, so you can still try to learn how to coordinate with other players online without the humiliation of playing against seasoned veterans. I strongly suggest starting on the easiest setting and take in where you can go, what some of the abilities do, and what limits can you push without getting yourself killed. Once you have progressed and crushed the hardest of bots underneath your trained foot do I recommend that you start really doing public match making.… ",

If you already play LoL and want something more challenging and more rewarding then by all means try Dota 2. Plus it has way better graphics, great character customization and doesn\u0027t require any money to unlock heroes (which I find very frustrating in LoL). It is also more balanced imo.

Unlike other f2p games, Dota 2 is completely dedicated to making sure that nothing that is available for purchase in the game gives any sort of advantage-- all you\u0027ll find in the Dota 2 store are extra costumes and pets that are just pretty reskins of existing models. There is nothing separating your account from any of the professional players and will never have to be concerned about being beaten by a player merely because they have played the game longer than you and have more customization options. Now, all of that is fine and dandy-- but utterly meaningless if the game is bad. Good thing that isn\u0027t a concern either-- the gameplay in Dota is on a much larger scale than any other game within the genre. The magnitude of the plays that you can make are massive, and each character is radically different from another rather than being a slight variation within the same role with a slightly different line-shaped nuke, gap-closer, and steroid. Extra abilities are purchased as items, which often have active effects that can give you an edge over your enemies or make your combos flow faster and harder. Finally, the game is developed by VALVe and has quickly overshadowed their other games, Team Fortress 2 and Counter Strike in terms of playerbase and is steadily climbing. Dota 2 will continue to grow, but even now there\u0027s no concern for a dead playerbase or long matchmaking queues. Balance of the game is undertaken by the enigmatic Icefrog, an anonymous developer with complete creative control of the game who has been controlling the game\u0027s direction for the past decade. He is the man who has grown Dota 2 from a small minigame diversion to a trailblazer for the genre and has inspired a steady amount of games to rise in his wake. It is not clear if he will ever be unmasked, but numerous theories float around the internet!… ",

Then there was this patch 6.79, the team had totally changed the direction of the game from when I had started playing (the actual game like camp changes, buyback changes, etc.) and much more changes, weather some were good or bad in terms of keeping or making the game enjoyable the majority of the ones I personally disagree with (you may absolutely love them but I didnt). The game is now in a new direction geared towards new players and working on projects that are not a main part of the actually game. After TI3 (their big e sports event) they had took a long break to make cosmetics to sell on the market. They had under met their expectations of how the game would grow from TI3 and thus they thought to indulge overall improvements to stuff that may or may not appeal to new players but can ruin the game for existing players. There is no ranked system and they had removed looking up players by a broad system that showed players in Normal, High, or Very high brackets. Thus unable to look up yourself or friends to know how well ur improving or slacking off AND the reason they removed this is because players dont like to play and be judged or feel under pressure to perform w/ bad teams.. etc etc. Overall there is no lasting fun and the DOTA 2 team is unpredictable.… ",

Issues have been there since launch and still have not been fixed, communicated by Valve. In spite of the development forum being flooded with threads about matchmaking issues and foreign speaking flamers on English servers, the problems persist, with no sign from Valve of any fix.

I played this game since 2008. To give you a DotA-Timeline perspective, Ice Frog released Clockwerk as a new hero around the time I started to play seriously.

Before I write this review, I\u0027d like to let you know that I\u0027m a DotA veteran. I played this game since 2008. To give you a DotA-Timeline perspective, Ice Frog released Clockwerk as a new hero around the time I started to play seriously. I have thousands of gameplay hours clocked in if I include DotA 1 as well as 2. In terms of ladder, I am most definitely not a pro but I have matched against pros time to time in match makings. But I dare say I understand the game enough to analyze current metas and know why it works [TL;DR] You can skip to \"Pros and Cons\" by scrolling down. At this point, I\u0027m going to assume you have at least tried LoL or other moba games and was interested in reading DotA 2. So I\u0027m going skip a lot of basics. DotA 2 is strictly a TEAM game. It doesn\u0027t matter if you are a god-like player, if your team mates doesn\u0027t perform well compare to your opponents, you will most likely lose. It\u0027s not like a FPS games where 1 player can all-kill purely by skill or luck. You can only pull that kind of off in this game if you have a good mechanic, playing a \"carry\"ish hero, and your team-mates make you a room to farm. Such thing as \"luck\" comes last. That being said, you WILL get flamed for and mocked for, if you put up a terrible performance. Overall, if you are interested in DotA 2, I am going to assume you are one of these 3s. 1. You were interested in this game because it\u0027s free to play. 2. You are a LoL player and wanted to try DotA. 3. Your friend is making you play. With that in mind, I will put this game as \"Pros and Cons\" in terms of Moba game. Pros: -Solid Graphics and Design (Unified Environment+Heroes Immersion) -Unique Hero Compositions(Reduction on Repetitiveness) -Occasional Free Cosmetic Items(Like TeamFortress 2) -Steam Workshop(Google it) -Sustained Patches from Developers -Great Online Community Support for Guides and Info -Holiday Game Modes (Dire Tide) -Good Tutorial -Good In-game Functions like watching live-games or In-game Wikipedia. Double-Edged: -Huge Learning Curve (Bad for new comers Time Consuming) -Strictly Team based vs. Individual Skill based -Punishment System (Disconnects, Deny Creeps, Gold Penalties from Dying) -Complex Items (Recipes, locations, and etc) -Unbalanced and will Never truly be Balanced (Any games that aren\u0027t mirror-matched will never be balanced but that\u0027s what makes the game \"fun\" ultimately) -Stricted Map (1 Map but many In-game game modes like All-Pick, Captains-Mode, Random Draft, etc) -Very slow new hero development unlike \"HoN\" or \"LoL\". (This is a good thing for balancing reasons but many players still want new heroes to try) Cons: **** Players for Beginners (Cursing I Understand, but there are occasional piece of players who will report you for not performing well) -Average 35~50 Min. per Game (Long Match Commitment) -Rise in Blood Pressure/Possible Hair Loss (Frustration, It\u0027s inevitable) -Hard to play this game Casually due to \"Competitiveness\" and \"Complexity\" -Lack of direct Developer involvement with Players like \"LoL\". (Riot Youtube channel have a show called Summoner Showcase, this type of involvement with community is something Valve lacks.) Overall, DotA 2 is clearly not a perfect game. However, it\u0027s purely user created contents due to it\u0027s Player vs. Player element. Valve is doing a good job to constantly improve the game, there is no denying it. DotA 2 may not be as colorful and creative as League of Legends, but... it\u0027s a solid game in terms of mechanics and strategy varieties. You can try this game, but unless you are willing to invest time into this game, I don\u0027t recommend you to play this game. That\u0027s my personal thought. Thank you.… ",

The single player training missions and Valve\u0027s commitment to keeping the game alive are the only saving graces of this free to play game. The main part of the game is multiplayer. While Valve have exceeded in delivering great multiplayer experiences in their past games, they\u0027ve truly dropped dropped the ball in Dota 2. It\u0027s a team based game but it\u0027s an extremely rare occurrence for you and your team to even speak the same language or even reside on the same continent. With the size of the playerbase of Dota 2, that isn\u0027t something that can be overlooked. In this type of game, the entire experience is dependent on team communication. And it\u0027s all bad. 95% of communication in this game is namecalling and \"report\" threats. I thought Counter Strike had the worst community of any multiplayer-centric game until I played Dota 2. There are tools to get over the language barriers, but that\u0027s not the biggest problem. It\u0027s the matchmaking. Every game I\u0027ve played so far has been a white wash for my team or the opponents. People call \"GG\" after first blood and games rarely last longer than 30 minutes. Since there\u0027s almost no penalty for leaving a game, many people abandon and the whole game becomes a waste of time. As for actual game mechanics, I don\u0027t have any praise for those either. Ability descriptions are inconsistent, NPC AI is inconsistent, items are inconsistent, even the hero naming scheme is inconsistent. It feels like a good idea for a game bogged down by engine limitations and poor foresight from the designers. The tutorials explain a little about the game, but players are expected to know almost every ability and item before playing online which is an almost impossible feat without player coaching. I can\u0027t recommend this game to anyone unless they love tower defence and they\u0027re playing it offline with bots.… ",

Dota is a game of the mind more than anything else. It tests your awareness, your ability to outwit and outsmart your opponent. The problem, however, is that the game is plagued by its community. Because Dota relies more upon the ability of the team than the skill of the individual, you will find yourself becoming frustrated with players who perform poorly. In addition to the poor community, the game has a very high learning curve. The learning curve, however, is a good thing, as it allows for Dota to have a great deal of depth. The best way to approach this, if you are a new player, is to accept that you suck, and simply persist. You will not experience the joy of Dota until you can play it competently. It will likely take you a few months to get a basic sense for the games various heroes and mechanics, but it is the journey that is important, not the destination. Dota 2 is an amazing, beautiful game if you can get past the learning curve. To avoid the ever dreaded community, play with your friends.… ",

The Positives: Endless of hours of gameplay Endless combinations of heroes Special game modes for holidays Easy to set up games with friends, to play with each other or against other teams Beautifully crafted Awesome contributions of items from the community The Negatives: The community. Some people are just real a-holes. The matchmaking feels incredibly broken at times. You either demolish the other team or you get demolished. It is rare to get opponents with equal skill level. Language barriers: This mostly concerns russians that don\u0027t speak a word of english and they don\u0027t care what you say if they happen to speak english. I\u0027ve learned more russian profantiy from this game than I care to admit. You can almost count the heroes with \"skill shots\" (e.g. sacred arrow, hook etc.) on one hand. Smurfing. Players that already have hundreds of hours played create new accounts to be matched against newbies. This will ruin games for beginners. A ladder is sorely missed for many players. This would enable better match making and for teams that don\u0027t play on a professional level some time in the spotlight too. Sometimes too much focus on items and customizability than on gameplay and updates of core mechanics. As you can see, the majority of the problems that this game suffers from are the community. Valve has taken some steps to solve this (e.g. choosing preferred language in games, choosing lane from character selection), but it rarely gets to the core of it, namely, player stupidity. That being said, this game is best played with five friends against other players, or just playing in house games with a larger group of friends. If you play this solo and never played DotA before, get ready to be flamed and discouraged to learn the game. The new coaching feature is for you.… ",

All this aside, the games do get competitive, but in my opinion, this is the only real thing going for it, the constant thriving to beat the opponent. If you do not connect with the community in some way, then it\u0027s not a particularly enjoyable affair. It\u0027s free though, so it\u0027s definitely at least worth a look, perhaps you\u0027ll love it, or perhaps you\u0027ll hate it...

Pros: Just about everything that makes this game what it is, from deep gameplay, to all classes for free, to user generated content, competitive spectating, large roster, tight controls, and great User Interface. cons: Matchmaking takes a long time and is poorly designed, community can be harsh if you don\u0027t know how to play, game is hard if you\u0027re never played a MOBA before.… ",

Players will not call you by your username or name, but by your hero name, putting you in the role of that hero. Dota 2 is by far the best MOBA game ever made hands down.

The amount of depth included in this game is phenomenal. At the time of this review, I have played roughly 1,500 hours of Dota 2 and there is still so much to learn. The only problem I, and many of my friends, have had with Dota is the sometimes arrogant, immature and hateful community. I understand that every community has a few bad apples, but in Dota, they are much more prevalent. An example is the entire \"Diretide\" scenario; because the fans didn\u0027t receive a holiday event that they were expecting, they published negative reviews of the game, spammed Facebook pages and ranted all over the Internet after all the effort that Valve has put in. Those without tough skin may want to seek elsewhere, as playing through your first 100 games without in some way being criticised or insulted is almost impossible due to Dota\u0027s highly competitive nature. But for those who can withstand criticism and are willing to invest time into the game are going to be rewarded by the amount of depth and playability that Dota 2 offers.… ",

However, there is one facet of this game that keeps me from giving it a 10. The community. There are plenty of friendly, fun people playing the game but they are the silent majority. It is almost guaranteed that you will have at least a couple rotten, pathetic losers in each match. Generally they will attack the person that in their mind is bringing the team down and it can quite often ruin the experience for everybody involved. In summation, this game is definitely worth a try. If you have thin skin make frequent use of the mute button and most of your matches will go smoothly. The learning curve for this game is very steep but also very rewarding.… ",

If you already play LoL and want something more challenging and more rewarding then by all means try Dota 2. Plus it has way better graphics, great character customization and doesn\u0027t require any money to unlock heroes (which I find very frustrating in LoL). It is also more balanced imo. As for the community, well it\u0027s still a MOBA so don\u0027t expect too much, although it\u0027s not so bad… ",

Nope be prepared to be faustrated to the point of no return. I have uninstalled this game as I can truly see no positive coming from this game. People are rude. The team play is near non existent unless you are on a team and everyone wants to have the score despite no record keeping being held on the game. Yes it is easier to potty train your children then to progress past a point in this game. Then if you make mistakes instead of being coached you get bashed on continuesly until your spirit is not even in the game no more. Yes Potty training is not fun, but at least your kids arent bashing you continuesly while your coaching them to aim their skills correctly. Soapbox out and I\u0027ve uninstalled this trainwreck for the last time.

For a free game, this offers thousands of hours of entertainment as you encounter players from all around the globe. Team up with your friends for your best chances of winning and minimising rage-inducing moments. It is unfortunate that there are many players out there who will go out of their way to make it hell for one to play. Steel yourself for the insults and cat calls and all the \u0027your mum\u0027 jokes because it will all come back with the fields of twelve year olds roaming on the servers. However, if you\u0027re lucky to encounter courteous players, you\u0027re in for a treat. There are ban systems in place to educate those to overstep the boundaries. Remember guys, it is just a game, no need to get too mad over a few deaths and lost kills. Game mechanics are mostly sound, a few minor bugs and tweaks, updates are constant, albeit at times small, they do make a difference to the game play. If you do find some bugs, it is mostly hilarious than become a game breaking moment. There are heroes to suit every play style and several modes for your choice of play: ALL PICK for a somewhat uneven play field. For your best shot, perhaps the least played hero mode. For those who are just looking for a good time with laughs; the Random Ability Draft mode is sure to tickle your fancy with a vast variety of skills being up for grabs for the random hero you are allocated. Enjoy! A great game all in all. Great for quick games (usually 40 minutes long) if you\u0027re not in the mood for something too long. Regular and attentive updates and a good 90+ heroes for you to master.… ",

It\u0027s satisfying to perform tactics that you and your teammates plan, providing an exciting challenge against your enemies. While the design can be irritating at times, and while the user interface in-match could be less distracting, Dota 2, in the most time, flawlessly and beautifully. The heroes are divided by two optional choices for their hero: to make him an attacker or supporter. It depends on the overall strength and power value that the hero has. It\u0027s a must to strategize with the two elements combined, because it makes for a good teamwork and a valuable time. Killing other players is important, but slashing some creeper blood isn\u0027t bad either, helping the player to earn coins for buying important items and to earn experience, which levels you up to upgrade your powers. The powers are specialized attacks or other abilities which need to be used cleverly to positively perform the duty. They either do damage, heal, teletransport, make clones... you get it, there is a LOT of abilities counting all the heroes. And the items too need to be bought and used smartly, where the player needs to focus more on suggested items. If the suggested items are not workable right, then the dictionary helps you with everything, starting from instructions by users, to actually and visually showing what items and powers to focus on. It\u0027s really helpful. Also, crafting needs to be mentioned, for, basically, buying the expensive items that you want easier and safer. The objective of every match is to destroy enemies\u0027 defenses and to finally destroy the Ancient tower of the enemy. When you with your teammates do that, your team wins. But it gets more complicated than that, because on the other hand enemies are trying to do the same thing. If they teamwork and use powers well, they\u0027re more likely to win. But, to prevent that from happening, obviously you with your teammates need to do better than that. Playing individually is not recommended, because it shows selfishness to the player and the team might loose. So, the most important obligation is teamwork in this game. The game itself has some modes which don\u0027t change the gameplay style, but only the hero selection style. And that is really nice, because it adds multiverse to the game. I don\u0027t know if you understood the last sentence, but you\u0027ll get it if you dig deeper. Does the tutorial help? Yes, it kind of does, but you need to get an experienced player to instruct you how to play the game. And playing with bots when you start playing is recommendable. Is this game good? Dota 2 is a fantastic MOBA. Well, what did you expect from Valve? 8/10… ",

This means that there are more than 448 skills which you need to memorize the function of just so you won\u0027t be at a disadvantage when facing off against someone using them. Then you have to get a grasp of the highly complex mechanics, and various strategies that take a long time to learn. There are also over 100 items in the store, the purchasing of which varies from one hero and situation to the next. Again, Dota 2 is simply too complicated for its own good.

If you are not willing to put in many hours a few moments of pure frustration, read no more. This game is not for you. If you will not accept that defeat may occur in the most humiliating way, read no more. If you cannot accept that updates are made based on the most recurring needs, not your own, read no more. -- This game has massive potential, but the potential of any given match is determined by the players. If you want a perfectly even match, you cannot find it! The reason being that a \u0027perfect\u0027 match cannot exist! You will find matches that are so leaned one way that you stand no chance! However, that does not mean you should quit. The \u0027currency\u0027 of dota is build items. The more you have, the more money and/or time you have put in the game. Typically, items are awarded only to the best player of the winning team, but one can earn an item regardless if you are good enough. Just to put an example, I once had a game where 3 out of the 5 people on my team quit. This meant that odds were 100% I would lose. But i played well enough I was awarded an item. -- Valve is a large company. They simply could not support a customer feedback group large enough to help every single person within a timely manner. Sending something to valve only ensures that the said mail will be read at some point, not that you will get a reply. Many low reviews comment on the slowness of the updates. This is not true. Small updates are made almost constantly in a process called the \u0027balance changelog\u0027 which ensures that no hero/item is too powerful. Major updates, such as a new character or likewise feature are rare, but no rarer than in any other game! -- People will sabotage a game for their own. Many low reviews state that dota is horrible in every way. I would be surprised if the majority of these people did not play league of legends, a similar and fun spin-off of dota. Critics judge the game without comparison to others, it is their job. Meanwhile the rest of us cannot help our bias. I have mine, you have yours, and every other review on this page has theirs. -- Dota is, by no stretch of the imagination, perfect. It has its flaws, such as a community that for the most part I have found to be silent or polite, but with some nastiness found on any multiplayer game. Honestly, the community is better here than on any console shooter I\u0027ve played. There are bugs that can ruin a game and that people claim exist forever (In reality valve does not tell you they are fixed, they just fix the bugs) and of course the matchmaking! Remember that while some matches are unfair, the computer is doing the best with what it has. The computer can only put you in a match for the regions you select with other people joining a game at the same time as you. Be kind to the robots. They will spare you in the uprising. -- People lie. If you believe every statistic given here, you are a fool. Many of the facts are true to a specific point in time far in the past, and many more are simply lies given by people who got beat up by a bloodseeker their first game and never played again. I hope this review has been helpful. And please, don\u0027t judge after one game. Thats like judging you based on a single sentence you have uttered. (This would be uh.... for most of us)… ",

You see, this is a team based game, and unless you are going to play with friends, you can bet you\u0027re going to get matched with someone who doesn\u0027t speak the language you queued up for. The amount of toxicity in the community is insane, and the only counter to it which VALVE have so far is a simple mute, which only ruins the game for people who get matched with the muted player. The game also has an inexcusably huge amount of unfixed, confirmed bugs, if I recall correctly, the number is about ~800. Also, ever since The International 2, VALVE have been extremely slow with hero updates(Prior to the The International 2, there were updates that had as many as 3 heroes in them, all coming out each week), while still pushing out cosmetic updates week after week. This games learning curve is steep, and you MUST invest time in watching tutorials, streams, trying out things in a lobby(on top of actually playing the game) if you want to make any sort of progress with it. This, in my opinion, is not bad, but it is very intimidating for newcomers. And with this I\u0027d like to end my review of the game. But no matter what I say, this game is still going to grow, and so is it\u0027s playerbase. Let\u0027s just hope the future is brighter.… ",

I\u0027ve never liked Valve as a company or any of their previous games. I was happy about dota because they got the original developer of the game. I have been playing Dota 2 since early beta and the game is not the same anymore. Is it so hard to mute people you don\u0027t want to talk to through the in-game UI? Apparently Valve thinks so! Whenever I can\u0027t stand Peruvians screaming gibberish or nasally voiced 12 year olds, I just mute them. Nanny Valve doesn\u0027t trust your judgment though, so I guess they\u0027d better mute people themselves so nobody can listen to them!… ",

Is true LoL is a very popular and attractive game, and actually is easiest to begin play this game than dota, but Im sure if you learn to play dota, you would probably dislike LoL a lot, and its because LoL is simpler than DOTA... you really need more skills and more micro. And one of the best things (also, a bad thing for so many) is even if you have the highest skill of the two teams, the highest micro, the highest experiencie, you would probably lose 50 percent of the times. And thats because the game is balanced, is a game of TEAMWORK, if you forget this, you will end thinking in things like \"I lost cause my team was bad\", \"I can\u0027t play this game if Volvo keep trolling me with the team\", so if you team is \"bad\" you have to remember that you are playing with them, so your skills levels are actually the same. If you want to win more you need to keep improving your TEAMWORK skills and your Personal skills. Thats the key.… ",

If you sucks first, lots of my friends did it in 2004 (while in dota1). There are live (2min delayed) games to watch. Watch pro player do they job. Learn. Look dota profile of some best international players, download their game replay. Learn from them and from their mistake. Some hero best against others and worse against another. That where came plenty of items to choose and skills to build. There are no exact guide line or tutorial to play Dota 2 but this one: destroy enemy ancient. Some heroes are nuke, high damage but effective on single low hp enemy. Some heroes are pusher, easily push creeps to destroy enemy creeps, towers, structures. Some heroes are tanker, hardly to kill, protect they team mate doing their nasty jobs to win the game. Some heroes are carry, they choose what enemy heroes to kill first. Some heroes are disabler, silence or stun some or one enemy hero. Some heroes are initiator, initiate war. Some heroes are jungler, stay out of enemy sight Some heroes are weak on war, but good on one-on-one. Some heroes are strong against more enemy heroes. Plenty of items to choose to exploit your jobs assigned in your team. If you are killer, do kill, kill, and keep killing to stop enemy heroes push forward your ancient. If you are pusher, do push, destroy enemy structures (tower, barrack), and it\u0027s okay if you get killed, and killed, and killed again as long as your team win the game. If you are tanker, make sure you are the one being attacked, not your nuke or pusher, since they are usually weak on war, but make sure you don\u0027t die easily.

In a 45 minute to sometimes over an hour match life could call at any moment: wife pregnant, feeder ruining the game or whatever - people naturally want to leave if there\u0027s a problem.

And, ever since Dota 2 came out in Beta, I\u0027ve grown even more attached. I love everything about this game. I\u0027m very competitive in nature, and the level of complexity continually leaves me a ton of things to improve on. I know that the steepness of the learning curve can be a turn-off for a lot of people, but it\u0027s well worth it, in my opinion. It gives a sense of accomplishment, and there are a lot of resources out there for new players to take advantage of. Furthermore, I think the game has a great pace to it. There is never a dull moment, but, at the same time, it\u0027s not physically overwhelming (once you know what other heroes do... to me that\u0027s the biggest hurdle. Things seem to fall into place after you\u0027ve learned that much). Also, the community is actually pretty solid in my opinion. I do think that the massive outpouring of negative reviews on this site is a blemish on the community, but outside of that, I think relative to any other gaming community, Dota\u0027s is actually pretty decent, especially at higher MMRs. In addition, for anyone who likes getting items/cosmetics, Dota has an insane amount. I never really cared about anything like that in the past, yet somehow I still find myself buying compendiums and getting excited when I get an items drop. Lastly, the game is pretty well-balanced. To me, that might be the biggest positive. Yes, there are strong heroes, but every single one of them has a counter. There are some that don\u0027t always fit the meta, but they all have something unique to offer. I\u0027ve never in my life experienced that level of depth and balance in any game whatsoever, and I think that makes the replay value infinite. I don\u0027t think there is any other game out there that has this level of competition AND depth. Sure there are deep RPGs, for example. And, there are competitive FPSs. But, nothing has the combination quite like Dota. There are other games in the genre that may come close, but even they don\u0027t have the same complexity. In sum, Dota has something for everyone: fun cosmetics, deep gameplay, a good pace, a high degree of competition, and tools to learn the game. 10/10 no doubt. I\u0027m the type of guy who likes to spread my enjoyment among many activities (sports, board games, video games, any random fun stuff) and yet Dota after many years still seems to sit right near the top of things I like to do (and the amount of time I\u0027ve spent playing it proves it).… ",

The players are: Egotistic, ego centric, unsporting, aggressive, hostile, uncaring, mean, mistrusting, immature, callous, apathetic and incredibly pretentious while at every loss prompting everyone inside the current game to \"Report player X\" if someone on their team was even remotely new to the game or did any other action not sanctified by them, be it going in what lane you want, not purchasing courier/wards or simply just had an unlucky run/getting cross-classed. Along with being completely miserable to be around, they frequently never speak the language in the region you\u0027re playing and nowhere else is this more apparent when russian is spammed into the chat at all times on European zones from 3 different sources at once. And if people do know English, trolling is nothing short but assured from all directions to all teams. Second biggest problem with this game would be the elitist mindset that orbits anyone that has played this atrocious game for more than a couple of hours. Any behavior that breaks the typical dota 2\u0027s hardcore player routine of buying tango, healing salve and iron branches, perhaps with some boots of speed if they\u0027re feeling adventurous will result in a wave of F-bombs, intentional feeding, votes of surrender, spam prompts to report player X and disconnecting users as far as the eye can see. I even had cases where players left the game because some guy forgot to buy a courier at the start of the game. And that\u0027s me overlooking the fact that killstealing off your TEAMMATES is considered average behavior/a common tactic. In LoL, you can even report people for \"being unskilled\". As in, anyone. Even if they\u0027re level 1.To put it bluntly, MOBA\u0027s like dota 2 give out a special kind of disgusting behavior that makes me feel physically ill for very good reasons. Coming close to problem number 2 is the third epic fail problem of this game. The match-making in Dota 2. Broken, poorly thought through and executed horribly. You are prompted to select a variety of regions before initiating the match-making system and the more regions you have selected, the less waiting time.. Which begs the question, what is the point with the regional system if you\u0027re just gonna encourage people to sign up for all regions? The end result will be that nobody sticking to their geographical zones and not only causes frustration in the form of people trying to communicate and chat with eachother in the chat as described above but also disallows any kind of vocal / text tactical communication since everyone does not speak the same language. In all honestly, this game is overloaded with issues just like this and I would be able to overlook this particular embarassing design-flop if it wasn\u0027t for the actual hard functionality of the MM as well being broken. The scenario on where 4-5 organized people in a group, all sitting in ventrilo/teamspeak while packing thousands of hours in Dota 2 each have a very likely possibility to be \"teamed\" up against new players with less than 10 hours with no complaints from the match-making system (even if there is a very large queue) throws out any chance of that. This happens particulary often if you decide to try the game out with a friend or two which leaves me with yet another question: The purpose of match-making was to find equally skilled opponents. So why is this even remotely possible? Team-based games with a mandatory MM are supposed to be fair. Not Tyrannosaurus rex VS a duckling. I\u0027m reluctant to say that Dota 2 even has a match-making at all once you look at all the facts. Even with all these problems, I could actually see myself overlooking them at a certain time during a year due to the sheer amount of possible combinations in this game with heroes \u0026 items and the addictive quality the game has if it wasn\u0027t for all the other flaws. The commitment to play DotA MOBA\u0027s however, is the biggest flaw of them all that this game inhibits. It changes whoever plays the game as a person. For the worse. Why? Because the game inhibits \"addictive\" qualities similar with that of jamming needles full with endorphin into your spine every half hour. It\u0027s painful, it hurts your emotional stability, it hurts you as a person and it hurts the people around you and for what? A small kick of pleasure/self satisfaction as you managed to win a fundamentally unbalanced game with an emphasis on gank above all else due to chance or otherwise pre-meditated \"pubstomping\"? Not worth it in so many ways since at the end of the day, Dota 2 will never be fully balanced because Valve will be split between tournament-balances and casual or the \"normal\" version of the game while repeatedly adding more and more content in the form of heroes. I could keep on going with design flop after design flop but at the end of the day, this game is not worth anyone\u0027s time or dedication.… ",

Valve doesn\u0027t seem to care about this which is very problematic. Because without a good drafting the MOBA genre is a horrible experience which degenerates quickly into a flame fest stomp which just sucks. Also it lacks ranked play and a way to distinguish they players who are out for a casual experience or others that want a competitive approach to DotA. Putting these two types of play styles together always results in a flame fest. Valve has not solved this. And the flame fest is probably what will alienate new players from the game genre. Valve hasn\u0027t put in a adequate system to handle this. The report system they have installed is rather used to report bad play than flame fest which, of course, further will alienate new players.… ",

Valve actually enforces a forced 50% win ratio upon all its users making improvement and illusion, making it so that its users stay hooked playing lies in an attempt to maximize its chances at selling overpriced cosmetic items of which profits go directly to everything but updates with actual content. The game refuses to enforce region lock time and time again despite its players asking for a system to fix the Rosetta Stone advertising virus that is its Third World trolls of which are directly responsible for the unchecked rampant racism throughout the community that by the way is already dangerously toxic to begin with. Those with depression be warned, suicide and every other available insult will be mentioned as a means to fester negative feelings in its new and/or bad players as a means to repel you from this \"game\". The means to report this cyberbullying is unfortunately also an illusion as action comes once in a blue moon. It should be noted that balance does not exist to counter RAT-DOTA (split pushing without committing to team fights) and a means to surrender in a match does not exist despite the rampant smurfing (experienced players in new alternative accounts) in game. Do not be fooled by the paid reviews and spammed 10 point Diretide reviews people, this \"game\" will only waste your time, fun will be nonexistent after your first few good games and addiction will set in quickly forcing you to eventually buy useless pixels and suffer through countless bad matches for one good game that never seems to be enough -- as planned of course by the hired psychologist and higher-ups in Valve.… ",

I have seen the lobbies of eurobattle.net, 5.84b crawled with bugs, and played on custom servers for different regions. All I have to say is Valve has ruined the game ruining the lobby mechanics with a broken matchmaking system, linking players who are completely different by language and region to play a competitive game where every player\u0027s mistake is punished heavily by the game mechanics. Back in the day when people had a set username, you used to carry your reputation around also having a network of players you used to play with from chat channels. This is very important since you can have balanced matches with people in your region or your interest in custom made lobbies that you HAVE TO use in order to play. The current situation is you end up playing with adolescent kids who can\u0027t speak a word of english nor know the game, even in \"high\" brackets at 4-5k MMR. They can ruin your gaming experience and leave without a punishment, lowering your MMR thus pulling you down to play with players exactly like him. I can\u0027t stand the game I grew up playing is ruined by this so called \"community\" oriented company who only uses this game to just milk money out of people. They are not interested in making a better game, they are interested in one thing and one thing only, making PROFITS.… ",

The language barrier that has been erected is stronger than the 14 old year kids urges who play this. If you speak English, and would like to play with English speaking players, find 5 of them and play together. Otherwise you will only play with the aforementioned \u0027REPORTS\u0027. They are so close to fixing the problem... They added these little nifty check boxes for who you want to play with. Check English if you want to play with English players, so on and so forth. The problem is, if you check English, Spanish, Russian etc. all at the same time, the myth is that you get a faster que time. Then there\u0027s the reporting system. If you have a teammate that wants to feed, report him. That way he\u0027ll be in your next game for sure to feed some more. The bottom line is, if you want a game where you can\u0027t understand a single thing your team is saying 80% of the time, play DotA 2. If you want a game where the s**t heads of the community are no longer punished, play DotA 2.

The players are: Egotistic, ego centric, unsporting, aggressive, hostile, uncaring, mean, mistrusting, immature, callous, apathetic and incredibly pretentious while at every loss prompting everyone inside the current game to \"Report player X\" if someone on their team was even remotely new to the game or did any other action not sanctified by them, be it going in what lane you want, not purchasing courier/wards or simply just had an unlucky run/getting cross-classed. Along with being completely miserable to be around, they frequently never speak the language in the region you\u0027re playing and nowhere else is this more apparent when russian is spammed into the chat at all times on European zones from 3 different sources at once. And if people do know English, trolling is nothing short but assured from all directions to all teams. Second biggest problem with this game would be the elitist mindset that orbits anyone that has played this atrocious game for more than a couple of hours. Any behavior that breaks the typical dota 2\u0027s hardcore player routine of buying tango, healing salve and iron branches, perhaps with some boots of speed if they\u0027re feeling adventurous will result in a wave of F-bombs, intentional feeding, votes of surrender, spam prompts to report player X and disconnecting users as far as the eye can see. I even had cases where players left the game because some guy forgot to buy a courier at the start of the game. And that\u0027s me overlooking the fact that killstealing off your TEAMMATES is considered average behavior/a common tactic. In LoL, you can even report people for \"being unskilled\". As in, anyone. Even if they\u0027re level 1.To put it bluntly, MOBA\u0027s like dota 2 give out a special kind of disgusting behavior that makes me feel physically ill for very good reasons. Coming close to problem number 2 is the third epic fail problem of this game. The match-making in Dota 2. Broken, poorly thought through and executed horribly. You are prompted to select a variety of regions before initiating the match-making system and the more regions you have selected, the less waiting time.. Which begs the question, what is the point with the regional system if you\u0027re just gonna encourage people to sign up for all regions? The end result will be that nobody sticking to their geographical zones and not only causes frustration in the form of people trying to communicate and chat with eachother in the chat as described above but also disallows any kind of vocal / text tactical communication since everyone does not speak the same language. In all honestly, this game is overloaded with issues just like this and I would be able to overlook this particular embarassing design-flop if it wasn\u0027t for the actual hard functionality of the MM as well being broken. The scenario on where 4-5 organized people in a group, all sitting in ventrilo/teamspeak while packing thousands of hours in Dota 2 each have a very likely possibility to be \"teamed\" up against new players with less than 10 hours with no complaints from the match-making system (even if there is a very large queue) throws out any chance of that. This happens particulary often if you decide to try the game out with a friend or two which leaves me with yet another question: The purpose of match-making was to find equally skilled opponents. So why is this even remotely possible? Team-based games with a mandatory MM are supposed to be fair. Not Tyrannosaurus rex VS a duckling. I\u0027m reluctant to say that Dota 2 even has a match-making at all once you look at all the facts. Even with all these problems, I could actually see myself overlooking them at a certain time during a year due to the sheer amount of possible combinations in this game with heroes \u0026 items and the addictive quality the game has if it wasn\u0027t for all the other flaws. The commitment to play DotA MOBA\u0027s however, is the biggest flaw of them all that this game inhibits. It changes whoever plays the game as a person. For the worse. Why? Because the game inhibits \"addictive\" qualities similar with that of jamming needles full with endorphin into your spine every half hour. It\u0027s painful, it hurts your emotional stability, it hurts you as a person and it hurts the people around you and for what? A small kick of pleasure/self satisfaction as you managed to win a fundamentally unbalanced game with an emphasis on gank above all else due to chance or otherwise pre-meditated \"pubstomping\"? Not worth it in so many ways since at the end of the day, Dota 2 will never be fully balanced because Valve will be split between tournament-balances and casual or the \"normal\" version of the game while repeatedly adding more and more content in the form of heroes. I could keep on going with design flop after design flop but at the end of the day, this game is not worth anyone\u0027s time or dedication.… ",

Overall pretty average game, graphics are nice and stuff. But the real thing is, it\u0027s not that hard game. Sure learning 90 champions is hard, but if i can find figure out most of the stuff in 20minutes that my team was getting beaten, anyone can do it. My first pvp game was a flamefest, i did not call an missing player and my team died to him....3 times in row for a double kill. Then i was the person with mental issues, i\u0027m feeding and should go back to League. While still holding more farm, less deaths and more income than my team that composed of players who had much more hours in the game than i did (less than 3). MatchMaking sucks as bad as Riot\u0027s, even worse i might add. Every player in my pvp games has experience with the game that i don\u0027t. So i\u0027ll check the game out in 6 months or so again to see what they done with it. Prolly nothing. Short version: - Requires more skill than league. [ ] Yes [x] NO - Full of A-Holes.

The reasons are that whilst it is a very polished and deep MOBA it lacks certain features that attract me to MOBAS as one of my favorite Genres. SO without further adue, let me begin. Okay so first up I want to talk about the good in this game. The classes are varied and each feels like it has an important role. The items pack a punch and a fed character FEELS fed. The map design is flawless with multiple levels of height with ramps needed to access them, however characters with a jump ability etc. can jump straight down. It\u0027s things like this IMO that make a good MOBA. Also, match making is very fast, which is great. No matter what time of day it is I get a match in a few seconds. The next thing, and this is where I am going to get into the negatives, is where I want to talk about the learning vurve (which is what frustrated me the most). When I play a Moba I personally like a locked on camers, if I want to look around etc. I will disable it for a few seconds to do so. However, Dota 2 is lacking any kind nof lock on camera, you can spam a button to simulate it but that is hardly practical. Also, the community are like a pack of hungry wolves waiting for you to slip up. This discourages new users, and if you\u0027re looking at this game as a new player wanting to try it, go play LoL, or even better, Smite. My last, and most ANNOYING peeve i have about this game. The god damn freaking camera movement. Not only is there no lock on camera, but you can\u0027t even use the arrow keys to look around, you have to move your mouse to the edge of the screen. This would often kill me as a ganker would kill me before I could move my mouse to order a move command. All in all this is a great MOBA but a very hardcore one, and if you want MOBA and FUN to be in the same sentence, do not play this game. If you are more serious then you will love it, or if you\u0027re a bit of both. You will have mixed feelings. It all comes down to your personal preference.… ",

The main problem of this game is the gameplay balance once a team has 50% more kills the level and the items are to advance so the only way to win is if they atack 1 by 1 or your team has a numeric advantage for 5 vs 5 they will allways win with 3 players alive so the xp or money system needs balance. Also the money system needs to allow to store the gold in your spawn or send it via courier. As for hero balance there are some overpowered ones and you can lose the game just by picking the wrong hero so that to my is not competitve because you can`t pick a hero in use by other player , the game shoud allow players to pick any hero . The ranking system is very permissive to leavears and often if you play with random players 2-3 are leavears and you are force to play 2 vs 5 or 3 vs 5 , that is not fair and shoud not be scored also the leavers punish by 1 weak to 4 weak bans.… ",

If you shy away from pvp, if you do not like communicating and working with other people you have never met before then you will likely not enjoy your experience with Dota 2 or any game within the larger MOBA genre. However, if you enjoy a game that provides actual challenges, does not grow stale, and that has absolutely no beginning and no end you may just enjoy this. The learning curve for new players is extremely steep. You are dropped into a completely alien system of last hitting, denying, warding, ganking, feeding, and many other words you will eventually learn how to use properly. It is perhaps the most situational game ever as there is never just one proper way to do things and frequently many wrong ways. Things that you believe should work will not and things that seem absolutely crazy and wrong will yield incredibly favorable results and eventually you will learn why. The addition of a tutorial allows completely new players to ease themselves in a bit before jumping into a game with 9 other strangers yelling at them about how badly they suck. And now to the good part, I love this game. It has provided me with hundreds of hours of pain and pleasure. There are times where you will want to quit and times you believe you never will. The word balance seems like a distant dream in a game with over 100 heroes but Valve does a very good job of keeping the game balanced at the highest level of competitive play. The in game client allows you to watch professional tournaments as they are happening along with the commentary provided by the various casters. The game is always providing new experiences, especially after each major patch when Valve completely changes how the most favored heroes work by sometimes not touching them at all. Gameplay and Mechanics are different than any other genre with the exception of the close cousin RTS games as MOBAs originated from the original Starcraft and Warcraft 3. Getting a handle on all necessary tasks for any given role (Carry, Support, etc) in a given situation takes time. You will not master the game in 5 games played and start wrecking everyone. You will always have something new to learn, that is just the nature of this sort of game. Once you learn where you are supposed to be and why you are supposed to be there your life will get much easier and your grasp of the controls will follow. Story doesn\u0027t really exist. There are short backgrounds for the heroes and some of them even feature other heroes but there isn\u0027t a reason you should want to kill the enemy\u0027s giant tree other than competition. And in a game like this that is a good thing, rather than worry about ruining the lore of the game by making some change that will get them in trouble with the community Valve just has to worry about how to balance things with each patch as well as what new features will be beneficial. Music is actually very well done, when the music picks up you will find yourself feeling like you are fighting in an epic battle for the virtual world. Occasionally the sounds or announcer will drown out parts of the music or vice versa but overall it is a very positive experience. They actually just released a new music pack for those who contributed to the prize pool for TI4. Announcers are something that need mentioning. As each match begins, there is an announcer telling the player various things. Many of these things are inconsequential at the beginning of the match. But as the players take their positions and the action begins the announcer keeps you updated on important events taking place on the map including but not limited to who is dying and what towers are under attack, etc. There are many different announcer packs available and some of them are absolutely hilarious (Glados for example). Is your team losing handily to a team that you should absolutely not? That\u0027s okay, let Glados tell you how badly you are doing. Fan of the game Bastion? There is an announcer for you then. The Steam Workshop is directly integrated with Dota 2 and users have access to the Source engine as well so user created content comes in by the truckload. There are many incredibly good looking \"hats\" for the various heroes that have been created by members of the community and those members actually get paid for the sales of the items, it is not just a cash grab for Valve. Currently there are even custom game modes being created to allow any number of possibilities. As I began this post I will end it, this game is not for everyone but if it does happen to strike a chord with you then you are quite likely to love it.… ",

Second problem is; I have many online games before but i have never seen such a disrespectful community. everybody is swearing all the time. there is no stop. This is a team game but it turns out to be a swearing game. And there are too much racist NAZI in the community. You can play with hundreds of players in 1 week but can just report 3 player in 1 week. So these swearing nazis will be a part of your every game. Maybe grouping according to reports can solve this problem but...dota 2 can\u0027t match even same skilled players yet..............… ",

If you haven\u0027t tried this game out I recommend it with all the will in my body. It\u0027s crazy, it\u0027s very deep and even once you\u0027ve played it for literally thousands of hours you\u0027ll still be some way off mastery.

But the biggest thing that made me quit is that the game play isn\u0027t the full thing you are looking for in a MOBA. Hard to get started on this game. Takes a good time to learn and start to actually have fun playing game. The ranking on DOTA is also kinda weird? Overall the Dota 2 is really competitive and the community is nice, but I prefer League Of Legends now because of it\u0027s more immersive gameplay. I feel that League is a better representation of a MOBA because of the laning where their is a top laner, mid laner, jungler, adc, and support. It adds so much to strategy and a variety to the whole game. League is also has much more community and can actually show you affection to the game through it\u0027s super active community.… ",

The original game created the MOBA genre. Now years after the original game, huge popularity and many games to followDota 2 was the sequel (its basically a HD remake, not a sequel) to the hugely popular Warcraft 3 mod. It was based off you select one hero from a pool and you control that hero and your creeps (AI minions) would just come wave after wave and go down a preselected lane. The original game created the MOBA genre. Now years after the original game, huge popularity and many games to follow in its path do we get Dota 2. When they announced this game I was really excited, and even after thousands of hours of playing I do still enjoy it...at times. The game runs flawlessly in the source engine, every animation looking amazing. It makes vast improvements over the original game from pregame hero selection to patches and updates to balance out heroes and items. Since the launch of HoN (Heroes of Newerth) and LoL (League of Legends) I felt less inclined to play the older brother of the 3 and gravitated more to HoN where it got most of its ideas from Dota. S2 games is quite a bit smaller then Valve obviously, but I\u0027ve found they have done a few things right. First off, Dota has the option of what region you want to play in, but no region lock like HoN did. You will queue up for US East, and still get Brazilian and Chinese players. Now nothing against playing with people from different regions, but when you play a game that is reliant on communication, and you speak 2 different languages it makes it difficult. The game really should be region locked. Another thing S2 did was provide a concede vote. When a player leaves the game in a ranked game, you are forced to play out the game or take a leaver status if someone leaves or you are losing. Some teams will drag out the game to an hour if the game could of ended 15 mins in. Another very minor thing would of adding skins for your heroes over very minor pieces of gear. Some barely make your hero unique in any way and basically looks like the same as the default skin, but like i said this is a minor gripe that doesn\u0027t affect game play at all. Overall ive spent 1000\u0027s of hours in the game and still play it, so they must of done something right, if only they would add a concede vote and a region lock I would finally be able to fully enjoy the game.… ",

This game has so many negative reviews its funny lol. Its a super competitive game no one wants to lose. It is frustrating for new players because no one is good enough to solely carry a game unless they get lucky, and when they don\u0027t get lucky instead of understanding why they are losing they look to blame others. It really isnt impossible to start playing the game, it just takes patience, and dedication. They are working on making better tutorials, its pretty funny actually. But if you want to get good you need to take self interest to get better, you cant just mindlessly play the game and magically end up an amazing player.… ",

Most of them are probably written by people who are angry because they just lost a string of games or got matched with bad team-mates. Don\u0027t be put off by them. Let\u0027s make one thing clear; this game is hard. You will have to commit, and learn. When you start, you will feel completely confused and out of your depth, and you will have no idea what is going on. But you\u0027ll have some fun. By the time you get to your fourth try at a game, you\u0027re getting things together. Within a couple of weeks, you can see your progress. In 6 months, you might even be ok at the game. By a year later, you could even be good. This game takes a hell of a lot of time, because of its innate complexity and intricacy. That\u0027s what makes this game arguably the best in its genre. Not only does it have a fantastic design team led by Icefrog, not only is it completely free (aside from purely cosmetic items), but it is fascinating, intricate, and often beautiful. It is a game that will challenge you, change you, and teach you a lot about persistence and patience, as well as the value of a positive attitude and team skills. It does have its problems. The skill curve is intense, and sometimes it feels like you\u0027ve hit a wall. The people who write such negative reviews are often those who have not pushed through their current wall and chose to give up, when all they had to do was choose to learn or not be bothered by bad players. Speaking of bad players... The biggest problem is matchmaking. If you\u0027re in Europe, you will consistently be matched with Russians (since they are such a huge community) who often play on high ping and do not speak english; even when you get matched with good Russians, it is hard for them to have a significant impact due to the terrible connectivity and servers in Eastern Europe. If you\u0027re in the US, you\u0027ll have the same thing from Peru/South America and the Philippines. Be prepared for shouting teenagers, drunk/high players, people who troll, feed, afk, flame. At least one of these per game, but three or more if you\u0027re at the lowest skill levels (where you\u0027ll start off. Fun fun fun.) If you don\u0027t have a thick skin, this will get to you until you learn to have a thick skin or you leave the game. Often it\u0027s a good idea to take a break for a month or so and come back with a fresh attitude. However, this is worth it for the huge strategic depth, variety and enjoyment the game can bring (in my view). I\u0027m much more patient than I was, much calmer and slower to anger. If someone chucks an insult at me, it doesn\u0027t get to me, because it\u0027s nothing compared to feeding, screaming idiots (which actually gets funny after a short while thanks to helpless rage directed into a language they don\u0027t know by virtue of google translate. I\u0027ve seen some hilariously convoluted insults). This game is NOT for everyone, and is not for those easily angered/offended. If you are persistent and dedicated, the game will reward you for months or years with great, exciting games (yes, there are bad ones and you\u0027ll lose 50% of the time, but it\u0027s easy to forget the bad and remember the good). This is the best game I have ever played, and it has changed my view of things and my attitude for the better. It\u0027s also free, so you may as well give it a go. If you choose to stick with it, who knows, I might meet you in matchmaking some day! Good luck, have fun.… ",

I didn\u0027t play much in stacks 5vs5, but most of the times solo or with single friend. Dota 1 had excellent, skill based gameplay. It lacked decent matchmaking platform with rankings and blacklists. Player base was low therefore waiting for games was long, especially on high skill level. Engine had it drawbacks, but it didn\u0027t affect gameplay much. Also it was impossible to reconnect to the game if you suddenly lost your connection. Valve fixed lots of issues present in dota 1 and ported wonderful gameplay intact. Now we have new engine which lead to game mechanics clearance, reconnect option, fast game search and better graphics. However most important thing which was decent matchmaking platform was not provided. Currently at 5k MMR very often you get 3-4 games in a row where you can\u0027t do anything because your teammates decided to feed. If you get this type of players you are doomed. You can\u0027t kick (you could in dota 1 ex. via vote), you can\u0027t forfeit (again like in dota 1). You have to play with them for the rest of the match which is usually 30-40 minutes or else you will be punished and put in LPQ. Basically sit and suffer (what a fun!). In addition you can\u0027t blacklist those players therefore if you queue again there is high chance you will play with them again. Last thing is that matchmaking sometimes puts solo queuers against stacks (premade group of players). I don\u0027t even have to mention how unfair games like this can be. There is no visible ranking system which for me is a con. Except matchmaking I have to mention that overall game development in dota 2 was and still is very, very slow. Heroes and updates are released once in few months. There are no new maps. This is probably due to old source engine which will be replaced next year. Anyway there is no excuse. It took Valve many years for something that was made with few modders in warcraft 3. That\u0027s a shame. But you have hats, at last if you care about cosmetics. So to summarize. Wasted potential. Overall it is good old addictive dota 1 gameplay with some upgrades/downgrades around it. Still you would expect more for a sequel to such an aged game and I think overall the cons outweight the pros. In dota 1 you had to wait longer, but received quality matches. In dota 2 match quality is far worse so overall it is worse game. It is a shame and disappointment to see such a good game turned into this.… ",

I\u0027ve played other MOBAS. Dota 2\u0027s graphics are the best out of the bunch. They have a relatively higher degree of fidelity than the others. +2 (Not pushing the limits) Score: +2 Community: The Community is intense. This results in a lot of negativity directed towards those who are learning the game, trying new things etc. You also get very positive interactions due to the intensity, but it’s hit or miss. You also get a fair number of people who troll a game. This is common amongst all online games, but, due to the competitive nature, it really stands out. This game seems to bring out the best and worst of people. It is arguable that this is part of the fun. Score-3 Mechanics/controls: The Game Mechanics are Simple and easy to grasp. Mouse driven, only a few hotkeys to use in order to perform the majority of tasks and the more detailed functions are easily identifiable, and customizable. Score: +2 Complexity: Dota 2 is relatively complex compared to the other MOBAS. The trees are destructible so you can carve paths that do not normally exist, and create optimal angles for certain abilities, You can use them to escape to; the multitude of existing paths create varied and numerous ‘juking’ possibilities. You have to last hit and deny, Heroes also interact with the map in different ways, some gain vision, others have map-wide abilities etc. The degree of complexity is not for everyone. Other games cut back on complexity. It’s a play-style preference, but if you enjoy a high degree of competitiveness the complexity (you ease into it over time) is beneficial. Score +1 Content: The best thing about Dota 2 is all content that affects gameplay is free to everyone, and stays free. All pay-content or grind content is cosmetic. Sound, effects, textures, graphical aspect etc. Other games have you pay for this or grind for hundreds of hours. The WHOLE game of Dota 2 is free from the start. This is a big benefit. If one player didn’t have access to some heroes then that would be a HUGE disadvantage. Score +2 Balance: The game is very balanced. The balancing has literally taken place since 2003 when it was a mod for Warcraft 3. Many minds have balanced this. Even still, changes are made, and the game continues to improve Score +0 (Games must be balanced only negative scores possible) Valve: The parent company is a detractor in how they police the community. It assumes players are dumb and cannot police their own experience. The first time you have a muted player on your team, and you cannot properly interact with them, and lose the game you’ll understand why I bring this up as a negative. Just because other people said he’s a rude dude; doesn’t mean I would have, but I do not have the choice. I have to put up with the handicap on my team. Sure a person may just be a jerk; this should be up to me, not Valve. It is also difficult to get customer support for the game. The company is also slow to improve old hero models, and adding in missing heroes… I’m sure this is intentional to decrease their ongoing development costs. Score -3 Player base: Hit or miss, the game has dedicated roles with the various heroes. When others ignore them you’ll likely lose the match. This can be one of the most frustrating aspects about the game. You just learn to live with it, and find another game. Score -3 Heroes/items: MOBAS generally have heroes. In other games there isn’t much real difference between them. Sure they have some different abilities, but Dota 2 really differentiates these abilities, and has an added element of early/mid/late game heroes. If your team selection focuses on early play you have to do sufficient damage to the enemy early on before the other team can push into the later game where your selections are weaker. If you picked a lategame mix of heroes you have to delay the game to get to the stage of the game where your composition shines. You can also have a balanced team and that poses its own challenges. I played LOL and heroes generally scale much more consistently to the later stage of the game, where in Dota your selection plays a bigger role. Items are pretty much a universal aspect in MOBAS, and nothing any of them really stands out, so items don’t play into my score. +1 Conclusion: This is a great game. It could be a 10/10 if Valve did a little less parenting of its players, and gave us more options to police our own experiences by ourselves. Communities will always be what they are. It’s too many variables to control, and valve has tried to do this and, in my opinion, failed. This game is a LOT of fun, has tremendous replay value, and is constantly being adjusted, updated, tweaked etc. You will need patience to get past the initial harshness of the community, but when you do it’s worth it.… ",

I kept playing Dota and didn\u0027t care for any of the other clones as well (HoN, Demigod?) Then along came Dota 2. I tried that as well when it came out and didn\u0027t care for it. I went back to playing Dota. After about a year Dota 2 got better. It was just like the original but had better graphics and a control system designed for a MOBA and not an RTS. I started playing it more and more and eventually stopped playing Dota. The only game mode I was playing was ability draft. For an experienced player like myself it has the right combination of originality and skill required to play. This is where I get to how Valve has messed up with Dota 2. I am not sure if there is an over abundance of sheltered kids on Dota 2 now. I am not sure if Valve is trying to create a socialist utopia with their game. But the matchmaking system is atrocious. It is designed so that there is a 50-50 chance of each team winning. Which is just a hunch because they won\u0027t release how they match players in games. But in my thorough experience with the game that is what it feels like. In theory this is not a bad system. In theory communism works. As a player who routinely has to win games for their team and is competitive, this matchmaking system is abysmal. It basically matches up poor players with better players so they can get carried to wins. The algorithm keeps everyone around a 50% win rate regardless of how hard you try to win. In the original dota I had about a 80% win rate. This was just with random people joining a game. It also felt more natural a system. If I really wanted to win a game I could. In Dota 2 if you really want to win a game but it has matched you with crappy teammates you are screwed. After a couple of games of this happening it starts to get old. I start to get angry at my **** teammates. I can\u0027t make them better with my words but I can tell them how they suck and are wasting my time. If they have a problem with that they can mute me and report me for communication abuse. I am fine with having my chat privileges revoked even though it feels like Valve is stamping out free expression. Also If there is a mute function why do I need to have my chat privileges revoked? Anyway that has been the system and I was putting up with it. Until very recently they started putting people in the low priority pool for receiving too many reports. WTF? So if someone on the other team is beating you and you don\u0027t like it you can just report them and they will get put in the low priority pool? Why are the players given so much control on putting other players in the low priority pool? Isn\u0027t it obvious that is a **** system? And yes I know people will do that because I have reported other people before just because they beat me. Which brings me to why I wrote this review. I am currently in the low priority pool for receiving too many reports. I am not in the low priority pool because I abandoned games. I am not in the low priority pool because I was feeding. I am not in the low priority pool because I was abusing a skill. I am in the low priority pool because some **** reported me. Why should someone get put in the low priority pool for something they put in chat? This was the last straw for me personally. I have deleted the game and won\u0027t play any one of the low priority games. I have served time in low priority before for abandoning games. I didn\u0027t have a problem with that. But I feel I have to make a stand now because this is just absurd. Until Valve stops putting people in low priority for just expressing themselves I won\u0027t play their game. Heck, I might not even start playing again until they reform their atrocious matchmaking system. I am giving the game a score of 2. I would have put 0 but I did have some fun while playing ability drafts. I will change my score to an 8 if Valve reforms their matchmaking system and gets rid of communication low priority bans.… ",

There is aPlease forgive this review it is part of my desire to strengthen my reviewing prowess and is the first all multiplayer game I am reviewing. (Also MetaCritic was crashing hard when posting this) Sorry if it looks weird I couldn\u0027t get it to work so many times. Gameplay/Playability - Can I just put a 10 and call it good? I’ve never played a game with more addicting gameplay. There is a reason this Mod Birthed five games and a new genre of gaming. It is addictive. The constant updates mean that after a Six month break it will be vastly different. The game is hard, and requires time and effort but it will reward you for it. I could spend years discussing the finer side of the gameplay of this game and the way it evolves over time without breaking the surface. 10 Sound – Routinely impressive. The sound quality is great, music to fit the mood and the voice work is incredible. There are well past 90 characters each with multiple layers of voice work. Heroes in the game have lines to interact with each other as they: Walk past each other (friend or enemy), kill a hero, fight a hero and run, assist in killing a hero, survive a big attack. The spells and hero motions become so resourceful that you can react to a sound from a hero well out of sight who is en-route to murder you. Yet you hear it coming and run. Honestly the part of the game that most of the community ignores but it is such a strong factor in the gameplay. 10 Graphics – It is beautiful and graphics intense. Think WoW level of spell textures and scenery/shadows. You need some power to crank this game to full and it will be beautiful and worth it. 10 Story (Community!) – Seeing as this is multiplayer and has no story I will call this Community for this game. The community is crap, I’ve played potentially tens of thousands of hours at this point since the release of Dota Mod back in Warcraft 3. I can say without a shadow of a doubt that ever massive arrogant **** in the world is playing DOTA 2, Right Now! The game is riddled with terrible attitudes and bad sportsmanship. Your games will start with someone who sits in dead silence waiting to last pick then rages at everyone because something happened that they disagree with, these items that invoke such rage would usually be prevented with a simple amount of effort or giving a **** but they would rather stay silent and flame everyone when they don’t get there way. The developers are of no help and have done nothing to fix this issue in three years. At this point im not 100% sure this is a game, it could be a social experiment based on anonymity and arrogance. 0 Replay ability – The game is nothing if not replay-able. With matches averaging around 45 minutes there is nothing to prevent a person from sinking hours of their life into just one more match. 10… ",

At bright past this game was in beta and got update every month, Valve listen every community comment and they really tried to do game better. But what now? Now they do one of this \u0027month update\u0027 and release it semi-annually! Now they make every event pay-to-win or pay-to-play completely destroying their brilliant play-for-free system! How do you think what will be with this game in the dark future? Hope for the best. And I aware you to STAY AWAY from this game of course if you don\u0027t want to crush all of your sanity. I can recommend this game only if you will play with bots...… ",

DOTA 2 is a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) that heavily and competitively focuses on the player versus player (PvP) aspects of gaming. As the PC gameAs gamers on any platform begin to evolve, gaming becomes more than just a leisure activity, and as streaming of player versus player experiences starts to popularize, I find it is very easy to review Defense of the Ancients 2. DOTA 2 is a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) that heavily and competitively focuses on the player versus player (PvP) aspects of gaming. As the PC game develops with its impressive accumulation of unique players every month and its paucity of cons, DOTA 2 achieves the, “Best Free Online Game” award from me. I continue to invest many hours into the game for more than just one reason, merely ranging from the price to its in-depth lore, gameplay, and intense community. First thing is first, DOTA 2 is a free downloadable game you can obtain from Steam, an internet-based digital distribution, digital rights management (DRM), multiplayer, and social networking platform developed by Valve Corporation. Everyone enjoys free things, but what greatly separates this game from different and popular games is the necessity of a computer (desktop or laptop) rather than a console like a PlayStation 4 or an Xbox One. Gaming on computers and laptops is out faming the consoles simply because computers and laptops offer a much more spread out genre of video games. The only upside, in my opinion, of a console over a computer are the graphics and how cheap it is to obtain such graphics, but as beautiful and real as graphics seem on console games, DOTA 2 manages to create some vigorous and vibrant edges and textures. Instances of these tactile textures, cuts, shadowing, and rendering are the heroes or characters and the environment. The trees, rivers and even floors are covered in variances of colors shapes and sizes. Since the map of the MOBA consists of two insanely distinct sides, it is not hard to visualize the crazy and imaginative graphics on either sides of the map. So because the graphics are optical and make it easy to differentiate allies, enemies, and the actions of each means that the game is easy to play. That does not mean the game itself is easy. Not only are the graphics outstanding for this free PC game, but its gameplay is very smooth if you have a computer that can run it. The motions on the screen are compared by no other MOBA out there in addition to its skill level. Although its gameplay is easy going and greatly enjoyable by anyone, one has to master the ways of the game. The skill level required to play such a MOBA is extremely difficult to learn right away. Hours must be strictly put into DOTA 2 in order to familiarize and become comfortable with the intricate mechanics. Learning Defense of the Ancients 2 back to front will be a challenge but with commitment, rewards along the DOTA 2 path will be provided. Winning a game will become much more satisfying and random drops of player customization will pop out of nowhere. The only thing to deal with after that is the community. Any online multiplayer hosts a community in which they all vary from each other. DOTA 2’s community is a bumpy road to travel across with its intense and competitive gamers to the ignorant fools that mess up the gaming experience for everyone. Competitive players are those who do not like to joke around as they take the game very serious. DOTA 2 to a competitive player is like the law to a police officer. It is also like cancer when a competitive player meets up an ignorant child that destroys the gameplay for everyone else, but more importantly to the serious player. It is very intriguing but difficult to cross over that swaying bridge of trolls (gamers that intentionally negate the gaming experience for others) and the competitiveness of the rest of DOTA 2, but the game becomes much more enjoyable. Similar outcomes to mastering the game are achieved when getting over that bridge. This certain game also includes a neat little lore behind all the characters that may take one’s mind of the skill requirement or the annoyance the community brings for just enough time to get back into mindless gaming. It is a clear-cut to me that the writers of DOTA 2’s lore have really put some thought into its characters. Where one hero like Omniknight may support and help others, another may slice through his or her enemy with ease and without remorse like Phantom Assassin. Some characters revolve opportunistic kills that travel across the map without fault like Nature’s Prophet and others are stationary and defensive that wait for a miscalculation in opposing steps like Techies. There is one specific hero that seems quite nice and generous but is really the mastermind behind why a whole war between The Radiant and The Dire broke out. The Radiant are normal and loving human beings and animals that fight against hellish monsters and beasts known as The Dire. The objective of every game is to destroy the opposing team’s ancient. I have spent over 1500 hours on this game and to a committed player, DOTA2 nears perfection.… ",

I swear you breathe they talk, you move they talk, YOU DO ANYTHING AND THEY TALK! A massive cash cow with a million overpriced hats for each character made by the community because Valve are too lazy to make their own. Awful racist and immature community, they bash anyone from Brazil or Russia even though they can\u0027t help it because the matchmaking is atrocious and lazily thrown together. The source \"engine\" makes games look nice, but for actual GAMING it\u0027s a buggy mess which always crashes and has the worst hitboxes ever aside from Crimecrap Gangbangwars. Plus I love how fake the trailers are, the trailers make the game look intense and crazy, instead it\u0027s just who can click faster and collect the most hats! Nice false advertisement Valve! Overall this is easily one of the worst experiences I\u0027ve had in gaming, if you want to have a fun MOBA experience, play Awesomenauts or SMNC, this is the worst piece of sh*t MOBA has ever produced.… ",

So I thought I\u0027d give Dota 2 a try and have to say: What a load of garbage DotaI had fun with Dota 1 which I played for years, then tried League of Legends where I thought to myself that it had a very shallow gameplay except for the staged buying of items, the item filter and the creeping in the woods which was actually part of the game\u0027s concept as there were items specifically for this. So I thought I\u0027d give Dota 2 a try and have to say: What a load of garbage Dota 2 is ! It starts with the menus that lack ANY FORM of description what they do (tooltips anyone ?) and are NOT practical. For example: If I want to config my game I cannot press ESC or F10 to do so. Game standards, please ! Instead I have to click all the icons that have no tooltips to find what does what I want. Once I\u0027m in the config there is the same problem: Lack of helpful tooltips ! So I more or less try and - oh hey: There\u0027s the pause option which is not bound to the P or pause key ! Why even standards ? So I want to bind some stuff - but what\u0027s that ? Certain keys aren\u0027t registered for certain commands while they are for others. Well thanks a lot... There\u0027s also no warning whenever I try to use a key that\u0027s already in use by something else - again: Why even standards ? Ok so I start my first Dota 2, hero selection: I have to scroll through all of them ! What ? How about a table of all heroes to filter by one or more categories ? I\u0027m also allowed to filter by hero name and their assigned role but not whether I want an agility, strength or intellect hero. Thanks again... So after selecting my hero I\u0027m stuck in a hero outfit screen which is literally just for optics. That screen doesn\u0027t explain what\u0027s going on or I am supposed to do to proceed. Solution: Click the button with the hero name on it TWICE to actually get into the game. Horrible menu design ! Tooltips ! Explain what\u0027s going on ! For first time users: Guide me ONCE or make your menus less **** ! So I\u0027m in the game. Everything looks modern but ****. Well, never mind. I\u0027m here for the gaming experience. The game: Currently it\u0027s designed to proceed so fast that games last very short compared to Dota 1. Everything that had some cooldown, mana costs, less damage etc. is now designed to make the game proceed far faster. What happened to turn rates ? What happened to cast animations ? Etc. ... The game has been designed to have no flow that allows for anything but constant hero kills. You know what ? **** this garbage, I uninstalled it. If given the choice I\u0027d rather play League of Legends and far, far, faaar before that (because it\u0027s crap, too) I\u0027d just stay at Dota 1, because it\u0027s far more playable, far better configureable and far less **** designed. Oh and I almost forgot to mention the shop: When clicking on an item that can be part of a crafting set to upgrade to a better item the game doesn\u0027t show me that. Instead I have to KNOW that this item exists, to click on that and only then the menu will show me the reagents for that completed item. Menu design again... If something is part of certain recipes just add that to the item\u0027s info and not only to the completed recipe\u0027s info ! Such a moronic design... Item filters are also garbage. League of Legends does this better by miles. And how about a key config overlay to have vendor hotkeys for certain items ? Or are there some already ? Because the game didn\u0027t show me. It\u0027s nice to offer a tutorial for Dota 2 but either offer specific translations or use text info. And as matter of fact: Explaining doesn\u0027t work well the way Dota 2 explains things: A lot, fast, only once, with no way to repeat anything without having to restart all over again and sometimes not cleary hinting what is what. While Dota has always been about hero killing and tower roaming the increased game flow turns that in such a shallow game that this is not like any of the original Dota - except for the items in the game. If you like it: Well then keep your **** and stay as far away as possible with that badly designed garbage from me, be happy with it and don\u0027t bother me with claiming it\u0027s Dota because it\u0027s not. This is just killparty turbo which is what I loathe League of Legends for. Dota 1 understood tactics, neither League of Legends nor Dota 2 do. It\u0027s all just pew pew fast game. Next one. How about a longer lasting quality game, like Dota1 used to be ? This game should\u0027ve never been made. The only good thing of it is the absence of orb effects and buff placers which is also a bad thing as this shouldn\u0027t have been lifted to 100% for everyone because that actually added some depth into Dota 1 - along with cast animations, attack animations, turn rates, projectile speeds that weren\u0027t ridiculously fast and a game flow that would allow planning on a basic level.… ",

The only reason you \"think\" the other games are updating themselves is because you didn\u0027t play dota to begin with. This being said, dota 2 lets you use every hero in the game without paying, so that also nullifies the money hungry argument as every other game makes you purchase any new hero, and that hero is overpowered for about a month, so isn\u0027t that pay to win whereas dota\u0027s system is absolute fairness? The only thing you can purchase in the game is cosmetics, Whereas in LoL you can buy runes and different abilities to supplement the characters you also had to pay for. Dota 2 offers everything you could want, a bug free game that is completely free to play and you can be as competitive as you want, you can play as much as you want, you can try any hero you want. Without paying a dime. And you\u0027ll have a good time as long as you are actually trying to enjoy and get to know the game and everyone that plays it will encourage you to do so. The bad reviews on this site come from people who are bad at games in general or from diehard LoL fans that can\u0027t stand that their game is a shadow of the original and now an even uglier shadow in the face of the new Dota.… ",

Bugs are almost non-existant and you get free rewards every few games, all heroes are free. What more could you with for? The reason this isn\u0027t 10/10 I think has to be with last hitting, which while allows to make difference between bad and good players in lane, it is also tedious and not really rewarding thing.

I\u0027ll admit there are some cool stuff in Dota 2 but with all thoseI\u0027m not going to talk about Russians or even Reborn. The game itself is the **** game but somehow it makes me want to play more. Why I think Dota 2 sucks but I still play it; [in short] Slow and laggy controls, full ripoff roster (mainly from Warcraft 3), extremely long matches, toxic community, last hits, kill steals... I\u0027ll admit there are some cool stuff in Dota 2 but with all those things mentioned, I shouldn\u0027t play this damn thing should I? It doesn\u0027t feel fun when I play it, even with friends it feels like a boring chore. But I still play it, why? Well, here is the list on why I believe Dota 2 makes me play itself [details below]; 1 - Friends. Playing with friends is fun, sometimes... They invite me over every once in a while, which prevents me from uninstalling the game. 2 - Item drops, seems cool but it creates an illusion of hope. Even though my conscious mind know that it won\u0027t drop anything of value, it still has an effect. 3 - That feeling in the end of the match, if I win it feels AWESOME,like I actualy did something good with my life, like I accomplished something. But actually I didn\u0027t and it was a waste of time. 4 - The game runs like butter on my PC. For example Heroes of the Storm is 10 times better than Dota 2 but HotS runs at like 20-30 fps, Dota 2 runs at 50-60 fps. 5 - Heroes in Dota 2 are extremely well done. Their dialogues, appearences, costumes, abilities, hero combos etc. are frikin\u0027 amazing. But they are all ripped of from WC3, SC2 and D3. These were actually good stuff about Dota 2, what is so bad about it that makes me HATE Dota 2? 1 - Controlls are really, I mean really bad. Missclicks happen all the time because of how small hitboxes are compered to for example HotS. People think turn rate is a good thing but it makes the game extremely slow and sluggish. Summoned, enchanted etc. units don\u0027t have a mind of their own... They can\u0027t cast their abilities on their own... I\u0027m not a baby sitter man, I want to play a game, micromanagement sucks in this game. It\u0027s unnacceptable for me because for example in HotS my summoned units have AI and can act on their own. I just point the right way. 2 - No original character. Almost all abilities and heroes are ripped off mainly from Warcraft III. It\u0027s so bad in fact, when Blizzard started to make HotS, they had to kindly ask Valve to change some of the heroes names and desings. Everyone knows about Windranger, Wraith King and Venomancer... Slyvanas from WCIII, Skeleton King from D3 and Abathur from Starcraft II. 3 - Farming and it\u0027s boring necessities; last hitting is a boring chore, if that\u0027s not enough I have to deny enemy from farming as much as possible. 4 - With all these boring chore going on, I don\u0027t want the game to last 45-60 mins. Competing games such a Smite and HotS matches only take 30 at worst. 5 - Comminity and it\u0027s toxicity. I hate when people tell me what items to buy and do it in most toxic way. Such as \"look at this ♥♥♥♥, look which items he bought on his hero LOL\". I hate it when people lose their SHET if I accidentaly KS. People go nuts when if I accidentaly get a last hit as a support. Opposing team can be a pain in the ♥♥♥, unpausing the game for example is a big problem. I hate it when I see my own friends go crazy on this game. I hate myself when I find myself yelling at my friends for this CRAP game. I\u0027m not even mentioning Russian players right now... I don\u0027t want to play this game ever again. I hope HotS will get a decend optimisation soon so that I don\u0027t have to even consider wasting my time on this garbage.… ",

Honestly, I feel restricted, I feel like I\u0027m playing in a box and it makes the pace feel slow. I have to praise it\u0027s item and stat system though. There are a of items with interesting actives. Also leads don\u0027t mean a lot, you can come back from anything and with buy-back unlike other MOBAs which have many games which are drawn out, boring, predictable, sometimes just a facepalm montage and tedious to play. This game has had tons of time and alterations so I doubt the balance is bad. I felt like I really wasn\u0027t giving it enough credit because I didn\u0027t enjoy it… ",

Some days will have a 10mb update which is so good, then here comes the day where it updates at nearly 300mb and another day which updates a harsh fit of 1gb which is very frustrating to players who have a very slow internet connection. Overall this game is very good game, with it\u0027s mechanics and gameplay, a player can\u0027t argue no more. I give this game a rating of 8/10. Till next time, Game on!… ",

I\u0027ve played this game since it was invite only with beta keys post TI 1 and the quality of games and the community has done nothing but go down after each growth spike. Valve, the developers of dota 2 make tens of millions annually from cosmetics and crowd funded prize pool, but they don\u0027t even have a community manager. There is no way to know if your complaints are being heard and most go unnoticed. There are descriptions of items and hero spells in the game that are flat out wrong and at worse misleading that have never been fixed. The UI keeps getting worse and worse as valve hides everything important under sub menus and makes advertising take precedent. If you aren\u0027t planning on being a professional dota 2 player don\u0027t even bother with this title, there is very little that is worthwhile or redeemable about this game.… ",

They have completely ruined my favorite game of the last decade. Well played Valve! If you do wish to have fun, you must find four players of your EXACT skill level, no variance whatsoever. And you must only play with them. If even one is missing expect a poor match. Since finding four players at your exact level and only playing with a full team is virtually impossible you\u0027re pretty much hosed. Expect 90% of games to be blowouts one way or the other. I find LoL to be the brain-dead version of DOTA, but they at least got the matchmaking system right, so unfortunately it\u0027s LoL from here on out.… ",

Dota 2 is extremely poorly made in every single aspect, from necessary internet needed which is absurd to PS2 graphics that require a super computer to work (which got better after going to source 2 and being COMPLETELY REMADE) the designs of the heroes are mostly over simplified ripoffs of Warcraft 3 characters, and some of them like Arc Warden look so awful you can do nothing but laugh when looking at them. The animation of the creeps attacking is the most boring and uninspired thing I\u0027ve ever seen, they look bored, and so do you after seeing it, its like they are pretending to fight and not actually fighting. Maybe Valve could learn a thing or two from Blizzard\u0027s animations, if you are going to rip them off so much. The game is filled with bugs which are sometimes \"fixed\", the game barely works, and is so pathetically unbalanced it makes Final Fantasy Tactics look like a masterpiece of balancing. The game\u0027s outcome is rarely ever decided through skill or strategy, and mostly by luck, or who happens to have the most overpowered heroes at that specific match. Some heroes like Invoker are purposely overpowered to make them stand out because he is \"hard\" to use compared to other heroes, it is one of the most used heroes in professional games and high rank games, because of how utterly broken he is. The luck is one of the most important factors of Dota 2, which is a joke for a \"competitive\" \"\"\"action\"\"\" game. Most heroes have at least one ability based on RNG, and a lot of the items are also based on it, with a chance of everything happening. How can you take seriously a game which has a 15% chance of dealing x4.5 times the attack\u0027s damage? Or a passive that grants you a chance of using your spells 4 **** times? It is retarded to watch a \"professional\" game where the most important team fight is decided because the alchemist got a stun with the basher 3 times. Clearly all items and abilities which are RNG based could be modified to be turned into a strategic, situational things, but I guess randomness is extremely popular with Dota 2 players (and stupid people in general) it is easier to see competition in League of Legends games, and that is saying something. The balancing is obviously determined by which hero is used or not by the \"pros\", if the pros don\u0027t like a hero, expect it to be buffed until it is so insufferably overpowered it ruins the game simply by existing, then the \"pros\" will start to use it, which is when it starts to get nerfed again. This includes heroes who are mostly RNG-based, so expect x10 crits in the future updates. The game have like, 3 songs total, you will listen to the same **** song every match, everytime, and the same song in the title screen (Valve managed to fix this monotony by making music another item that you can get by giving them money, isn\u0027t that great?) Don\u0027t expect to play with players in the same level, even though they do collect info about you and have a hidden MMR for public matches, expect to see brilliant players being set with noobs who clearly never played heroes which are not Riki or Wraith King. Watch as terrible players win games and great players lose, because of how unbalanced the game is and how stupidly the teams are formed (Valve thinks the average of the players\u0027 MMR are what matters). Matches take more than 3 minutes to be found, which is a joke compared to other online games, even the ones made by smaller companies. But hey, I can deal with awful players and unbalances just fine (and exploit them like everyone else) but Valve\u0027s **** servers are the straw that broke the camel\u0027s back, I am not going to ever play this garbage for a very long time now, and you better fix these servers instead of making more stupid \"cosmetics\". I would rather play a game that **** works. Overall, this game is garbage, don\u0027t waste your time (and money). Or go play Heroes of the Storm… ",

Which brings me back to #2 7- Tutorial is horribly incomplete. 8- When you finish the first tutorial the next tutorial should be highlighted and not greyed out. Letting the player know the next tutorial is active. Causes confusion. Basic rule 101 9-Have a life? Have kids? Need not play this game then. This is not for a casual gamer. The game is Pro no life having players need only apply aka teenager. Or you will be banned. 10- Don’t have a good internet connection 100% of the time need not apply. You will be banned. 11- No ranking servers just farm the new guy all day long. 12- No rankings 13- Game promotes irresponsible behavior, like the guy who left his kid in the car to go to the strip club. Can u imagine your kid having to choose being banded from a game because he made the right decision or take the irresponsible path and be able to keep playing? 14- This game is fit for abuse, if you want to be a prick just thumbs down people all day, they will be banned. The makers think kids are mature and not going to abuse that feature. 15- Controls are all wrong, you need to be able to move your guy and cast and look around the area so you don’t get ganked but can’t why because the idiot creators used you w,s,a,d keys as spell keys instead of maneuvering your guy/guys. Game creation lv geniuses {{insert sarcastic tone here}} 16- Zoom control sucks, cant back it up far enough. 17- Their check off list on the tutorial makes it looks like that thier is more to that chapter that needs to be completed, but you are unable to access it. As far as I can tell it’s not the case. What it may actually be is what is covered during that chapter and you are starting at x point even though you can’t skip or change the mark. This bugs the hell out of me. 18- There is a pause somewhere saw someone use it. It could be useful on the Bot tutorials if it was located on the typical keys but isn’t.… ",

If you want a more casual experience with a less steep learning curve you should play LoL. If you never played a Moba before and want to start with an easier dumbed down version, play HotS. In all other cases, i highly recommend to stick to the original of the genre. A problem within almost all games of the Moba genre is the toxic and unforgiving community of teenagers and russians.

I have been on-and-off with this game ever since its beta status in \u002711-\u002712. I remember in my very first game, I picked and played Axe. Because I was brand new to the game, I had to also endure the annoying typings of angry teammates. Just from the flamers it took me months to even bother trying again. Ever since Valve\u0027s takeover of this title, the pattern seems to be letting the game sit stagnant until the pro scene did something to prompt immediate (and often heavy-handed) balance changes. There are an absurdly high number of characters to choose from, and because of that players are often expected to fulfill a \"role\", or subset of heroes that will work well in a job for each game. Mastery is attainable, but not after thousands of hours grinding and learning as you go. Some of that knowledge is even rendered useless on the occasional patch when heroes, items get reworked or released. In the ideal, games would go for 30-45 minutes before being done but there is no real cap meaning if you stalemate you could see yourself being stuck in this game for a lot longer. The punishment systems are a joke as well. Valve seems to think that they can monitor a community without actual moderators. Instead, you have a fully-automatic system in place that punishes people based on how many people rage-reported them. This player could have not done anything legitimately wrong, but would still get punished under the right conditions. Leaving / AFK\u0027ing a match guarantees punishment as well which is harsh for anyone who is liable to be interrupted during the game or doesn\u0027t want to waste another 10-20 minutes for the enemy to wipe their team for the 15th time and end it. Dota is also one of the only games I know that has a huge amount of fanaticism. Any complaints no matter the legitimacy are often met with posters trying so hard to deflect the blame onto the complainer. Dunning-Kruger has even become a household term for lazy fanboys of this game. The counter-criticisms sometimes go away when issues are proven correct... but there will always be very vocal and swift response to laments like \"this game sucks.\" The graphics and the character customization are great points for this game. To be honest, it\u0027s hard to collect and enjoy hats in this game because of everything else weighing it down. Overall, this is a miserable experience that you should take a pass on. I\u0027ve had friends try this game and quit within weeks. I\u0027ve had to take extended breaks, some of which I thought I was quitting the game \"for good.\" This was hard to do at first because of the game\u0027s F2P accessibility, but it\u0027s gotten a lot easier with glaring problems like unsolved bugs, balance issues, and toxic community remaining prevalent for so long. Don\u0027t play DotA 2. It looks nice, but it\u0027s absolutely unrewarding unless you\u0027ve already established yourself as a world-class player.… ",

Mistakes will get you screamed at and insulted by the other players, too, because the community is very toxic. I think maybe if you can grind through all that data, and keep on getting punished for hundreds of hours on end, at the end you can become a decent DOTA player and maybe, have some fun. But I have 800 hours, mostly pulled in by my friends, and I have to say, I had decent fun twice maybe, for brief moments. But hey, it\u0027s free to play.… ",

The game is fun to play casually but is more fun to play in a competitive setting or even watch the pros playing. It feels like an art of war when the teams are trying their best to outpick or outplay the other team.

The game is fun to play casually but is more fun to play in a competitive setting or even watch the pros playing. It feels like an art of war when the teams are trying their best to outpick or outplay the other team. Playing in a group of five is just waaaaay more fun than playing by yourself. 2. Free to play. You can play 111 heroes right off the start. It can be a bit overwhelming at first and people tend to end up playing a pool of 20 heroes that fits their playing style, but it gives you the freedom to play whoever you want unlike most other games. However, you have to pay for the skins, which people tend to spend a lot of money on. 3. Game is constantly improving. We can see the effort of Valve in developing new game engine, new game features, new game settings, the balance of heroes, and the balance of each roles. For example, as of patch 6.86, I can see that the role of supports are much more important and more fun than when I first started to play (patch 6.68?). Cons 1. Very sharp learning curve. As I said, people can get overwhelmed by the amount of heroes that are accessible at the beginning and it takes a looong time to figure out what each hero is and what their skills are. 2. Unfriendly community. The pub community is just extremely toxic (either in NA or China). It frustrate me a lot, like a lot.… ",

The players whom make money from tournaments, provide income for valve in the tune of + $80,000,000 or more per year. Has Valve given them the green-light? Boosting services advertise on Valves site and Twitch streams. Valve knows who it is and does not stop them. Not sure why I still play as I have been walked all over. This next part is brilliant! Boosters then offer a service to remove the low priority. Therefore, valve has done nothing to change the toxicity of the community, but made it worse by a) allowing the boosters to make money messing up the ranking and causing more toxicity b) providing the boosters more business. If you are a new player to this game you will be reported and end up in low priority. People report because of the toxicity, the unfair matchmaking system which leads to frustration and a great deal of anger toward MMR. All this created by Valve and its broken system that is focused on greed and making money. Making money is a good thing, but not at the expense of your customers, fans, and supporters.… ",

The game has a very tough learning curve, and if you want to be AVERAGE. not good, but AVERAGE. You better be prepared to say goodbye to a few days (realtime) in cumulative hours. You have 100+ heroes to pick from, and each of them comes with their own unique playstyle and skillset. After 300+ hours I still haven\u0027t played every hero in the game. Gameplay wise, every match is different and unique, even though it happens to be on the same map. This keeps it fresh constantly. This is because of all of the different hero picks and item builds you can have on your heroes, and the different players behind the screen. The User interface for this game is also incredible, especially with the steam guides, You can subscribe to a steam guide in the steam overlay, click a book in the top left corner, and suddenly the shop transforms into the items you need for the guide already their, and the skills you need to level up where and when highlight and come up in the order you need to level them. This is great for beginners and people who want to try a new hero without sucking straight away. It is also highly interesting to watch professional games and see how they do it.

Я спокойно могу обойтись месяц без игры, но почему-то тянет сыграть хоть иногда, не знаю, когда закончу играть.

Now Dota 2 is no longer Dota. All competitive factors are lost and its greatness is lost due to greed. Small example; player HUD used to be same size for all heroes, now it changes from hero to hero covering more or less screen space thus making it unequal. Entire patch was made to decrees skill needed to play aka pro plays are less rewarding. I don`t blame Icefrog I guess he got tricked. Rip Dota, it was safer in Blizzards hands...… ",

You get to spend all your gold on your unappreciative team and you suffer from low gold and XP gain as a result which results in feeding which results in you becoming the focal point of your team\u0027s malice. Rather than try to fix this, Valve just keeps buffing the carry heroes who are easy to play and own with. This is because their popularity creates revenue in skin sales. Patch 7 means that with talents you now have to lvl up ver quickly to stay relevant which just encourages more afk farming and less teamplay. It\u0027s a \u0027team\u0027 game that valve are intent on fostering into environment where no one plays as a team. That\u0027s because all they care about is now is £££ - a real shame for a game created initially because of the passion of modders. oh and the New hero Monkey King is a joke - every spell OP and is essentially the kind of hero that would be created by the most cancerous, carry playing Dota player you can conceive of.… ",

    "comments": "So after playing and having fun on LoL for a long while, I thought to myself, \"why not try out some other cool new MOBA games for a change?\" So I did. And of course I started immediately with DoTA 2. And see, before you think I\u0027m just being biased and trying to nitpick this game simply because I\u0027m a LoL fan, trust me, I\u0027m not. It\u0027s just that I genuinely think this is a bad game based onSo after playing and having fun on LoL for a long while, I thought to myself, \"why not try out some other cool new MOBA games for a change?\" So I did. And of course I started immediately with DoTA 2. And see, before you think I\u0027m just being biased and trying to nitpick this game simply because I\u0027m a LoL fan, trust me, I\u0027m not. It\u0027s just that I genuinely think this is a bad game based on my experience. So, before getting into the actual gameplay, I should point out the characters and matchups. First off, this might be a venial thing to point out, but what is up with the characters\u0027 names? Like seriously, it\u0027s quite obvious that the developers just named them directly after their concept. Names like \"Fire Knight\" \"Bloodseeker\" and \"Enchantress\" aren\u0027t exactly what I would call innovative. And why are ALL the characters 100% free to play? Like, it may seem like a really cool feature for some people, but really it\u0027s quite unnecessary. Like, if you really like a certain character, then you should be able to work toward it and make enough money to purchase the character with in-game currency, not just join the game for the first time and have all the characters at your fingertips. What makes this even more stupid is the unbalanced roster. The characters are either really OP or flat-out useless. And the gameplay. It\u0027s already unpleasant, repetitive and boring because, as I said before, the roster of heroes is totally out of balance. But there are another features that bland it even more. I might be most thought of as a scrub for saying this, but why is there no autolock? Like yeah, I get it, if you watch the world championships or DoTA 2 or LoL, you\u0027ll notice the players aren\u0027t using autolock. But I\u0027m speaking from the perspective of a casual, new player in DoTA 2, which I\u0027m sure is why most people are reading this review. Again, this may seem very venial, but it\u0027s a pretty big issue, for me at least. Every time I move my mouse to cast an ability on an enemy, my screen display gets shoved forward, and by the time I\u0027ve returned to my hero the enemy player has already slaughtered me. So then I try to keep it on my hero by consistently keeping my thumb pressed on the spacebar, and by the time the match is over my thumb hurts like hell. Overall, DoTA 2 has greatly disappointed me.… ",

The matchmaking rework is a welcome change and puts less weight on a specific mmr value and more on an overall experience by rewarding players with tiered badges.

Valve tried to get rid of toxic players after I complained but they fail always because its hard to get rid of them literally. I rate it 9/10 because there is something missing in the game like an admin who monitors the report, players who can\u0027t stop being a hater or a person who is \"addicted to drugs\u0027 and starts trashtalking to you even tho you didn\u0027t do anything wrong like feed the team and stuff, they just randomly start saying crap and you\u0027re forced to mute and the game lacks out of beauty.… ",

As a beginner you will get overinformed. Unfortunately the tutorial is too short, maybe 15 minutes and you still dont know how to use the courier, how to build a strategy for your hero and so on. Positively you can say, the game is complex and you need a lot of time to get into it and understand every detail, what is necessary, because your enemies know them. So this is another aspect of the game: in the beginning you will die very often, what is frustrating. I would like to know, how the match making is programmed, I saw only few newbies in my games. One last thing I dont like in this game: the camera is too near to the heroes and it lacks good overview. This was a nightmare already in Warcraft 3, here it is better, but still a problem. Enough of negative aspects, this game is surely very good. There are a over 100 heroes and many items to build up a strategy. You have only 4 abilities, so this is not so complex. And there is only 1 map (why?). So you need to focus on your hero and which item to buy, but this is enough to spend hours building a hero and there are many of them. The community? In average I had 1 idiot every 10 games. The best thing you can do is ignore such kids and report them. I wrote about E-Sport already, and I need to write more about it. This part is very well implemented: you can watch replays from tournaments live or download them. The replays are perfect, because you have so many possibilities there. It is a big entertainment.… ",

Como te puedes encontrar a gente cabeza hueca que con una sola Team Fight que salga mal comienzan a escribir GG, se rinden, prenden el microfono para insultar, te encuentras con un Gringo de los odiosos y empiezan **** mexican\u0027 \u0027Taco\u0027, Feeders, pickers Techies en Rankeds sin saberlo jugar. * Partidas largas de +40 excesivas y estresantes, Tú puedes dominar la partida teninendo un gran control de la lineas wars en el mapa pero si eres support y tienes la mala suerte de que te toquen aliados con cero poder de push o bien no saben el momento adecuado de entrar a base enemiga es un dolor de cabeza llegar high ground tú o tus compañeros empiezan a morir les terminas dando más oro y la ventaja que se tenia en items probablemente se termine perdiendo si el team enemigo se llega a recuperar preparate para que el tiempo se haga infinito.… ",

Я в доте наЯ иду к твоей мамаше в гости. Иди парниша погуляй. Мои яйца две тараски и мой куй как батерфляй. В доте я за кери круче всех фармлю, К сороковой минуте 25 крипов я точно завалю. Сколько не играю в доту, я ваши нави и альянсы как бомжей последних нагибаю. Причем играю против них ногами. Пару тапков закупил, решил имбу проверить, играю без ульты, котла я собираю в кери. Я в доте на своем горбу тяну всех раков. Ты жалкий изи бот. ЛИЦО ТВОЕЙ БАБУЛИ С ТУАЛЕТОМ ПЕРЕТУТАЛ КОТ. Тяжко на инвокере играть ногами занимаясь ****ом с твоей мамой. При этом попадать санстрайком и фармить + я обкурился планом. За шторма я делаю рампаге, ультой летаю словно пуля Рапира и два тапка закуп, ноги же две кули. Ты вайперу купил ботинок сцука конченый ты рак, у него нет ног. КУДА ОН БУДЕТ ОДЕВАТЬ ЭТОТ ЕПУЧИЙ ТАПОК? Что такое дота2, там играют лишь бомжи, одни телки, школьники и быдло, Ты тимплей мне покажи. Я реально окуел от волв, ради бабок и пиара доту сделали для новичков. Вот тебе пример, играет за никса очередной епучий рак И меня спросил внезапно КТО ТАКОЙ АНУБ\u0027АРАК. На айкапе на высоком рейте там реально лютые инвокеры и тимы, А вы долбаные снайперы, траксы и рики просто проходите мимо. Запускаю сканер раков, у кого же ****ха мама. Это уже урса, пол часа игры прошло, а он ни разу не убил рошана. Первый закуп тапок, вот и собран рак на мид, а потом удивляется Почему ему все пишут, где сс и ганги ***ор. Вот еще вам парни раковый подгон. За квопу качают третий скилл и собирают ей дагон. За гондонами и смазкой я иду в аптеку (Слыш Primera а зачем?)

Бабы в доте меня бесят, как пацаны хотят катать, габону новичкам осталось только **опу подтирать. Если девушка играет в доту то она богиня и в команде она идол. Так думает каждый избитый в школе малолетний пи***р Когда учился я играть, то гайдов не было и дота было на английском. Было тяжело но с ботами я научился быстро. Ведь описание трудно прочитать и в чате пацаны не дрючили особо чью-то мать. Учил играть друзей, они меня учили И НИКАКИЕ НАВИ НАХОЙ НЕ НУЖНЫ НАМ БЫЛИ. Открою вам секрет, до доты2 про денди никуя никто не знал. Один игру не вытащишь и вместе с раками приходится на брудершафт сосать. Потренируйтесь с ботами, куски гумна **** вашу мать.… ",

IF u are someone who has at least 3 or more friends already into this game from some time then by all means this game is for people like you, with friends who know a thing or two about this game u will really enjoy it.... and U will also pick up the aspects of the game faster BUTTT BUT BUT If u are a solo gamer with not a lot of time and no real avid gamer buddies JUST AVOID this game completely because Trust me this game will make u feel more worthless than anyone ever can actually make u feel !!! The game is highly imbalanced when SOLO pairing you with team mates.... Excessively Steep Learning Curves to heroes almost bordering on carpel tunnel levels of physical stress along with Mental stress equivalent to punching holes in your Screen and Keyboard and Mouse Destroying Level of Team Support (P.S. Trust me i have broken a dozen mouses and at least 3 keyboards in my playtime) !!!! In conclusion Dota is, I would not say GOOD GAME as it is excessively Unfriendly to New Gamers.... But it is a competent Game Nonetheless !!!! I do recommend this game albeit with conditions..... 2 or more friends already Dota Players and thousands of hours of free time to pump into Severe Mental and after some time actual Physical Agony !!… ",

Лучшая игра своего жанра в плане графики, механик, удобности и скорости подбора игроков. Графически очень проработанная игра с чётко прорисованными героями, текстурами карты со всем её вытекающим наполнением. Геймплей игры завязывается на добиваниях крипов, убийстве героев соперников и основной цели - уничтожения трона врагов. Персонажей много, каждый имеет собственные уникальные механики, в комбинациях между которыми можно не только успешно провести файт(драку), но и насладится красочным визуальным представлением. Для игроков нашедших игру интересной, есть рейтинговый матчмейкинг где можно повышать свой уровень игры и подниматься по рейтингу к более сильным игрокам. Если достичь определенного высокого рейтинга, есть шанс попасться на глаза к профессиональным командам и связать отрезок своей жизни с киберспортом. Дота является самой высокооплачиваемой игрой среди киберспортивных дисциплин, благодаря чему имеет высокий интерес среди молодежи желающей зарабатывать деньги играя. Среди конкурентов по популярности можно выделить лишь Лигу Легенд, которая по моему субъективному мнению проигрывает мультяшной комиксной графикой, не особо удобным лаунчером и магазином с непонятными для новоиспеченных игроков : рунами, талисманами и прочими лишними объектами.… ",

Honestly though, contrary to popular opinionDotA 2 is like a good game of chess that has done acid and decided to invite all of its \u0027friends\u0027 over to brutalize and torment the other team. However, instead of tormenting the other team these \u0027friends\u0027 just decide to rail on one another until each \u0027friend\u0027 has to quietly put themselves into offline mode before playing any game on steam. Honestly though, contrary to popular opinion DotA is a very fun game. It is just not a fun game for stupid people or people that are not willing to take some time to learn the game. This game will not spoonfeed you on how to play, nor will it easily allow you to catch up if you make mistakes. Like in the real world if you make mistakes in battle you will suffer. A few tips: Try to keep a level head, and bonus points for a positive attitude. Your team will appreciate it a lot, and they will be more willing to work with you. Pay attention to the map, your surroundings, and your enemies items. Read your abilities carefully, read the patch notes, read the items abilities. Practice heroes in demo mode (this is different from bot practice or private lobby.) Get yourself a mic. Effective communication is one of your biggest utilities. If a hero that is in your lane goes missing call missing immediately. Better safe than sorry. Buy wards. Wards might typically be a supports \u0027job\u0027, but they will save your life and get you kills, which will easily make up for the gold cost. Also, your team will appreciate you that much more, which will result in them being much more likely to try to help you out and listen to you. Use your scan. I find that this tool is way overlooked. At least in my bracket. It\u0027s up every 5 minutes, and it can only help (if not to tell you where someone is; it will tell you where they are not.) Nobody is good at DotA. There is always someone much better than you are. So do your best and try not to talk trash. Treat this as a chance to develop team communication skills Deny creeps as much as you can, but not at the sacrifice of missing a last hit. Buy smoke before a gank or a Rosh kill. They are a cheap invaluable tool. Verbally tell whomever you are around if you are planning on leaving them or TPing out. Experiment with different items when you are fighting different types of heroes. I say this last one with caution because it can hinder your ability to play the game normally, but try Turbo when you first start out. It will allow you to learn heroes more quickly. Okay, actually this is my last point. Try to have fun. It is just a game. Your mostly non-toxic Dota friend, Havoc Octavian Teslasmith… ",

Постоянно происходят разные отрубания от сервера, ошибки. До покупки SSD игровой кэш прогружался перед первой картой вплоть до пяти минут. Одна из причин - растущий день ото дня список из отвратных косметических предметов. Второй минус - это сомнительный баланс. Многих героев с переменной частотой смешивают с дерьмом. И самое возмутительное - то, что здесь хорошая игра и победа идут вразрез. Блядская мета с героями, которые выиграют тебе игру если ты их пикнешь. То есть тут побеждает не тот, кто выкладывается на максимум на подходящем герое, а тот, кто взял метового говномеса и делает всё по инструкции, придуманной кем-то совершенно нездоровым. Третий минус. Матчмейкинг и не работающая система наказаний. В подборе игр участвует множество негласных переменных. Кроме рейтинга порядочности, о участии которого в подборе гадские разрабы ДО ПОСЛЕДНЕГО скрывали, в игре есть скрытый рейтинг. Тот, по которому подбираются игры в обычном и турбо-режиме, но который ПОЧЕМУ—ТО также учитывается при подборе рейтинговых игр. Сука, да это, блять, гениально! Просто понижаем последний винрейт в не-рейтинговых играх, а потом отбиваем его в рейтинге. Я так с рыцаря до легенды доабузил, правда после такого всё дольше и дольше ищет игру. В игре невообразимый для обычного игрока входной порог. Чтобы немножко, на базовом уровне научиться играть в эту игру, нужно провести в ней от 1000 часов чистого времени. И планка постоянно растёт, уровень игры на 5000 ММР в 2014 это примерно 3000 ММР сейчас, в 2018. Вдобавок к этому игра очень жёстко наказывает за ошибки, из-за чего игрок проигрывающей стороны может в итоге до 20 минут за игру (игра - 45 минут) просидеть \"в таверне\", беспомощно наблюдая как падает его база. А если в начале игры тебя или твоего тиммейта убили пару раз, ты будешь ощущать это на себе ВСЮ ОСТАВШУЮСЯ ИГРУ. А матчи в этой игре длятся в среднем от 20 до 90 минут. И всё это время ты будешь жалеть, что вообще начал. Резюмируя всё вышесказанное, Dota 2 — игра с худшими левацкими идеями, перенесёнными в игровые механики. Финальная оценка - 0/10.… ",

My 7/10 games had always a booster or smurfing, it was so unplayable to my account. And last is teammates were always brain dead, couldn\u0027t properly draft or what\u0027s the right pick. GG.",
