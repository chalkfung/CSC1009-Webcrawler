I know some people who play LOL might bash in this game, but both games are compleatly different. Its like comparing COD and Battlefield, they are so different that connot be compared. (no preference on either game, I think bot of them are good) Give this game a try, the learning curve is very steep but it is rewarding when you learn. I think this is the best gave valve has ever developed and has been the most played game on steam ever since the second year of beta development. Try it out, its free and badass!… Expand",

If you already play LoL and want something more challenging and more rewarding then by all means try Dota 2. Plus it has way better graphics, great character customization and doesn\u0027t require any money to unlock heroes (which I find very frustrating in LoL). It is also more balanced imo. As for the community, well it\u0027s still a MOBA so don\u0027t expect too much, although it\u0027s not so bad.… Expand",

For the most part any hero in the game is capable of defeating any other hero in the game if the two players are equally skilled. It\u0027s very balanced in that respect. It is also a fun game if you can get past the culture, attitude, arrogance, and hostility that people bring to the game. That problem is it\u0027s very hard to get past that part. This game is full of the most hateful, immature, ignorant people you will ever find in any MMO game, period. I played WoW for over a year, I played SW: TOR, I have played several random \"web-based\" games where you also expect the bottom of the barrel in terms of users and community, but every horrid online community I\u0027ve ever seen pales in comparison to this. You may think I\u0027m exaggerating, but if you can put 10-20 hours into this game without being called newb, baddie, or told to go kill yourself/uninstall, then I\u0027m envious of you. That doesn\u0027t even cover the harassment and berating you will receive from your own team no matter how new you are, or how hard you are trying. If you make a mistake prepare to pay for it in hateful comments from your own team, up to and including calling you every imaginable name over mic and in chat. The majority of players on US servers at certain times are foreign and cannot speak English, and Valve has decided to ignore this problem and believe me, it\u0027s a huge problem in a game that requires communication which only adds to the overall hate and frustration level. Russians are the biggest problem on US servers right now and if you happen to offend one of them, regardless of which team this person is on, they will almost certainly ask the other Russians in the game, again regardless of team, to report you. You have no recourse and the process is semi-automated. You will receive mutes from Valve after you accumulate enough reports the validity of which makes no difference. I have just spent two paragraphs warning you of what you are getting into, while only devoting one paragraph to the nice parts of this game. Make of that what you will, but if you do decide to play this game, I advice muting everyone before the match even begins including your own team. It\u0027s your own team that will berate and harass you with the most racist and hateful speech you can imagine much more often than the opposing team. Score-wise I gave it a 6 because I think it represents exactly what I\u0027m trying to say this game is fantastic, but the community and players are not. Half and half. I would also like to add that I am near 200 total wins, with a winning percentage around .433. I am not new nor am I offended by the overall experience, but it is indeed a negative experience as far as the community goes. I subject myself to the player interactions because I can (usually) take it in stride, mute the player, and move on. If you don\u0027t have a thick skin though, this game is not for you.… Expand",

The game offers full experience to every hero instead of paying to play the hero you desire. Of course, Dota 2 is enjoyable at first. After having playing the game for over 600 hours; the game contains various things I dislike. For example, the Quest tab is actually a tutorial instead of what I expected to be either a mini-campaign for all the heroes or a campaign containing back-story for the characters. But when I found that out I was simply disappointed even now. Some hero dialogues are plain lazy such as Tidehunter\u0027s lame level-up dialogues of eating sea-creatures. Furthermore, if you fail to do what a team-mate desires they will insult you; some will even ask you to simply quit playing Dota 2. Now, there is a report button but it requires multiple players to do so, but most of the time no one reports the unsporting player which this really disappointed me. Moreover, when you know you\u0027re going to lose (enemies are unstoppable, your defenses are destroyed, your items are basic, your level is low, etc) there is obviously no point in staying, unless you don\u0027t want to get reported or insulted by the bad community or get battle points and item drops (usually useless cosmetics). Beside of me \u0027bashing\u0027 this game, Dota executes well for playing with your friends in a full team or in a team match which you gain full communication. I highly recommend this as I often get a team that does not communicate well. Dota 2 should include significant changes in modes and add \u0027Fast Respawn Mode\u0027 as the mod has it and because it\u0027s longass waiting time is really frustrating. Although, I have not mentioned \u0027over-powered\u0027 heroes there is always a way to \u0027counter\u0027 them. Unless they counter you. Many may disagree with my review but this is simply my opinion of Dota 2. I am actually being kind to this game with its score (otherwise this might have been a 6 or 5) because it does keep me \u0027enjoyed\u0027 for some parts of the 600 hours I\u0027ve played ever since the early beta.… Expand",

And if you learn the game the right way, even the learning process is tons of fun. But if learn it the wrong way...it can be horrible due to the community. Speaking about that...if you are looking to get into DOTA2, here are a few tips that I think should make your n00b experience less painful: 1. Don\u0027t just stick to one or two heroes...in order to be a good player, you have to learn what the other heroes can do so you can better counter them. The worst thing in DOTA is to be ignorant of an opponent\u0027s abilities and then do something silly like run around when Bloodseeker ruptures you and wonder why you died. You only get this experience from trying out each hero. 2. On that note...until you are very confident, NEVER pick a hero you haven\u0027t played before in a multiplayer game. Always try out new heroes in bot games so you can get comfortable with how they play. 3. Most importantly, realize that DOTA is honestly more like a team sport than a game. It is competitive, and if you don\u0027t take it seriously, you will ruin the experience for your team-mates. I know it\u0027s frustrating when people yell at you, and sometimes they honestly are just wrong and being jerks...but be considerate and realize that if you go in unprepared you are basically being a jerk too. I mean, would you play goalie in a competitive game of soccer without ever practicing or even knowing what the goalie is supposed to do? No...so take the same philosophy with DOTA 2...dont\u0027 play a hero or a position/role when you are completely ignorant of how it is supposed to function. Just put in the time to do a bit of research and practice and you will have a much better experience! Happy gaming!… Expand",

It\u0027s a $10 virtual book which allows you to really follow and interact with the tournament as it progresses. You\u0027ll be able to make predictions about all kinds of game stats and winners, stamp your book with collectible player cards which you can collect from playing the game, create a fantasy team and earn points based on their performance throughout the tournament, and also vote on who you want to see play in the 1v1 and all-star matches using your compendium. But possibly the best thing about the compendium is that 75% of your $10 purchase will go directly to the tournament\u0027s prizepool. What started out as a $1.6 million prize pool has almost reached $2.6 million through the community\u0027s purchasing of compendiums. And along the way, Valve has rewarded compendium purchasers for reaching 5 of the prizepool milestones by them unique skins and items which themselves are worth the $10 purchase (Any future compendium buyers even get all the previous rewards as well so they won\u0027t be missing out). Even the 1v1 tournament portion portion of the event wasn\u0027t originally planned, but is now being held as a reward for the compendium reaching its 5th milestone. By getting into Dota 2, you\u0027re not just learning to play a game, you\u0027re learning to play an e-sport. It\u0027s a game you\u0027ll have countless hours of fun playing, but also a game you can watch and follow even when you don\u0027t feel like playing. And watching Dota 2 can be just as captivating as playing it, because there can be so many amazing and exciting things that can happen.… Expand",

Korea w/ Starcraft. I really believe this. Valve has done a simply amazing job of bringing the game over into its own while retaining the character and solid mechanics of its WC3 counterpart. It\u0027s a highly challenging game that will immerse you for hours, the support of the pro scene is phenomenal, and the little holiday events that Valve puts on just ads to the charm of the game. The characters are well developed and feel unique not only in their gameplay styles, but also in their personalities. They do not feel static, but feel very alive, just like an RPG should. It\u0027s the perfect blend. If you\u0027re into games that are addicting, have high skill caps, e-sports, team play, and community, then definitely try DotA. The community CAN be a little brutal sometimes, but once you find some good, mature, and patient friends to play with, that\u0027s when this game really shines. Their matchmaking system would be my only complaint. They are still sorting it and are actively looking at ways to improve it, but it\u0027s really put a damper on the game since its launch. The temporary issues with MM aside, this game is an absolute masterpiece. What could you expect from Valve though? These guys are the new Blizzard.… Expand",

For those who know how to play, have a balanced match with other players of similar skill or even more experienced is very rewarding and fun, it feel like to play a real game of football, basketball or any other sport under the same conditions. But not everything is perfect. For beginners is one of the hardest games to learn and master. All choices are important, since the hero to your items or even your \"line\" matter. And to make the right choices you need to understand and consider what qualities, disadvantages and various other aspects when choosing... and the only way to learn is by trying, struggling, being blamed for the defeats and various other things. If you take learning with humor you\u0027ll probably have a good laughs, but if you do not have a lot of patience to learn and not have anyone to help you, I advise you to skip this game and avoid stress. The main reason why I can not give 10/10 is the process of training that should be much improved as well as some other aspects such as match-making. Finally, like any new game Dota 2 have their faults that can be corrected over time, but that surely does not affect the main purpose of the game, which is fun, challenging and competitive, something that the game achieves very effectively, hence... 9/10 for Dota 2.… Expand",

Dota 2 is considered to this day \"THE\" MOBA game and it\u0027s impossible to deny that a lot of veterans and old gamers of the old version haveI\u0027ve never been a big MOBA player and I really, REALLY suck at RTS games or any game that requires real time strategy: this point shows an opinion from an outsider, and not a veteran, as I just randomly got into this game and played for over 100 hours. Dota 2 is considered to this day \"THE\" MOBA game and it\u0027s impossible to deny that a lot of veterans and old gamers of the old version have both gripes and angers upon this game for changes and whatever: like I said, I\u0027ll just say what I think as a random gamer. And that is, this game is excellent...for a free to play game. For starters, the game already lets you use EVERY hero in the roster from the start with NO money required to buy other avatars: that is a HUGE pro because, as many know, in other f2p MOBA games (like LoL) you need to buy with real money the other heroes (or be extremely patient), or else you\u0027ll be stuck with a few bunches every week that changes sporadically. This also means that the only thing you can buy are costumes and keys for crates, which unlock other costumes or parts...just like tf2 (afterall it\u0027s also a game of Valve). But that\u0027s it actually: the game asks nothing else from us and the fact that you HAVE all the heroes at once means a HUGE longevity from the start: every hero is unique in their skillsets and have an unique design that are kinda fascinating (sure, there are exceptions, but if I had to make examples, it would take all day); the statuses and the levelling upgrades are very well programmed, since that you only need to check out for 6 stats :Attack, defense, speed and the 3 main stats, which are strength, agility and intelligence; these last stats are also how the heroes are splitted, which basically means that the items you will need are gonna be more or less effective, depending on your main attribute, which will increase BOTH your damage AND whatever the stat grants: for example strength increase hp, agility increases armor and attack speed, and intelligence gives you more mana and mana regenration. With the items splitted into 3 stats plus other statuses (and with also items that give unique abilities and many active items), you can see that, on paper, the game is very big and \"complete\" from the get go. Of course though, with a big roster of heroes, we also have a lot of issues with balancing: heroes are splitted into various roles that can do also multiple roles, and these roles also define their main focus on the match and how they must be played That it\u0027s actually well done...for the most part. Sure, some heroes WILL be more powerful than others and WILL need a lot of effort to take down, but at the same time you\u0027ll see their weaknesses from the instant you\u0027ll try to fight them, showing a balance...to a certain degree, since some heroes are extremely powerful that, while not being overpowered, they CAN be the ruination of the match. In the end, also, it\u0027s also up to the player, since every character have a weakness that must be exploited to take them down (Stealth based heroes, for instance, require a dust to take them down or you won\u0027t be able to spot them anymore). Enough of good points...what\u0027s rotten instead? There are various issues in the game like the difficulty that REALLY requires a lot of training in practice mode but, if I have to pick one in particular, it\u0027s gonna be... The community. This isn\u0027t the worst community ever...but sure is annoying! Don\u0027t take me wrong though, EVERY SINGLE ONLINE GAME has at least a part of community that can\u0027t stop annoy other people, so I can\u0027t really say it\u0027s the biggest problem of the game (or else every mmo or online game in existence would have a zero just because of the community). But yes, the community can be a problem: in many matches I\u0027ve played, there was, AT BEST, one leaver from one of the teams...if not 2 or more: that means that if a player leaves, that match is gonna be a loss or a tough fight, because there\u0027s NO substitution of players; I heard they were planning some sort of player switching and I do hope so because I\u0027ve seen so many matches lost because of one \"insert insult\" decided that not getting a first blood means we fail as a team. But I\u0027ll be honest saying that, while I\u0027ve seen MANY bad players, I\u0027ve also had many good people willing to cooperate and I rarely met too many \"insert insult\" willing to ruin the mood and the game, so I consider myself lucky to have played many good matches, without mentioning some matches won with huge disadvantage (I once won 3 against 5, but also lost 5 against 2!). Other issues are probably the items in the shop, which can be expensive too...but that\u0027s entirely for looks and nothing else, so it does\u0027t count. Probably there are other minor issues but I can\u0027t much, except that Dota 2, as a MOBA game, it\u0027s very complete and deep, with no restrictions on how to start: you can start anytime, and you can pick any hero and enjoy until you want, either improving or just for relaxing. The limit is only your patience.… Expand",

On top of that you can actually win cosmetic items for the heros just by playing the game. I will not discuss the actual gameplay in great depth Plenty of people do that already, suffice to say that it has the most complex mechanics out of any Trilane-based game. The engine works very well, looks great, and lacks the issue of \"spell clutter\" often found in a game like Leage of Legends, where so many spells are going off in huge, obnoxious colors it\u0027s hard to know what\u0027s going on In general, once you know what to spot in Dota 2, you can analyze team fights with ease. Whether its gameplay is better or worse than LoL, in my opinion, is personal preference to how difficult you want the basic game mechanics to be, and how casual of a player you are if you like competitive, hardcore gaming, Dota 2 is better suited to you. Both games are smooth, work well, look good, and offer satisfying gameplay, but for a different crowd. There is a huge caveat though that I feel the need to mention, where this game lacks behind its competitors; The community, the leaver system, the matchmaking, the lack of region locks, and the HUD, altogether, make what should be an incredible gaming experience an incredibly frustrating one. Leavers are quite rare in League of Legends. They are generally heavily penalized and most people avoid them at higher summoner levels, because of the level of time investment necessary to get a free account to such a high level, the length of bans due to leaving too often, the tribunal system, and how active the community is in using its report system and enforcing it. The community, as hard as it is to believe, is actually worse in Dota 2 than in any other MOBA I have played, In part because of all the other issues mentioned. Integrated microphones without region locks mean people from Russia will queue as teams on American servers, not speak english, and talk in russian all game, or curse at you in english and just troll all game. A limit of 2 reports a week, which can only result in a global mute for a short period of time (and quite rarely) does absolutely nothing to deter trolls and leavers. When someone leaves a game, after 5 minutes, everyone can start leaving the game without any consequence, and whoever is left over will decide whether it\u0027s a win or a loss. Meaning some dude on your team rage quits, after 5 minutes 2 other members of your team leave, and you\u0027re instant loss. The Matchmaking is absurd. I\u0027ve played matches with people who have more than 10 times the games I\u0027ve played, and people with 10 times less games than I\u0027ve played, on the same team, in the same match. (100 wins 10 wins 1000 wins, for example, same team). And the gap of game knowledge is beyond apparent, it\u0027s gross and it reinforces the negativity of the community due to frustration from the new player for playing inadequately and probably being berated by his team, anger at the experienced player for losing his time, and a negative atmosphere for absolutely everyone else in the game. One of the biggest failures in this game, is that for a game that claims to be much more suited around competitive play, it surely should have a scaling HUD, like LoL does as a casual game? Guess what, no. No it doesn\u0027t. The HUD is The size of it and pure amount of dead space blocking your screen gives you severe disadvantages when approaching situations from certain angles. Also I cannot count on 2 hands the amount of times I right clicked on the minimap while escaping from enemies (playing Radiant) and turning around and running back into their team. I\u0027ve never done this in LoL, ever. In the end, it doesn\u0027t matter if it\u0027s the best MOBA I\u0027ve ever played mechanics wise if 1 out of 2 games are incredibly unpleasant to participate in because of these issues. And while I respect Valve and Icefrog for being focused on balancing above all else, not taking active measures to make the community better, and being purely passive about accepting such negative and counter-productive behavior, will eventually kill everything but the most hardcore of fans. 5/10. Only worth playing for hardcore fans of complex, deep MOBA systems Those with little time to waste, casual players, or those with difficulty dealing with trolls/leavers/bad attitudes should look elsewhere for a more fun-oriented, lower stress MOBA.… Expand",

All negative reviews are due to new player not having the patience to understand the mechanics of this game. While League of Legends is often the one most compared to dota, the two are vastly different and drawing this parallel is futile as their target audiences are wholly different. To make something absolutely clear, every single hero is a viable option, it all depends upon the player\u0027s style, skill level, and the team composition. Many will tout that this game\u0027s lacking is in its community, yet do not strive to take the effort to find the players worth adding as friends and developing partners whom compliment your play style. You might as well say your local coffee shop has a bad community, but that doesn\u0027t accurate reflect the coffee shop as a whole does it now? To those new, give it time. It\u0027s a game that (very much like counter strike) you have to take a bit more seriously to truly enjoy. Once you hit the base level of understanding specific characters and being rewarded for such, it\u0027s a satisfaction unlike any other.

There is almost 100 characters in dota 2 giving you so many different styles/ways of playing. The characters even have their own bio, telling you who they are. There is a great amount of items to test out in different combinations and on different characters giving you many more reasons to play. The multiplayer is pretty good. Most players are nice and will help you fight. The multiplayer may disconnect you in the screen where you wait for everyone to be ready which can put you on the other team if you have friends on the team your on. There is a training mode which teaches you how to do most things in the game. There is also bot matches which puts you and 4 computer controlled players against 5 computer controlled players. This helps you prepare and learn different characters and how they are in a real match. Overall, this game is great, the only flaws are the multiplayer disconnecting and learning the game, even though there is training and bot matches, it still takes a little while to get use to it.… Expand",

Valve\u0027s intentions were to update the old game but to keep it true to the original, there is nothing wrong with this. - Yes the learning curve is very steep, for me this was my first MOBA and while it was challenging to start out in the game I have been playing it for over a year and it\u0027s highly rewarding. For me it actually took a fair bit of time watching the game and doing some research in order to progress at a quicker pace. - People say this is \"broken\" or unbalanced which couldn\u0027t be further from the truth. All of the heroes in the game have their place and can be useful and powerful in certain situations. One hero may seem to be over powered to you but that\u0027s because you aren\u0027t familiar enough with their weaknesses or a hero to proper counter any perceived \"OPness\". There isn\u0027t a single hero in DOTA 2 that is OP, all of them can be stopped if you use the right strategy. - It\u0027s highly likely you struggled with the game because generally in the newbie queue all the players want to play agility carries, you all just want to go kill stuff but that\u0027s not how the game works. There needs to be a proper balance between supports, mid game/semi carries and late game carries. Do yourselves a favour if you are starting the game new, play support heroes. You already have no clue what you are doing, it\u0027s best to have no clue while you are support those who might have an idea. This will allow you to get into the game while not playing as important a role. (not that support isn\u0027t important, at higher levels it\u0027s just as difficult to play good support as to carry if not more so). And don\u0027t be a greedy support, in most cases all you need is a magic wand, boots and in some cases maybe a blink dagger/force staff. Other than these items you should be buying wards, dust, smoke etc. all while protecting your carry and NOT stealing his farm. - For those who gave this game a 0 they obviously didn\u0027t put the time in, until you actually understand all the heroes in the game you can\u0027t comprehend the depth involved to play this game at a higher level. For those who are willing to put the time in the game is excellent and should be experienced the price is definitely right.… Expand",

Matchmaking: The algorithms used by valve are just horrible you don\u0027t know who youre gonna play with or if he/she even speaks your language(even if you select just spanish or just english). you can get to play with noobies or with pros and worse you can get a mixture of both, so in a game you\u0027re a pro and you get a guy that knows how to play 2 that have an idea and 1 that has just started playing and the other team gets 4 good players and 1 that doesn\u0027t. thats an example but its even worse than that cause usually you get noobs all the time that think they can play and they dont and the leave, making you lose the just because someone was trolling them or because they got to stressed. 2. Report System: the RS is just lame. it looks like they didn\u0027t even thought about it. it gives you3 options either to much talking, abuse of skills, and i dont remember the third xD. this gives a chance to bash the hell out of new players by \"pro\" players or people who think they are by saying report X person because he is a noob. 3. DotA Gameplay: The original dota was just as harsh as this one. i mean you don\u0027t know how to play DotA, don\u0027t come and play DotA 2 because your gonna get insulted like never before. 4. Nothing New: It has the same characteristics of DotA 1 except for grapics that are better but the animation problems are still the same,what do i mean by this? in DotA a certain kind of hero let\u0027s say i.e. a wizard would lift his arms up then point at one direction and cast a spell then stood there for 1 sec doing nothing that\u0027s the spell animation of the hero, now when you actually got to learn how to stop this animation from happening all the way, you might say that you know basics. in DotA 2 you have this same problem but as i have tried there\u0027s no stopping some animations, you just have to wait for the 2 sec animation and get pounded while your at it. 5. Shop: I don\u0027t know why they changed the shop style, if they didn\u0027t change anything else why the shop? DotA players knew what letters to what items to buy, now they\u0027re numbers. it completely obliges you to learn all the new numbers and it\u0027s just lazy. 6. The Pro Gameplay: DotA stays the same for pros once you get used to the new commands and the shop. 7: Team matchs: Another Matchmaking error, once you get a few players that you qualify as \"good\" and add them as friends, you can get a team and search with them for matches. This is great if you\u0027re on the team. Horrible if you\u0027re not. you might be a pro but get to play with 5 people that know DotA and you get 4 of them that don\u0027t, Result: POUNDED. 8. Bugs: There are some known bugs out there that you might not know like being in the shadows or a certain kind of spot that even if you\u0027re right beside the hero you won\u0027t see them, again if you don\u0027t know how to play you\u0027re screwed. 9. Basics: The tutorial gives you a veeeeeeery small minded picture of what the game really is, it actually gives you one or two good pointers like, last hitting, and buying potions but that\u0027s about it. thats not DotA. 10. Microphone: the mic feature is great...if you the language of the people that are speaking it, if not it\u0027s just annoying, and worse there are some people whose mics sound ALL THE TIME, like you hear them breathing and stuff like that, just annoying. 11. Community: Again, if you want to play DotA 2, Learn how to play DotA or practice till you can beat the out of Unfair bots, then youre ready to play with people and get ready to be insulted, mistreated, trolled, reported unfairly, screamed at, etc. the community SUCKS. and i mean it. im a pro player and i understand the anger of other players when they get noob players, but i actually surpassed that, now i know that a noob player can be taught, a player that \"thinks\" he is good, doesn\u0027t want to be taught and actually will insult you if you try to give pointers,so in my experience, youre a newbie, say it from the beginning so someone that know how to play helps you but then again, try to beat unfair bots then play with people. 12. Given all of these critics the matchmaking, the report system, the anti-newbie community, the gameplay,etc. i think DotA 2 is a great game for people that know how to play it. but a NIGHTMARE for people that dont.… Expand",

It is still designed with the \"custom game\" mentality of the original: it is not one that seems to even WANT to have a large player base. That said, it is an improved version of the original and fun when things go your way if you stick around long enough. Let me elaborate on my statement that it is not designed to be successful: the learning curve is steep, and painful, even for those who are very familiar with the genre. Until you are at a high competitive level, once you are down you stay down. There are many champions that are very strong against new players that are not very good at all at higher levels of play very anti-fun mechanics leave you muttering and wishing to give up, which is not an option until your opponents choose to end the game, no matter how far behind you are. The lack of protection for new players does allow for more fun and wild champion design, but may not be worth the price. The community remains nearly as toxic as the original, and when you can choose to play a champion that is permanently invisible or can dash across the map and stun you for the entire time it takes to kill you, this isn\u0027t surprising.… Expand",

Diretide in 2012 provided this, i made a lot of friends that im still playing with at this event. A week ago i got hyped for the awesome halloween event Valve would have made for Dota2. The TF2 events always were fun, and i couldnt wait to return to Diretide. But nothing happened. No communication, no diretide. I and many others got angry and demanded atleast some communication towards the biggest playerbase on Steam. Just a little more then an hour ago they updated Dota2, with only cosmetics. Just a few cosmetics, while the playerbase is raging about the fact that there is no Diretide event. And jet no communication has been made. Valve, you have dissapointed me. In my eyes you were the best in communicating and making games software. But after this, i have lost all hope in Valve.

The players are: Egotistic, ego centric, unsporting, aggressive, hostile, uncaring, mean, mistrusting, immature, callous, apathetic and incredibly pretentious while at every loss prompting everyone inside the current game to \"Report player X\" if someone on their team was even remotely new to the game or did any other action not sanctified by them, be it going in what lane you want, not purchasing courier/wards or simply just had an unlucky run/getting cross-classed. Along with being completely miserable to be around, they frequently never speak the language in the region you\u0027re playing and nowhere else is this more apparent when russian is spammed into the chat at all times on European zones from 3 different sources at once. And if people do know English, trolling is nothing short but assured from all directions to all teams. Second biggest problem with this game would be the elitist mindset that orbits anyone that has played this atrocious game for more than a couple of hours. Any behavior that breaks the typical dota 2\u0027s hardcore player routine of buying tango, healing salve and iron branches, perhaps with some boots of speed if they\u0027re feeling adventurous will result in a wave of F-bombs, intentional feeding, votes of surrender, spam prompts to report player X and disconnecting users as far as the eye can see. I even had cases where players left the game because some guy forgot to buy a courier at the start of the game. And that\u0027s me overlooking the fact that killstealing off your TEAMMATES is considered average behavior/a common tactic. In LoL, you can even report people for \"being unskilled\". As in, anyone. Even if they\u0027re level 1.To put it bluntly, MOBA\u0027s like dota 2 give out a special kind of disgusting behavior that makes me feel physically ill for very good reasons. Coming close to problem number 2 is the third epic fail problem of this game. The match-making in Dota 2. Broken, poorly thought through and executed horribly. You are prompted to select a variety of regions before initiating the match-making system and the more regions you have selected, the less waiting time.. Which begs the question, what is the point with the regional system if you\u0027re just gonna encourage people to sign up for all regions? The end result will be that nobody sticking to their geographical zones and not only causes frustration in the form of people trying to communicate and chat with eachother in the chat as described above but also disallows any kind of vocal text tactical communication since everyone does not speak the same language. In all honestly, this game is overloaded with issues just like this and I would be able to overlook this particular embarassing design-flop if it wasn\u0027t for the actual hard functionality of the MM as well being broken. The scenario on where 4-5 organized people in a group, all sitting in ventrilo/teamspeak while packing thousands of hours in Dota 2 each have a very likely possibility to be \"teamed\" up against new players with less than 10 hours with no complaints from the match-making system (even if there is a very large queue) throws out any chance of that. This happens particulary often if you decide to try the game out with a friend or two which leaves me with yet another question: The purpose of match-making was to find equally skilled opponents. So why is this even remotely possible? Team-based games with a mandatory MM are supposed to be fair. Not Tyrannosaurus rex VS a duckling. I\u0027m reluctant to say that Dota 2 even has a match-making at all once you look at all the facts. Even with all these problems, I could actually see myself overlooking them at a certain time during a year due to the sheer amount of possible combinations in this game with heroes \u0026 items and the addictive quality the game has if it wasn\u0027t for all the other flaws. The commitment to play DotA MOBA\u0027s however, is the biggest flaw of them all that this game inhibits. It changes whoever plays the game as a person. For the worse. Why? Because the game inhibits \"addictive\" qualities similar with that of jamming needles full with endorphin into your spine every half hour. It\u0027s painful, it hurts your emotional stability, it hurts you as a person and it hurts the people around you and for what? A small kick of pleasure/self satisfaction as you managed to win a fundamentally unbalanced game with an emphasis on gank above all else due to chance or otherwise pre-meditated \"pubstomping\"? Not worth it in so many ways since at the end of the day, Dota 2 will never be fully balanced because Valve will be split between tournament-balances and casual or the \"normal\" version of the game while repeatedly adding more and more content in the form of heroes. I could keep on going with design flop after design flop but at the end of the day, this game is not worth anyone\u0027s time or dedication.… Expand",

Yes, Valves lack of communication is an issue, but spamming metacritic is not the right way to go about telling them that. It damages the game in the long term, and will accomplish nothing.

AlmostGood things: -The graphics are gorgeous. -Animations are almost perfect and natural like they\u0027re supposed to be. -The core mechanics are extremely well-made. -It\u0027s quite fun at times. Bad things: -The matchmaking is a horror. Before you queue up for a game you get to choose the region you want to play in and the language preference, but the game doesn\u0027t really respect that. Almost everyone that played this game already knows this, russians are everywhere, no matter where you play, it can be US, it can be Europe or Asia, russians are everywhere. Now I\u0027ve had some bad experience with these type of players even though I do not wish to generalize but when even the language preference gets ignored when you queue up for a game and you get a game full of russians where only 2 of them speak english. In my experience, russians are the worst players to have in your team. I am not generalizing here, I know there are exceptions, there are always exceptions but almost everytime I had a russian in my team he didn\u0027t even speak english or he didn\u0027t even try to communicate with his own team besides cursing and I only wish that I won\u0027t deal with these kind of players in my future games but it\u0027s inevitable since Russia is the prime demographic for dota2 by population. -The community is toxic, no matter what you, no matter how you do it, the community will always be toxic. It\u0027s a competitive game, it\u0027s completely normal, but man, I\u0027ve encountered some type of players that are the worst human beings in this world. Now I\u0027m speaking about cursing your own teammates or stuff like that, when you try and help someone, or teach them a lesson that apparently they don\u0027t know, their ego inflates so much that he will no longer be a part of your team. Most of them will either leave, feed intentionally by walking right into the enemy and staying there until they kill him or just doing things that generally helps the enemy team more than it helps you (a.k.a. sending the courier into the enemy lines so it will die therefore we cannot transport items and the enemy team earns a bounty for killing our courier, OR even using special items like the force staff to push you into the enemy etc, the list is way too long). Meanwhile there ARE indeed consequences, leaving puts you into low priority for X ammount of time based on your total abandons or abandon spree and reporting players but that doesn\u0027t seem to be enough. -The reporting system is a spam and that\u0027s it. If someone does not like you, they\u0027ll report you for whatever reason. I don\u0027t know how the reporting system works but sometimes I get into low priority for nothing, literally nothing or nothing that I know about. Do people actually check the replay for every report submission sent? Because that would be way too hard for the devs to do considering it\u0027s players number and the devs number and/or admins. -The matchmaking is a forced 50%. This means that if you win 9 games in a row, you will lose 9 games in a row and not in the same way. For example today you win 4 times and lose 5 times, tomorrow you\u0027ll lose 3 more times and so on until your win/lose ratio ends up to a roughly 50%. This thing means nothing whatsoever. People who are playing competitive games usually have hopes or are actively practicing games so they could step in the pro scene. Now the way other games in this genre are doing is by adding a ranking system bronze, silver, diamond, cheese, bacon whatever etc that a player can be proud of and show to the team he wishes to enter or to know his current status as a player compared to others. What does the 50% win ratio prove? Absolutely nothing, you\u0027re the same as the other players, it doesn\u0027t matter that you stack with other players and you\u0027re on skype or whatever, you\u0027ll eventually end up with players better than you that will kick you back down and down from the very beggining. The matchmaking should add players of your current skill level so the match would be even. Most games I get are usually one sided stomps that don\u0027t even get to see the 30 minutes mark of the game, which is considered a very important part of the game since there are actually heroes that are good only after that 30 minute mark, also known as hard-carries. -This game used to have weekly updates with old heroes that needed to be ported into the game, cosmetics so the developers can actually earn money and general gameplay updates and bugfixes. They also used to make events during the obvious holidays of the year, well, most of the time. A year ago DotA2 had an event called Diretide during the Halloween that had a new gamemode added to the game that was Halloween inspired, The Greeviling for the christmas and so on and so forth, but this year, it seems like that has changed. DotA 2 didn\u0027t get any Halloween inspired event at all and in the past 3 months, the game had a single patch besides cosmetics patch. I am no longer buying cosmetics from the store until they decide to work on the game.… Expand",

Its great and yeah,MOSTLY valve did a great job in the past. But they screwed it over this time. Reading all of these give Diretide posts? It might be a bit irritating for \"outsiders\" but in fact a very viable,alive game with one of the strongest gaming communities ever was bought by valve. In the begining they communicated and had visible progress,I think I can say everyone in the community was glad they did their job that well. But after releasing the game,making it the biggest game on steam and such... there was nothing. There still is nothing. Silence,no updates. Heroes were added in like weekly back in the beta days,there are still A LOT of heroes missing from old DotA 1 and well... no overall progress for months. But it was okay,the people believed in something cool for Diretide (the Halloween event held last year),it was like everyone was saying: \"It\u0027s okay you don\u0027t have the heroes just give us something new to play\". NOTHING. Not even a \"sorry we cant do it this year\" nor bug fixes (this is another pretty big problem,there are about 1000 KNOWN BUGS not being fixed... well,since beta. So everyone was waiting for this update,because hey we didn\u0027t get anything else in the near past. Instead of releasing the halloween update they release cosmetic items (slang: hats) to buy. You know there are people refreshing a community driven page every 30seconds to know if there is a really needed update to a game that just went out of beta. There is none. Even sader there is no communication,there is no feel of improvement. There is just more stuff to spend your hard earned money on. And this is why all the people are mad and why this is absolutely legitimate. BECAUSE IT IS OUR (THE CUSTOMERS (its f2p,but the majority of this community spent money in good will)) way to show our disagreement IN HOPE TO CHANGE VALVES BEHAVIOUR IN THE FUTURE. Again this is not about DotA in general,this is about the games treatment by valve. they are literally killing their own child. I hope this is strong enough to beware em… Expand",

Noone is checking those reports. YOu can be reported for being black or for wearing glasses and believe me: YOU WILL. Valve doesnt talk with its playerbase at all, the UI sucks big time as well as the game interface nothing gets changed, you buy tournament tickets ingame: they lack casters, the casters audio lags so hard its unwatchable, very bad matchmaking that couples a very bad player with a very good player so we have a balanced team, right? RIGHT???? No ladder, no MMR, no feeling of progression. Artwork is getting up though by the weekly (very often more than once a week) Hat patches valve is making money from. I will never buy another steam game nor put any kind of dollar into this platform after Rome 2 and DotA 2. Thank you fat lord Gaben.

Over the progression of the game, prices continuously increase and the community fanbase continuously worsens. There is no way of setting a public, free room and instead you are thrown into one of their preset matchmaking queues. The way around this is through third party match clients such as the IXDL. Even though it is so popular Valve frantically prances around in its ignorance of implementing such a crucial system. The gameplay is average in the current battleground of MOBA games while the graphics are generally better. Overall I am just playing this game to make some money. Nothing more.

This is embarrassing considering it has been 3 months since the last hero was added. - Dysfunctional punishment system. No in-game moderators or tribunals that can assist in rooting out the \u0027rotten apples\u0027 of the community. - Because of the nature of the Matchmaking System, you can forget about Solo-queuing and having a good time. Unless you play with friends, at certain levels, you will only have a terrible gaming experience, including lots of flaming and blaming. Once again I say this as someone who has been playing the game for 7 years. Unfortunately, these negatives drag the game so far downwards that I do not even enjoy playing it anymore. However if Valve can fix these issues, this game will become unrivaled. Good luck to Valve, because thus far I am extremely disappointed.… Expand",

Stop making hats and make some content or you will die of thirst to better teams, i have a free keys to open the chests of your minds: good games MAKE MONEY, good teams developing good games MAKES MORE MONEY, listening to your community to improve your game with a good team MAKES EVEN MORE MONEY.

If you have a few friends looking for a team game to play this is a great one without a doubt. Be warnedDota 2 is a fantastic MOBA that is based off of the original Dota 1 from the WC3 era. The game is immensely complex in all of its mechanics but very simple to understand. As you can guess this results in a massive learning curve and adheres to \"easy to understand, difficult to master\". If you have a few friends looking for a team game to play this is a great one without a doubt. Be warned that you will get frustrated at times with your team mates, and if you solo que you risk being put on teams with those who may not speak the same language. Queing on US East servers does NOT guarantee and english speaking team, but honestly, that is the biggest issue. Otherwise, the game is flawless in execution. All heroes are immediately available, there is a tutorial mode for new players, and the ability to create your own private matches if you have a large group of friends to play your own games. These matches can also be changed to include \u0027cheats\u0027 and have zero cool down on abilities which makes for some hilarious games with your friends. Generally, Dota 2 is hugely addictive, and is a ton of fun! Particularly when you get into the high skill heroes and when you learn the \u0027juke spots\u0027. There is a ton of material on youtube to help you learn and to up your game. I personally have logged well over a 1000 hours as have many of my friends. Don\u0027t be fooled though, this may share similarities to HoN or LoL but it is NOT the same.… Expand",

But in light of the intentional score sabotage campaign by legions of petulant children, I figure I should do my part to bring it back up to where it belongs. Let\u0027s get one thing out of the way from the start: the game is difficult. Mechanically, there are more challenging games. But you\u0027ll be hard pressed to find a game that taxes situational awareness and decision making more than DOTA. Even after almost 700 hours with the game, I still make many blunders in judgement per game. Watching the streams of notable community members who have dumped thousands of hours into this game and its predecessor and you\u0027ll see the same thing. They say that there are no two chess games alike and that there are more possible chess moves than there are atoms in the universe. Dota is even more complex. So is there hope for the new player? In short, yes. There are many many quality resources out there for the education of players, both new and old. There are in game templates to guide you through which items to choose. There are many useful youtube channels offering tutorials and other guides for making the correct choices. And with the streaming technology of today, you can watch popular pro players play their games every day or watch tournament matches to learn the tactics of the best players in the world. The staggering thing about this game is the depth and nuance. The primary name behind the game, Icefrog, has been the caretaker of this game and its predecessor for years. You can tell whenever changes are made that there is a deep understanding behind them, there is a man who has devoted so much time to the game that he understands each interaction and what needs to be done to bring things back into balance. Every change is measured, purposeful, and many of them are outrageously clever. This is a game that rewards both careful thought and study and mechanical practice. As they continue to flesh out the features, I\u0027m sure it will be easier to track and measure your progress, but as it is, it\u0027s very rewarding to learn new things and apply them to your play. This is truly a brilliant game.… Expand",

This game is much harder than League of Legends in the respect that there are mechanics in DotA 2 that is not present in LoL. Mechanics such as denying, day and night vision difference, creep blocking, the concept of a courier system, or things such as being punished for dying via losing gold (aka reliable and unreliable gold). As you start playing DotA 2 and accepting such mechanics exist in the game, it becomes more fluid and you start to develop game sense such as mini-map awareness, your reliable gold vs unreliable gold, the time (aka if it is night or day). These are small things that you might not become aware at first, but it\u0027s one of the things you will see yourself improving very significantly. Combined with the fact that every game is different, and there is a counter to every hero, it is a rewarding game that allows you to explore more of yourself as a gamer.… Expand",

And guess wut the everybody on the enemy side have OVER 600+ wins while im stuck with idiots who picks only carries and pudge. and it seems that if im playing alone in pubs people cant seem to talk english becos its too hard. other than the matchmaking system being this game offers a lot of fun if u play wif friends.

They\u0027re both massively different games, but DOTA features several additional layers of complexity such as denying, jungle stacking, couriers, and buybacks. They give the game a completely different flow and provide several different items to strategize on. The gameplay is great, lots of different heroes with their own niches, and tons of items that each have something that sets them apart. The graphics are wonderful, with rich colors and detailed models across the map. And the sound is also pretty good, they have a system that plays different music based on your context. For example if you are in combat, it will play intense music etc. The reason I\u0027m giving it 8 stars is because it\u0027s hard to see your progression. There is no ranking system for those who matchmake solo. Because of this, it\u0027s hard to see if you are improving, and how much if you are. There are crude divisions, \"normal\", \"high\", and \"very high\", but they are hard to find and the statistics for the divisions are also not disclosed. I have no idea what\u0027s up with the current rating though, this game certainly deserves more than 4 stars.… Expand",

While the learning curve may seem impossible, if you tick with it. it\u0027s bar-none the best team-game currently available. Valves attention to detail shines more so than ever before. From the unique interesting designs, to interactions based on lore between the heros, from great support to an absolutely true free-to-play game model. For people familiar with the genre The game is exceptionally balanced. Seemingly every hero is Overpowered and not a single one feels useless. There are only very -very- few abilities that actually overlap, with pretty much all abilities spread between the 100+ all feeling unique and interest. From it\u0027s gameplay, to it\u0027s sound design, heck even to it\u0027s visual design (if the quality of added cosmetics doesn\u0027t degrade) the game impresses on all fronts.

I wouldn\u0027t recommend it if you\u0027re a casual gamer and can\u0027t be bothered to invest that time. If that\u0027s the case and you want to play a MOBA then that\u0027s where LoL comes in. If you already play LoL and want something more challenging and more rewarding then by all means try Dota 2. Plus it has way better graphics, great character customization and doesn\u0027t require any money to unlock heroes (which I find very frustrating in LoL). It is also more balanced imo. As for the community, well it\u0027s still a MOBA so don\u0027t expect too much, although it\u0027s not so bad.… Expand",

First off, here\u0027s DotA 2, in a nutshell, compared to the major (also \"free\") competition (skip past this if you want). In DotA 1, you can barely see what\u0027s going on; in DotA 2, you can see things. DotA 1 is based off WC3, which is not free, and gets updates ported back; DotA 2 is standalone, and gets updates first, although it is still missing some heroes as of writing. In LoL, you have to unlock or pay for heroes, gameplay-affecting masteries, and have to pay for cosmetics, but some baseline level of Asian-style T\u0026A is free. In DotA 2, all heroes are free, and there is no equivalent to masteries, so the only thing you can spend money on is expensive cosmetics, which do not significantly effect the lower level of baseline T\u0026A. In LoL, meta is very rigid, games snowball easily, and the game is more forgiving to mistakes; in DotA 2, meta is flexible, comebacks are extremely common, and mistakes are punished hard. In HoN, everyone is angry at you and leaves your game; in DotA 2, only select ethnic groups (decided based on a player\u0027s mood at time of abandon) are angry at you, and players generally leave the game slightly less. In a nutshell, DotA 1 and HoN are for players that have played for 10 years and put up with the problems. LoL is casual, which makes it trivial to learn and better for playing games with friends. So DotA 2 is basically king right now, if not in player count. So what makes a DotA 2? It\u0027s a MOBA/ARTS/DotA-like game, which means it pits two teams of five heroes against each other, each occupying half of the square map, with territory on opposite corners, divided by the diagonal. Each side has an \"ancient\" which can be reached through three lanes. The lanes are protected by two barracks (which spawn friendly \"creeps\" periodically), and 3 towers. The goal of the game is to eventually push with the creeps down the enemy lanes to reach and destroy their ancient. Heroes gain gold and experience by killing enemy and neutral units, which they spend on items and skills that last until the end of the round. So a game goes through the arc of an RPG in about an hour: you normally first spend time hitting low-level creeps with basic attacks, then you take on higher level creeps and enemy heroes with basic abilities and items, and in the endgame (if you could afford the items and skills) you go all out with a nearly full loadout of skills and items. But this arc of battle is made interesting by how the mechanics interact. Interestingly, there are 5 heroes per side, but 3 lanes, meaning that there are several different ways to split heroes between lanes, so you\u0027ll often see interesting splits, like trilanes. You can often win the game by going with an esoteric item build (as long as you know what you\u0027re doing) and communicating with your team. Thanks to intense fog of war, wards and team communication are fundamental for map control. Positioning and timing are very important during teamfights. And things like last hits/denies introduce skill to even basic farming. You get the idea there are lots of mechanics to keep track of, teamwork is important, and there are ways to learn all of them. DotA 2 is a great game to play with a team of four other friends, and a game with a very high skill ceiling. Thanks to all the different ways the mechanics can fall together, it\u0027s a very enjoyable game to watch, too. It\u0027s pretty much at the pinnacle of its genre.… Expand",

And unlike, LoL or HoN which require you to use a rotating hero list until you buy your own with real money or accumulate enough in-game currency to purchase a single hero, DOTA 2 immediately gives you access to its entire library of heroes, for free. In LoL as of the date of this post, it would cost $588 to unlock all heroes with real money. (15000RP/$100, total cost heroes 88185 RP. This calculation excludes bundles) Each character has a unique playstyle and skillset, and doesn\u0027t feel like a clone of another character or a cheap rip off. Every character plays a certain role well, and plays it uniquely. Playing well leads to great rewards, and playing poorly has severe consequences. There are issues with DOTA 2, the biggest being there is a huge learning curve and you are going to start out being bad if you don\u0027t have previous DOTA experience. Learning characters skills, what items do, and what you should be doing early mid and late game initially may be overwhelming. However, doing research and practicing eventually pay off as DOTA 2 is truly one of the most challenging and highest skill cap games available. Valve is also implementing (or has implemented) a tutorial, but there is no way the sheer amount of information needed is contained within it. But I\u0027m sure its a great place to start.… Expand",

It has improved upon the WarCraft 3 ARTS custom map in ways that makes the game more visually appealing and it helps get new players up to speed quickly. I am not going to say that this game is better or worse than any of its competitors, only that it offers something else. Case in point: League of Legends offers a free-to-play platform where abilities are mostly comprised of \"skill shots\", contains a leveling system where the higher level you are, the more points into a tech tree you can spend and the more power-ups you can put on your character (which affect how your characters play in-game). In addition, League of Legends offers you a point system where points are earned by playing games and those points can be used to buy power-ups and unlock more heroes. Defense of the Ancients 2 is also a free-to-play game. However, there is nothing outside of actual game play that changes your character\u0027s abilities and the full roster of released heroes is readily available to you at the beginning of your DotA 2 adventure. If you have never picked up DotA or any ARTS games and you are using this to see if you are interested, please listen to me when I say it would be a good idea to fully finish the tutorial and play multiple practice games against bots. It will still match you up with 4 other people to take on AI controlled heroes, so you can still try to learn how to coordinate with other players online without the humiliation of playing against seasoned veterans. I strongly suggest starting on the easiest setting and take in where you can go, what some of the abilities do, and what limits can you push without getting yourself killed. Once you have progressed and crushed the hardest of bots underneath your trained foot do I recommend that you start really doing public match making.… Expand",

Unlike other f2p games, Dota 2 is completely dedicated to making sure that nothing that is available for purchase in the game gives any sort of advantage-- all you\u0027ll find in the Dota 2 store are extra costumes and pets that are just pretty reskins of existing models. There is nothing separating your account from any of the professional players and will never have to be concerned about being beaten by a player merely because they have played the game longer than you and have more customization options. Now, all of that is fine and dandy-- but utterly meaningless if the game is bad. Good thing that isn\u0027t a concern either-- the gameplay in Dota is on a much larger scale than any other game within the genre. The magnitude of the plays that you can make are massive, and each character is radically different from another rather than being a slight variation within the same role with a slightly different line-shaped nuke, gap-closer, and steroid. Extra abilities are purchased as items, which often have active effects that can give you an edge over your enemies or make your combos flow faster and harder. Finally, the game is developed by VALVe and has quickly overshadowed their other games, Team Fortress 2 and Counter Strike in terms of playerbase and is steadily climbing. Dota 2 will continue to grow, but even now there\u0027s no concern for a dead playerbase or long matchmaking queues. Balance of the game is undertaken by the enigmatic Icefrog, an anonymous developer with complete creative control of the game who has been controlling the game\u0027s direction for the past decade. He is the man who has grown Dota 2 from a small minigame diversion to a trailblazer for the genre and has inspired a steady amount of games to rise in his wake. It is not clear if he will ever be unmasked, but numerous theories float around the internet!… Expand",

Because Dota relies more upon the ability of the team than the skill of the individual, you will find yourself becoming frustrated with players who perform poorly. In addition to the poor community, the game has a very high learning curve. The learning curve, however, is a good thing, as it allows for Dota to have a great deal of depth. The best way to approach this, if you are a new player, is to accept that you suck, and simply persist. You will not experience the joy of Dota until you can play it competently. It will likely take you a few months to get a basic sense for the games various heroes and mechanics, but it is the journey that is important, not the destination.

The Positives: Endless of hours of gameplay Endless combinations of heroes Special game modes for holidays Easy to set up games with friends, to play with each other or against other teams Beautifully crafted Awesome contributions of items from the community The Negatives: The community. Some people are just real a-holes. The matchmaking feels incredibly broken at times. You either demolish the other team or you get demolished. It is rare to get opponents with equal skill level. Language barriers: This mostly concerns russians that don\u0027t speak a word of english and they don\u0027t care what you say if they happen to speak english. I\u0027ve learned more russian profantiy from this game than I care to admit. You can almost count the heroes with \"skill shots\" (e.g. sacred arrow, hook etc.) on one hand. Smurfing. Players that already have hundreds of hours played create new accounts to be matched against newbies. This will ruin games for beginners. A ladder is sorely missed for many players. This would enable better match making and for teams that don\u0027t play on a professional level some time in the spotlight too. Sometimes too much focus on items and customizability than on gameplay and updates of core mechanics. As you can see, the majority of the problems that this game suffers from are the community. Valve has taken some steps to solve this (e.g. choosing preferred language in games, choosing lane from character selection), but it rarely gets to the core of it, namely, player stupidity. That being said, this game is best played with five friends against other players, or just playing in house games with a larger group of friends. If you play this solo and never played DotA before, get ready to be flamed and discouraged to learn the game. The new coaching feature is for you.… Expand",

All this aside, the games do get competitive, but in my opinion, this is the only real thing going for it, the constant thriving to beat the opponent. If you do not connect with the community in some way, then it\u0027s not a particularly enjoyable affair. It\u0027s free though, so it\u0027s definitely at least worth a look, perhaps you\u0027ll love it, or perhaps you\u0027ll hate it...

Pros: Just about everything that makes this game what it is, from deep gameplay, to all classes for free, to user generated content, competitive spectating, large roster, tight controls, and great User Interface. cons: Matchmaking takes a long time and is poorly designed, community can be harsh if you don\u0027t know how to play, game is hard if you\u0027re never played a MOBA before.… Expand",

It is truly the new standard in how a f2p model should work. Not only are items available, they are made by the community itself, giving modders and creative people an opportunity to make money and do what they love. Dota 2 is a complex game. It is not easy. It has a steep learning curve and it will kick your ass. However, it is the most satisfying experience in multiplayer gaming since the quake arena days. Winning a match two barracks down is the best feeling in the world. Not only this, but you will identify yourself with the heroes. Players will not call you by your username or name, but by your hero name, putting you in the role of that hero. Dota 2 is by far the best MOBA game ever made hands down.

This game is a huge headache Ive been playing MOBA\u0027s for over 12 years. You want to progress without a team. Prepare to be at the fate of people that do not want to play as a team game. This game is meant to be a team game. The Team idea of this game is for your entire team to pick a ( Carry ) most cases a hero that can last the length of a game and skills scale very well. Hence everyone wanting to play this type of hero. Then you have support which I really do not mind playing as well as long as we are a team. Nope be prepared to be faustrated to the point of no return. I have uninstalled this game as I can truly see no positive coming from this game. People are rude. The team play is near non existent unless you are on a team and everyone wants to have the score despite no record keeping being held on the game. Yes it is easier to potty train your children then to progress past a point in this game. Then if you make mistakes instead of being coached you get bashed on continuesly until your spirit is not even in the game no more. Yes Potty training is not fun, but at least your kids arent bashing you continuesly while your coaching them to aim their skills correctly. Soapbox out and I\u0027ve uninstalled this trainwreck for the last time. Thank you valve for bringing premium entertainment at no cost but I think I would rather be in the bathroom at this point at least everyone there speaks english.… Expand",

For a free game, this offers thousands of hours of entertainment as you encounter players from all around the globe. Team up with your friends for your best chances of winning and minimising rage-inducing moments. It is unfortunate that there are many players out there who will go out of their way to make it hell for one to play. Steel yourself for the insults and cat calls and all the \u0027your mum\u0027 jokes because it will all come back with the fields of twelve year olds roaming on the servers. However, if you\u0027re lucky to encounter courteous players, you\u0027re in for a treat. There are ban systems in place to educate those to overstep the boundaries. Remember guys, it is just a game, no need to get too mad over a few deaths and lost kills. Game mechanics are mostly sound, a few minor bugs and tweaks, updates are constant, albeit at times small, they do make a difference to the game play. If you do find some bugs, it is mostly hilarious than become a game breaking moment. There are heroes to suit every play style and several modes for your choice of play: ALL PICK for a somewhat uneven play field. For your best shot, perhaps the least played hero mode. For those who are just looking for a good time with laughs; the Random Ability Draft mode is sure to tickle your fancy with a vast variety of skills being up for grabs for the random hero you are allocated. Enjoy! A great game all in all. Great for quick games (usually 40 minutes long) if you\u0027re not in the mood for something too long. Regular and attentive updates and a good 90+ heroes for you to master.… Expand",

If you are a noob player you will hear unpleasant comment about your parents and your relatives...

It\u0027s satisfying to perform tactics that you and your teammates plan, providing an exciting challenge against your enemies. While the design can be irritating at times, and while the user interface in-match could be less distracting, Dota 2, in the most time, flawlessly and beautifully. The heroes are divided by two optional choices for their hero: to make him an attacker or supporter. It depends on the overall strength and power value that the hero has. It\u0027s a must to strategize with the two elements combined, because it makes for a good teamwork and a valuable time. Killing other players is important, but slashing some creeper blood isn\u0027t bad either, helping the player to earn coins for buying important items and to earn experience, which levels you up to upgrade your powers. The powers are specialized attacks or other abilities which need to be used cleverly to positively perform the duty. They either do damage, heal, teletransport, make clones... you get it, there is a LOT of abilities counting all the heroes. And the items too need to be bought and used smartly, where the player needs to focus more on suggested items. If the suggested items are not workable right, then the dictionary helps you with everything, starting from instructions by users, to actually and visually showing what items and powers to focus on. It\u0027s really helpful. Also, crafting needs to be mentioned, for, basically, buying the expensive items that you want easier and safer. The objective of every match is to destroy enemies\u0027 defenses and to finally destroy the Ancient tower of the enemy. When you with your teammates do that, your team wins. But it gets more complicated than that, because on the other hand enemies are trying to do the same thing. If they teamwork and use powers well, they\u0027re more likely to win. But, to prevent that from happening, obviously you with your teammates need to do better than that. Playing individually is not recommended, because it shows selfishness to the player and the team might loose. So, the most important obligation is teamwork in this game. The game itself has some modes which don\u0027t change the gameplay style, but only the hero selection style. And that is really nice, because it adds multiverse to the game. I don\u0027t know if you understood the last sentence, but you\u0027ll get it if you dig deeper. Does the tutorial help? Yes, it kind of does, but you need to get an experienced player to instruct you how to play the game. And playing with bots when you start playing is recommendable. Is this game good? Dota 2 is a fantastic MOBA. Well, what did you expect from Valve? 8/10… Expand",

This means that there are more than 448 skills which you need to memorize the function of just so you won\u0027t be at a disadvantage when facing off against someone using them. Then you have to get a grasp of the highly complex mechanics, and various strategies that take a long time to learn. There are also over 100 items in the store, the purchasing of which varies from one hero and situation to the next. Again, Dota 2 is simply too complicated for its own good.

Jesus **** Christ, if you haven\u0027t played any MOBA before this is THE LAST MOBA you wanna try, it is not newbie friendly, neither is the community, there are few english speaking people who you\u0027ll find in this game and the rest are ALL **** RUSSIAN, if you wanna experience a good MOBA you should play smite or LoL (i know, i know... but they\u0027re basically DOTA 2 with smoother graphics and more competitive). Long story short, DO NOT, i repeat, DO NOT BY ANY **** MEANS PLAY THIS HORRID **** GAME.… Expand",

If you shy away from pvp, if you do not like communicating and working with other people you have never met before then you will likely not enjoy your experience with Dota 2 or any game within the larger MOBA genre. However, if you enjoy a game that provides actual challenges, does not grow stale, and that has absolutely no beginning and no end you may just enjoy this. The learning curve for new players is extremely steep. You are dropped into a completely alien system of last hitting, denying, warding, ganking, feeding, and many other words you will eventually learn how to use properly. It is perhaps the most situational game ever as there is never just one proper way to do things and frequently many wrong ways. Things that you believe should work will not and things that seem absolutely crazy and wrong will yield incredibly favorable results and eventually you will learn why. The addition of a tutorial allows completely new players to ease themselves in a bit before jumping into a game with 9 other strangers yelling at them about how badly they suck. And now to the good part, I love this game. It has provided me with hundreds of hours of pain and pleasure. There are times where you will want to quit and times you believe you never will. The word balance seems like a distant dream in a game with over 100 heroes but Valve does a very good job of keeping the game balanced at the highest level of competitive play. The in game client allows you to watch professional tournaments as they are happening along with the commentary provided by the various casters. The game is always providing new experiences, especially after each major patch when Valve completely changes how the most favored heroes work by sometimes not touching them at all. Gameplay and Mechanics are different than any other genre with the exception of the close cousin RTS games as MOBAs originated from the original Starcraft and Warcraft 3. Getting a handle on all necessary tasks for any given role (Carry, Support, etc) in a given situation takes time. You will not master the game in 5 games played and start wrecking everyone. You will always have something new to learn, that is just the nature of this sort of game. Once you learn where you are supposed to be and why you are supposed to be there your life will get much easier and your grasp of the controls will follow. Story doesn\u0027t really exist. There are short backgrounds for the heroes and some of them even feature other heroes but there isn\u0027t a reason you should want to kill the enemy\u0027s giant tree other than competition. And in a game like this that is a good thing, rather than worry about ruining the lore of the game by making some change that will get them in trouble with the community Valve just has to worry about how to balance things with each patch as well as what new features will be beneficial. Music is actually very well done, when the music picks up you will find yourself feeling like you are fighting in an epic battle for the virtual world. Occasionally the sounds or announcer will drown out parts of the music or vice versa but overall it is a very positive experience. They actually just released a new music pack for those who contributed to the prize pool for TI4. Announcers are something that need mentioning. As each match begins, there is an announcer telling the player various things. Many of these things are inconsequential at the beginning of the match. But as the players take their positions and the action begins the announcer keeps you updated on important events taking place on the map including but not limited to who is dying and what towers are under attack, etc. There are many different announcer packs available and some of them are absolutely hilarious (Glados for example). Is your team losing handily to a team that you should absolutely not? That\u0027s okay, let Glados tell you how badly you are doing. Fan of the game Bastion? There is an announcer for you then. The Steam Workshop is directly integrated with Dota 2 and users have access to the Source engine as well so user created content comes in by the truckload. There are many incredibly good looking \"hats\" for the various heroes that have been created by members of the community and those members actually get paid for the sales of the items, it is not just a cash grab for Valve. Currently there are even custom game modes being created to allow any number of possibilities. As I began this post I will end it, this game is not for everyone but if it does happen to strike a chord with you then you are quite likely to love it.… Expand",

But by far the worst aspect is valve itself. They are simply interested in putting more hats out instead of addressing what the community has been saying since beta. They have, through in-game taunts and announcements, instilled an animosity amongst the players themselves, yet try to control it through a completely ineffective penalty system.

There is aPlease forgive this review it is part of my desire to strengthen my reviewing prowess and is the first all multiplayer game I am reviewing. (Also MetaCritic was crashing hard when posting this) Sorry if it looks weird I couldn\u0027t get it to work so many times. Gameplay/Playability - Can I just put a 10 and call it good? I’ve never played a game with more addicting gameplay. There is a reason this Mod Birthed five games and a new genre of gaming. It is addictive. The constant updates mean that after a Six month break it will be vastly different. The game is hard, and requires time and effort but it will reward you for it. I could spend years discussing the finer side of the gameplay of this game and the way it evolves over time without breaking the surface. 10 Sound – Routinely impressive. The sound quality is great, music to fit the mood and the voice work is incredible. There are well past 90 characters each with multiple layers of voice work. Heroes in the game have lines to interact with each other as they: Walk past each other (friend or enemy), kill a hero, fight a hero and run, assist in killing a hero, survive a big attack. The spells and hero motions become so resourceful that you can react to a sound from a hero well out of sight who is en-route to murder you. Yet you hear it coming and run. Honestly the part of the game that most of the community ignores but it is such a strong factor in the gameplay. 10 Graphics – It is beautiful and graphics intense. Think WoW level of spell textures and scenery/shadows. You need some power to crank this game to full and it will be beautiful and worth it. 10 Story (Community!) – Seeing as this is multiplayer and has no story I will call this Community for this game. The community is crap, I’ve played potentially tens of thousands of hours at this point since the release of Dota Mod back in Warcraft 3. I can say without a shadow of a doubt that ever massive arrogant **** in the world is playing DOTA 2, Right Now! The game is riddled with terrible attitudes and bad sportsmanship. Your games will start with someone who sits in dead silence waiting to last pick then rages at everyone because something happened that they disagree with, these items that invoke such rage would usually be prevented with a simple amount of effort or giving a **** but they would rather stay silent and flame everyone when they don’t get there way. The developers are of no help and have done nothing to fix this issue in three years. At this point im not 100% sure this is a game, it could be a social experiment based on anonymity and arrogance. 0 Replay ability – The game is nothing if not replay-able. With matches averaging around 45 minutes there is nothing to prevent a person from sinking hours of their life into just one more match. 10… Expand",

DOTA 2 is a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) that heavily and competitively focuses on the player versus player (PvP) aspects of gaming. As the PC gameAs gamers on any platform begin to evolve, gaming becomes more than just a leisure activity, and as streaming of player versus player experiences starts to popularize, I find it is very easy to review Defense of the Ancients 2. DOTA 2 is a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) that heavily and competitively focuses on the player versus player (PvP) aspects of gaming. As the PC game develops with its impressive accumulation of unique players every month and its paucity of cons, DOTA 2 achieves the, “Best Free Online Game” award from me. I continue to invest many hours into the game for more than just one reason, merely ranging from the price to its in-depth lore, gameplay, and intense community. First thing is first, DOTA 2 is a free downloadable game you can obtain from Steam, an internet-based digital distribution, digital rights management (DRM), multiplayer, and social networking platform developed by Valve Corporation. Everyone enjoys free things, but what greatly separates this game from different and popular games is the necessity of a computer (desktop or laptop) rather than a console like a PlayStation 4 or an Xbox One. Gaming on computers and laptops is out faming the consoles simply because computers and laptops offer a much more spread out genre of video games. The only upside, in my opinion, of a console over a computer are the graphics and how cheap it is to obtain such graphics, but as beautiful and real as graphics seem on console games, DOTA 2 manages to create some vigorous and vibrant edges and textures. Instances of these tactile textures, cuts, shadowing, and rendering are the heroes or characters and the environment. The trees, rivers and even floors are covered in variances of colors shapes and sizes. Since the map of the MOBA consists of two insanely distinct sides, it is not hard to visualize the crazy and imaginative graphics on either sides of the map. So because the graphics are optical and make it easy to differentiate allies, enemies, and the actions of each means that the game is easy to play. That does not mean the game itself is easy. Not only are the graphics outstanding for this free PC game, but its gameplay is very smooth if you have a computer that can run it. The motions on the screen are compared by no other MOBA out there in addition to its skill level. Although its gameplay is easy going and greatly enjoyable by anyone, one has to master the ways of the game. The skill level required to play such a MOBA is extremely difficult to learn right away. Hours must be strictly put into DOTA 2 in order to familiarize and become comfortable with the intricate mechanics. Learning Defense of the Ancients 2 back to front will be a challenge but with commitment, rewards along the DOTA 2 path will be provided. Winning a game will become much more satisfying and random drops of player customization will pop out of nowhere. The only thing to deal with after that is the community. Any online multiplayer hosts a community in which they all vary from each other. DOTA 2’s community is a bumpy road to travel across with its intense and competitive gamers to the ignorant fools that mess up the gaming experience for everyone. Competitive players are those who do not like to joke around as they take the game very serious. DOTA 2 to a competitive player is like the law to a police officer. It is also like cancer when a competitive player meets up an ignorant child that destroys the gameplay for everyone else, but more importantly to the serious player. It is very intriguing but difficult to cross over that swaying bridge of trolls (gamers that intentionally negate the gaming experience for others) and the competitiveness of the rest of DOTA 2, but the game becomes much more enjoyable. Similar outcomes to mastering the game are achieved when getting over that bridge. This certain game also includes a neat little lore behind all the characters that may take one’s mind of the skill requirement or the annoyance the community brings for just enough time to get back into mindless gaming. It is a clear-cut to me that the writers of DOTA 2’s lore have really put some thought into its characters. Where one hero like Omniknight may support and help others, another may slice through his or her enemy with ease and without remorse like Phantom Assassin. Some characters revolve opportunistic kills that travel across the map without fault like Nature’s Prophet and others are stationary and defensive that wait for a miscalculation in opposing steps like Techies. There is one specific hero that seems quite nice and generous but is really the mastermind behind why a whole war between The Radiant and The Dire broke out. The Radiant are normal and loving human beings and animals that fight against hellish monsters and beasts known as The Dire. The objective of every game is to destroy the opposing team’s ancient. I have spent over 1500 hours on this game and to a committed player, DOTA2 nears perfection.… Expand",

    "comments": "I had fun with Dota 1 which I played for years, then tried League of Legends where I thought to myself that it had a very shallow gameplay except for the staged buying of items, the item filter and the creeping in the woods which was actually part of the game\u0027s concept as there were items specifically for this. So I thought I\u0027d give Dota 2 a try and have to say: What a load of garbage DotaI had fun with Dota 1 which I played for years, then tried League of Legends where I thought to myself that it had a very shallow gameplay except for the staged buying of items, the item filter and the creeping in the woods which was actually part of the game\u0027s concept as there were items specifically for this. So I thought I\u0027d give Dota 2 a try and have to say: What a load of garbage Dota 2 is ! It starts with the menus that lack ANY FORM of description what they do (tooltips anyone ?) and are NOT practical. For example: If I want to config my game I cannot press ESC or F10 to do so. Game standards, please ! Instead I have to click all the icons that have no tooltips to find what does what I want. Once I\u0027m in the config there is the same problem: Lack of helpful tooltips ! So I more or less try and - oh hey: There\u0027s the pause option which is not bound to the P or pause key ! Why even standards ? So I want to bind some stuff - but what\u0027s that ? Certain keys aren\u0027t registered for certain commands while they are for others. Well thanks a lot... There\u0027s also no warning whenever I try to use a key that\u0027s already in use by something else - again: Why even standards ? Ok so I start my first Dota 2, hero selection: I have to scroll through all of them ! What ? How about a table of all heroes to filter by one or more categories ? I\u0027m also allowed to filter by hero name and their assigned role but not whether I want an agility, strength or intellect hero. Thanks again... So after selecting my hero I\u0027m stuck in a hero outfit screen which is literally just for optics. That screen doesn\u0027t explain what\u0027s going on or I am supposed to do to proceed. Solution: Click the button with the hero name on it TWICE to actually get into the game. Horrible menu design ! Tooltips ! Explain what\u0027s going on ! For first time users: Guide me ONCE or make your menus less **** ! So I\u0027m in the game. Everything looks modern but ****. Well, never mind. I\u0027m here for the gaming experience. The game: Currently it\u0027s designed to proceed so fast that games last very short compared to Dota 1. Everything that had some cooldown, mana costs, less damage etc. is now designed to make the game proceed far faster. What happened to turn rates ? What happened to cast animations ? Etc. ... The game has been designed to have no flow that allows for anything but constant hero kills. You know what ? **** this garbage, I uninstalled it. If given the choice I\u0027d rather play League of Legends and far, far, faaar before that (because it\u0027s crap, too) I\u0027d just stay at Dota 1, because it\u0027s far more playable, far better configureable and far less **** designed. Oh and I almost forgot to mention the shop: When clicking on an item that can be part of a crafting set to upgrade to a better item the game doesn\u0027t show me that. Instead I have to KNOW that this item exists, to click on that and only then the menu will show me the reagents for that completed item. Menu design again... If something is part of certain recipes just add that to the item\u0027s info and not only to the completed recipe\u0027s info ! Such a moronic design... Item filters are also garbage. League of Legends does this better by miles. And how about a key config overlay to have vendor hotkeys for certain items ? Or are there some already ? Because the game didn\u0027t show me. It\u0027s nice to offer a tutorial for Dota 2 but either offer specific translations or use text info. And as matter of fact: Explaining doesn\u0027t work well the way Dota 2 explains things: A lot, fast, only once, with no way to repeat anything without having to restart all over again and sometimes not cleary hinting what is what. While Dota has always been about hero killing and tower roaming the increased game flow turns that in such a shallow game that this is not like any of the original Dota - except for the items in the game. If you like it: Well then keep your **** and stay as far away as possible with that badly designed garbage from me, be happy with it and don\u0027t bother me with claiming it\u0027s Dota because it\u0027s not. This is just killparty turbo which is what I loathe League of Legends for. Dota 1 understood tactics, neither League of Legends nor Dota 2 do. It\u0027s all just pew pew fast game. Next one. How about a longer lasting quality game, like Dota1 used to be ? This game should\u0027ve never been made. The only good thing of it is the absence of orb effects and buff placers which is also a bad thing as this shouldn\u0027t have been lifted to 100% for everyone because that actually added some depth into Dota 1 - along with cast animations, attack animations, turn rates, projectile speeds that weren\u0027t ridiculously fast and a game flow that would allow planning on a basic level.… Expand",

I think they forgot that this is the game all the other ones COPIED its heroes from. The only reason you \"think\" the other games are updating themselves is because you didn\u0027t play dota to begin with. This being said, dota 2 lets you use every hero in the game without paying, so that also nullifies the money hungry argument as every other game makes you purchase any new hero, and that hero is overpowered for about a month, so isn\u0027t that pay to win whereas dota\u0027s system is absolute fairness? The only thing you can purchase in the game is cosmetics, Whereas in LoL you can buy runes and different abilities to supplement the characters you also had to pay for. Dota 2 offers everything you could want, a bug free game that is completely free to play and you can be as competitive as you want, you can play as much as you want, you can try any hero you want. Without paying a dime. And you\u0027ll have a good time as long as you are actually trying to enjoy and get to know the game and everyone that plays it will encourage you to do so. The bad reviews on this site come from people who are bad at games in general or from diehard LoL fans that can\u0027t stand that their game is a shadow of the original and now an even uglier shadow in the face of the new Dota.… Expand",

Some days will have a 10mb update which is so good, then here comes the day where it updates at nearly 300mb and another day which updates a harsh fit of 1gb which is very frustrating to players who have a very slow internet connection.

Valve, the developers of dota 2 make tens of millions annually from cosmetics and crowd funded prize pool, but they don\u0027t even have a community manager. There is no way to know if your complaints are being heard and most go unnoticed. There are descriptions of items and hero spells in the game that are flat out wrong and at worse misleading that have never been fixed. The UI keeps getting worse and worse as valve hides everything important under sub menus and makes advertising take precedent.

Since finding four players at your exact level and only playing with a full team is virtually impossible you\u0027re pretty much hosed. Expect 90% of games to be blowouts one way or the other.

Dota 2 is extremely poorly made in every single aspect, from necessary internet needed which is absurd to PS2 graphics that require a super computer to work (which got better after going to source 2 and being COMPLETELY REMADE) the designs of the heroes are mostly over simplified ripoffs of Warcraft 3 characters, and some of them like Arc Warden look so awful you can do nothing but laugh when looking at them. The animation of the creeps attacking is the most boring and uninspired thing I\u0027ve ever seen, they look bored, and so do you after seeing it, its like they are pretending to fight and not actually fighting. Maybe Valve could learn a thing or two from Blizzard\u0027s animations, if you are going to rip them off so much. The game is filled with bugs which are sometimes \"fixed\", the game barely works, and is so pathetically unbalanced it makes Final Fantasy Tactics look like a masterpiece of balancing. The game\u0027s outcome is rarely ever decided through skill or strategy, and mostly by luck, or who happens to have the most overpowered heroes at that specific match. Some heroes like Invoker are purposely overpowered to make them stand out because he is \"hard\" to use compared to other heroes, it is one of the most used heroes in professional games and high rank games, because of how utterly broken he is. The luck is one of the most important factors of Dota 2, which is a joke for a \"competitive\" \"\"\"action\"\"\" game. Most heroes have at least one ability based on RNG, and a lot of the items are also based on it, with a chance of everything happening. How can you take seriously a game which has a 15% chance of dealing x4.5 times the attack\u0027s damage? Or a passive that grants you a chance of using your spells 4 **** times? It is retarded to watch a \"professional\" game where the most important team fight is decided because the alchemist got a stun with the basher 3 times. Clearly all items and abilities which are RNG based could be modified to be turned into a strategic, situational things, but I guess randomness is extremely popular with Dota 2 players (and stupid people in general) it is easier to see competition in League of Legends games, and that is saying something. The balancing is obviously determined by which hero is used or not by the \"pros\", if the pros don\u0027t like a hero, expect it to be buffed until it is so insufferably overpowered it ruins the game simply by existing, then the \"pros\" will start to use it, which is when it starts to get nerfed again. This includes heroes who are mostly RNG-based, so expect x10 crits in the future updates. The game have like, 3 songs total, you will listen to the same **** song every match, everytime, and the same song in the title screen (Valve managed to fix this monotony by making music another item that you can get by giving them money, isn\u0027t that great?) Don\u0027t expect to play with players in the same level, even though they do collect info about you and have a hidden MMR for public matches, expect to see brilliant players being set with noobs who clearly never played heroes which are not Riki or Wraith King. Watch as terrible players win games and great players lose, because of how unbalanced the game is and how stupidly the teams are formed (Valve thinks the average of the players\u0027 MMR are what matters). Matches take more than 3 minutes to be found, which is a joke compared to other online games, even the ones made by smaller companies. But hey, I can deal with awful players and unbalances just fine (and exploit them like everyone else) but Valve\u0027s **** servers are the straw that broke the camel\u0027s back, I am not going to ever play this garbage for a very long time now, and you better fix these servers instead of making more stupid \"cosmetics\".

And of course I started immediately with DoTA 2. And see, before you think I\u0027m just being biased and trying to nitpick this game simply because I\u0027m a LoL fan, trust me, I\u0027m not.

And of course I started immediately with DoTA 2. And see, before you think I\u0027m just being biased and trying to nitpick this game simply because I\u0027m a LoL fan, trust me, I\u0027m not. It\u0027s just that I genuinely think this is a bad game based on my experience. So, before getting into the actual gameplay, I should point out the characters and matchups. First off, this might be a venial thing to point out, but what is up with the characters\u0027 names? Like seriously, it\u0027s quite obvious that the developers just named them directly after their concept. Names like \"Fire Knight\" \"Bloodseeker\" and \"Enchantress\" aren\u0027t exactly what I would call innovative. And why are ALL the characters 100% free to play? Like, it may seem like a really cool feature for some people, but really it\u0027s quite unnecessary. Like, if you really like a certain character, then you should be able to work toward it and make enough money to purchase the character with in-game currency, not just join the game for the first time and have all the characters at your fingertips. What makes this even more stupid is the unbalanced roster. The characters are either really OP or flat-out useless. And the gameplay. It\u0027s already unpleasant, repetitive and boring because, as I said before, the roster of heroes is totally out of balance. But there are another features that bland it even more. I might be most thought of as a scrub for saying this, but why is there no autolock? Like yeah, I get it, if you watch the world championships or DoTA 2 or LoL, you\u0027ll notice the players aren\u0027t using autolock. But I\u0027m speaking from the perspective of a casual, new player in DoTA 2, which I\u0027m sure is why most people are reading this review. Again, this may seem very venial, but it\u0027s a pretty big issue, for me at least. Every time I move my mouse to cast an ability on an enemy, my screen display gets shoved forward, and by the time I\u0027ve returned to my hero the enemy player has already slaughtered me. So then I try to keep it on my hero by consistently keeping my thumb pressed on the spacebar, and by the time the match is over my thumb hurts like hell. Overall, DoTA 2 has greatly disappointed me.… Expand",

Honestly though, contrary to popular opinionDotA 2 is like a good game of chess that has done acid and decided to invite all of its \u0027friends\u0027 over to brutalize and torment the other team. However, instead of tormenting the other team these \u0027friends\u0027 just decide to rail on one another until each \u0027friend\u0027 has to quietly put themselves into offline mode before playing any game on steam. Honestly though, contrary to popular opinion DotA is a very fun game. It is just not a fun game for stupid people or people that are not willing to take some time to learn the game. This game will not spoonfeed you on how to play, nor will it easily allow you to catch up if you make mistakes. Like in the real world if you make mistakes in battle you will suffer. A few tips: Try to keep a level head, and bonus points for a positive attitude. Your team will appreciate it a lot, and they will be more willing to work with you. Pay attention to the map, your surroundings, and your enemies items. Read your abilities carefully, read the patch notes, read the items abilities. Practice heroes in demo mode (this is different from bot practice or private lobby.) Get yourself a mic. Effective communication is one of your biggest utilities. If a hero that is in your lane goes missing call missing immediately. Better safe than sorry. Buy wards. Wards might typically be a supports \u0027job\u0027, but they will save your life and get you kills, which will easily make up for the gold cost. Also, your team will appreciate you that much more, which will result in them being much more likely to try to help you out and listen to you. Use your scan. I find that this tool is way overlooked. At least in my bracket. It\u0027s up every 5 minutes, and it can only help (if not to tell you where someone is; it will tell you where they are not.) Nobody is good at DotA. There is always someone much better than you are. So do your best and try not to talk trash. Treat this as a chance to develop team communication skills Deny creeps as much as you can, but not at the sacrifice of missing a last hit. Buy smoke before a gank or a Rosh kill. They are a cheap invaluable tool. Verbally tell whomever you are around if you are planning on leaving them or TPing out. Experiment with different items when you are fighting different types of heroes. I say this last one with caution because it can hinder your ability to play the game normally, but try Turbo when you first start out. It will allow you to learn heroes more quickly. Okay, actually this is my last point. Try to have fun. It is just a game. Your mostly non-toxic Dota friend, Havoc Octavian Teslasmith… Expand",

Постоянно происходят разные отрубания от сервера, ошибки. До покупки SSD игровой кэш прогружался перед первой картой вплоть до пяти минут. Одна из причин - растущий день ото дня список из отвратных косметических предметов. Второй минус - это сомнительный баланс. Многих героев с переменной частотой смешивают с дерьмом. И самое возмутительное - то, что здесь хорошая игра и победа идут вразрез. Блядская мета с героями, которые выиграют тебе игру если ты их пикнешь. То есть тут побеждает не тот, кто выкладывается на максимум на подходящем герое, а тот, кто взял метового говномеса и делает всё по инструкции, придуманной кем-то совершенно нездоровым. Третий минус. Матчмейкинг и не работающая система наказаний. В подборе игр участвует множество негласных переменных. Кроме рейтинга порядочности, о участии которого в подборе гадские разрабы ДО ПОСЛЕДНЕГО скрывали, в игре есть скрытый рейтинг. Тот, по которому подбираются игры в обычном и турбо-режиме, но который ПОЧЕМУ—ТО также учитывается при подборе рейтинговых игр. Сука, да это, блять, гениально! Просто понижаем последний винрейт в не-рейтинговых играх, а потом отбиваем его в рейтинге. Я так с рыцаря до легенды доабузил, правда после такого всё дольше и дольше ищет игру. В игре невообразимый для обычного игрока входной порог. Чтобы немножко, на базовом уровне научиться играть в эту игру, нужно провести в ней от 1000 часов чистого времени. И планка постоянно растёт, уровень игры на 5000 ММР в 2014 это примерно 3000 ММР сейчас, в 2018. Вдобавок к этому игра очень жёстко наказывает за ошибки, из-за чего игрок проигрывающей стороны может в итоге до 20 минут за игру (игра - 45 минут) просидеть \"в таверне\", беспомощно наблюдая как падает его база. А если в начале игры тебя или твоего тиммейта убили пару раз, ты будешь ощущать это на себе ВСЮ ОСТАВШУЮСЯ ИГРУ. А матчи в этой игре длятся в среднем от 20 до 90 минут. И всё это время ты будешь жалеть, что вообще начал. Резюмируя всё вышесказанное, Dota 2 — игра с худшими левацкими идеями, перенесёнными в игровые механики. Финальная оценка - 0/10.… Expand",
