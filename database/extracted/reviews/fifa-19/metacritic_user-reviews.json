And let me tell you, I\u0027ve never been more underwhelmed. In summary, don\u0027t buy this game if you have 17 or 18.

And let me tell you, I\u0027ve never been more underwhelmed. In summary, don\u0027t buy this game if you have 17 or 18. I know you deserve so much better than this recycled experience, and in your heart, you know it too. How does it compare to FIFA 18? Well, it\u0027s got better graphics, a couple of gameplay adjustments and UEFA Champions League. It\u0027s got an all new commentary team, but that\u0027s just for the Champions League. You\u0027ll still have Martin Tyler and Alan Smith trotting out exactly the same lines they have for the past 7 years in the majority of games - you\u0027re too young to remember this Alan, but goal posts used to be square instead of round. Really Martin, I didn\u0027t know that, it\u0027s not like I haven\u0027t seen three shots go in off the post in this game alone and you\u0027ve said that every time. You\u0027re welcome Alan, why don\u0027t you try a generic statement about a player. Oh, if it had gone between the posts it would have been a goal. Alright, final whistle, goodbye from 2011. Remember everything that frustrates you and annoys you about FIFA 18? Well, it\u0027s all in FIFA 19! The controls are just as unresponsive and inconsistent as FIFA 18. It\u0027s got inconsistent AI all round, defenders that can outpace your fastest wingers and wingers that still outpace all your defenders and the AI can still go from 0-60 in a microsecond while you\u0027re stuck with lead in your boots. They\u0027ll be able to walk it in while your players refuse to respond, and if you do tackle it\u0027ll probably be a foul. Your AI teammates will lunge at the opposition in the box without prompting, giving away penalties. Your players controlled by you will happily walk right through the ball at the opposition\u0027s feet. Big guys get muscled off the ball by, oh, just about everyone. Your players will definitely fail to auto-intercept the ball, even when the opposition fires it straight through them. And the opposition will definitely intercept the many passes of yours that go nowhere they’re told. No, not every game - just every third game or so it\u0027ll make it feel like you\u0027re not part of the game at all. There\u0027s a whole bunch of discussions happened around how FIFA games have been scripted, and EA have denied it. I believe EA: the games aren\u0027t scripted, but the AI difficulty is abysmal and entirely arbitrary. A while ago EA said that FIFA was realistic and so there was a random element to everything you did. That randomness apparently extends to everything: ball control, refs, all the AI. Of course, except for about one game in three, and then suddenly you’re a passenger. You may as well just put down the controller and admire it: at regular points in those matches the game will do what rarely happens in real life professional football and walk the ball through the middle of your defence and distinctly unrealistic speeds. And I\u0027m not saying that doesn\u0027t happen in real life. But for a game that\u0027s apparently striving for realism, it happens a lot compared to real life. And it happens at the same points - say, when you\u0027re about to win a FUT division title. Coincidence? I don\u0027t know. It\u0027s not all bad. Being absolutely honest, the moments when you can fox the AI that\u0027s been running rings around you by 20-30 buildup passes, breaking down their defence and slotting in a perfect cross are great. And I was enjoying a lot of it. But the game also recognises - and the commentators will mention - when you\u0027re deliberately holding up play. And if you do get tripped up, or your pass goes in the wrong direction for no reason, the reason you\u0027re doing it will become painfully clear. Because as soon as you lose possession, the game will punish you. FIFA 19 barely looks better than the others and plays almost exactly the same. FIFA has been stagnant for a while, and only impresses the terminally credulous, who look to hand over as much real cash as they can for FIFA Points. But this is the first time in a long time I feel like the series has demonstrated how stagnated its developers are: more interested in modelling faces we can barely see for the majority of the game than making it a good game. The new timed shot is a step in the right direction, but for yet another year of yet another AAA priced game with yet more microtransactions, and losing all that progress, it\u0027s not enough. It\u0027s one thing that could go some way to making player mistakes more about skill than just saying that \"random is reality\". When it comes down to it, football fans pay a lot for football products. Not only going to the games, but getting merchandise, and paying for TV. We pay other people good money to show us reality, to show us dodgy decisions, to show us things that happen randomly on the pitch. No one wants this random stuff thrown into a game world - where we\u0027d rather rely on our own actions than std::srand().… ",

I am a keyboard player since FIFA 2001, as the year passed it was more difficult to play with a keyboard against players with a controller, but this year\u0027s FIFA is absolutely ridiculous. Defense: - Unbelievably hard. If you play against an opponent that uses a controller, you will be outmatched most of the time, simply because he can move to directions that can\u0027t be done with a keyboard. - Player AI is the most stupid yet. Really shocking actually. Only the player you control shows some passion, all the other are standing there like some rag dolls, running casually. - The ball bounces off so much from the players, that is can randomly find the opponent in front of an open goal. - Every corner is a bicycle kick to your face (or net). Offence: - Maybe you thought that you can concede 4 but score 5, well sadly this year it is extremely hard to score with a keyboard. - Limited directions. You can shoot only to the middle, far left or far right because of keyboard limitations, but it has zero optimization! Almost every shot is to the post, or to the crowd. - Penalties- again, zero optimization. 3 directions, to the post or out most of the time. - Free kicks- I don\u0027t know how they work. I did 10 times the same thing and got 10 different outcomes. Other: - The Division rivals suck in my opinion, makes you a slave to the game. No more casual play in ultimate team. - If you are a keyboard player and still don\u0027t believe me, just play the skill games, and see how limited you are. For me, as a keyboard player, this is the worst FIFA I have ever played. Thank you EA for **** over the keyboard players, making it impossible to play against players with a controller, and even against the AI at higher difficulties.… ",

But I like football games much better the \"FIFA way\", and still I appreciate sometimes to go for few PES \"style\" matches...because by it´s way is really good too. That is actually really good for us, because we have TWO options to pick. First, which tries to be as realistic as it can ( PES 2019 ) and the Second, which is less realistic ( FIFA 19 ), but has a story mode ( which is cheesy a little bit, but still appreciated ), a lot of game modes which are actually fun ( House of rules ) if you don´t want to play a serious match just want to have some fun with your friends...and as I told I actually love the base gameplay too. So that´s all folks. Please don´t want FIFA to become PES. I don´t think so, that we want to have 2 exactly same football games from two different companies. Just switch...you have the option.

Now we have Origin Access and Origin Access Premier and games are being added to the vault as part of a Software as a Service deal. The old FIFAs were made for people who were willing to spend more for a single game every year than we pay for all new EA releases. Right now they are made for the people who feel they might try FIFA, they might try NFS, they might try Madden NFL, they might try Anthem but they aren\u0027t diehard fans of the sport. There are plenty of ways to adjust difficulty, and even absolute newbies can win matches at low enough difficulty and make progress in Career mode. That is good, and the Journey can be an interesting addition to the game. But for this kind of market the game would need far more in game help, far better manual. Because this time people who are gamers but don\u0027t know much about soccer might pick up. People who love manager / tycoon games might pick up this game for \"manager mode\". And we might be underwhelmed by amount of choices we have. Girls might pick up this game, just to try it. And they might find it annoying that you can\u0027t have a female manager, can\u0027t manage a female team, and can\u0027t have a career women\u0027s soccer. The commentary is repetitive and annoying. Handling on keyboard + mouse is bad. And what is even worse: The game has no useful in game help and no useful in game manuals. People who have Origin Access or Origin Access Premier and might try something new and install FIFA for this reason won\u0027t know the difference between ST and CF without any kind of help (and tooltips, etc) explaining it. Without this it is like a half finished, early access, indie game with slowdowns due to unwanted AAA graphics. EA tries to monetize the game too much with FUT, but that is a game mode most of the new players will ignore and most of the returning players hate already and it adds to lootbox controversy around all EA games. If they want more income: It would be nice if EA would let clubs, etc. to sell merchandise (real merchandise) in an in game store and there would be exclusive items for FIFA players. Like \"team jerseys for your own FIFA player\", etc. It would be nice if there would be a game mode where you can take the role of a \"wannabe tycoon\" who decides to invest money into the sport, etc. to show other sides of soccer and serve a wider audience. Spending money on better graphics and more (repetitive and annoying commentary) while people complain about gameplay is bad. Also seeing the match as a TV broadcast breaks the immersion. If you are a manager or player you would see it differently.… ",

The new transfer shortlist is excrescent and youth players always reject loan offers. The referee is blind and senseless when it comes the faults. You can get yellow/red card for almost everything. Do not ever try to tackle inside the penalty area because the player will throw himself/herself up. The gameplay is improbable. The AI on your team is horrendous but the CPU hardly ever makes mistakes. Passes are imprecise and frail. Open shoots and long-range shoots are miserable but you can head in every ball from near post 0 degree angle. Every ball which come back from the post finds the opponent striker. Keepers make loads of mistakes especially when they are above 85 overall. Pace is just a number. Almost no chance to open any of the rare players in UT. Market prices are up in the skies. You cannot log in from phone if you lost your connection on PC/console. I personally suppose it was the worst decision of 2018 when i bought this game. I should have read the reviews before buying it. If you ask me i would not recommend this game to anyone who care about their nerve system and time.

And every single IA shot is the same, a perfect strike at 200 kph to the squad. (doesn´t matter if the player has 30 in shot power and 20 in finishing). In summary: The gameplay is the same of every year with 2 or 3 insignificant new things. Modes like career mode are just the same. Difficulty is unbalanced (IA plays really bad, but anyways it scores when it wants) and every game has a lot of goals (I\u0027ve never seen a 0-0 or 1-0 game, there is always at least 2 or 3 goals, and usually more).

Le squadre piú deboli che d\u0027improvviso diventano imbattibili e sembrano giocare con fenomenali top player.

Solo dopo un mese é arrivato il fix. Interessanti le coreografie prepartita sugli spalti, ma sono pochissime e si continuano a ripetere.

Use PeerBlock to figure out how broken matchmaking is. Higher divisions are populated as usual with unplayable opponents, mostly due to them playing on crap hardware (if you experience huge stutters/freezes during cutscenes, long load times, you know you\u0027re in for a treat). The matchmaking will match you with anyone, no matter the ping. Lag determines the outcome of the game and kills the skill gap. You end up conceding **** goals against **** opponents that just park the bus and mash buttons once you reach divisions 2/1. Your opponent lives at the other end of the world and has 300ms ping ? No problem dude. This is Division 1 ! Git gud ! This is a football game where passing and defending do not matter. The key is to lag and ruin the framerate to kill the gameplay and piss off your opponents with laughable goals. It\u0027s an unplayable mess that can frustrate any player and make them feel bad. 1/10 because all EA cares about is milking players with the pay-to-win rigged mode. Marketing this gambling game as a competitive e-sport game is a joke. PS: Bought it during winter sales to avoid post-launch bugs and gameplay changing every week with crappy patches.

Player control is the worst of the whole series (and I\u0027m not talking about the ball control) feals like trying to control trucks disguised as human beeings and everything is scripted in their move. Many timesI start playing FIFA since 1997 and this FIFA it\u0027s...pure garbage, it\u0027s a game that you want to give to someone you really hate it. This will be the perfect blow to his morale. Player control is the worst of the whole series (and I\u0027m not talking about the ball control) feals like trying to control trucks disguised as human beeings and everything is scripted in their move. Many times they just keep doing their run to nowhere giving you the feeling they are like on some invisible tram tracks no matter if you keep pushing like crazy to stop, the script in their behavior is doing the job There is always like an invisible hand working for the Ai players in duels of 1 vs 1 that will drag your player, teleportating him from controlling the ball in the back of his Ai opponent. When you try to do the same, it\u0027s like fighting a bull Ai ball interception. On ultimate the Ai players have like an 360 range all around them to intercept the ball 99% they will succeed it if the balls goes in that range of 360 all around them, no matter if it\u0027s on the ground or in the air, could be in the ground, they will still intercept it while your players gonna give you that move \"ooh, it just passed under me, couldn\u0027t do anything but let\u0027s keep trying, you keep pushing the buttons while i\u0027m gonna pretend it didn\u0027t work only for you\" Double player, don\u0027t do it, don\u0027t use it! The second players always come and ruin your other player work till that moment, many times will just collide with him preventing him to get the ball and this happened 99% of the time it\u0027s being used. And before the need to collide with his teammate, all the time he needs to go behind your player and your opponent no matter if he came from the front of them. This have nothing to do with a bug, a script or a misleading animation, this have something to do with the people who work at EA Canada, people with too many rights, with the right to get in love with a colleague of the same gender and then express that in a game, protected by ...nobody can really proof that, even if that stupid move it may happend in real football matches like 0,01% of a game and it\u0027s not the only place I saw it. When you prepare to throw from the line, you see your players who are in good positions, most of the time, like 50% of the time, suddenly they will change this by going behinde their opponents, agin this need To put a guy behind another guy and touching it like...c\u0027mon \"guys\" it\u0027s just a game, go with your idiotic fantasy somewhere else. This disgusting me, bleah.. If 2 players collide each other or an Ai player bump into you, 100% all the time the Refs decide against you The ball Works different for the Ai and you. There are cases when the ball it\u0027s in the air and you are much close to it then the Ai players and in that moment the ball feels like it\u0027s a balon and till an Ai player will be in the spot to fight for this ball, will barely came down. When the situation is reversed, the ball descends as if it were from stone. There are other cases when the ball is almost going out, but an Ai player is near by, so in that moment the ball is like having his own brakes, always somehow is waiting the AI player, but when you are close and desperately try to get it, the ball get some speed from nowhere just to touch, a bit the white line, a microscopic touch and bamm, the ball is out for you. Clean area Every time an Ai player who is with his back at my gate he surprisingly kick the ball with 100% accuracy to his forward players, all the time, every time Nano Microscopic offsides as always Referees sucks. They are there to be an physical obstacle only when you are in attack never against the Ai and if the Ai is doing a normal booking the Ref will give him a pet talk, but if you do less than that and the score on the table is in your favor, the Ref came like a storm in front of you with with lot of drama showing you the yellow card right away(only if he could had a gun in that moment, EA style of thinking) and if the score on the table is in your favor, well, from that moment you are being hunted by the Refs all the time. Extra time. Works grat for the Ai, never for you. When the ball is in the AI possession, the extra time keep going till the AI fulfilled his opportunity but when it\u0027s your turn, bang, game over right away. The refs will never stop an Ai attack, for this I throw out the ball 20 times and the refs never bother to stop the game, but he will stop you, no matter if you just got a second corner, it will always stop you. this doesn\u0027t feel fair. I won many games on ultimate vs Ai with scores like 9-1, 8-0, 13-1 vs big teams in the game in a 9 minutes game with Barcelona team vs Juve vs Arsenal..and sometimes using just a keyboard, this should tell ya how \"great\" is this game. And i\u0027ll tell you more in time, but till then my score is 1 for the effort To Be continued… ",

The game is getting worse and worse every year but this time the number of bugs is just incredible. After half a year the game still wasn\u0027t fully fixed. Mind you it is pretty much the game they did last year, same engine, same features, same look. Just a different number and somehow they managed to destroy it so much before lunch. On top of it all the gameplay alone, the idiotic behavior of players that sometimes can even take control and ignore user input is just great. It always was a bit problematic but this time I have no words. And complete randomness of NPCs is just sometimes amazing. the winner is not the one who plays better but the one who can exploit the system mistakes better. + removing features that were in previous versions like recording replays also very flawed and buggy online system that sometimes forces you to play with game freezing for a moment every 3-5 seconds because if you leave a game like that its a loss (i guarante it is not a fault of my computer or internet connection since I play any other game I want at 60+ fps at high settings with max 40 ping). Got the game as a present and there is no chance I will buy it for years to come if nothing changes for the better.… ",

And to be honest the game is really just an overpriced FIFA 18 update. It\u0027s really the graphics that made me change from my initial rating of 1.",

I cannot imagine it being even worse than that. It gives absolute power to randomness in this game. How come corner kicks, crosses and long shots can be way more effective than a 1vs1 situation?!",

Repito, una cosa es que el equipo rival te dificulte jugar y otra es que el juego conspire en tu contra, malos pases, rebotes increíbles, tiros a los postes, etc. Creo que es lamentable el videojuego, más allá de la experiencia.
